<h3 id="advocate-general-for-scotland">Advocate General for Scotland</h3>
<p>The Advocate General for Scotland is one of the Law Officers of the Crown, who advise the government on Scots law.</p>

<p>Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act requires that the Advocate General be provided with notice of all ‘devolution issues’ raised before courts or tribunals in Scotland. Devolution issues include challenges to the legislative competence of an Act of the Scottish Parliament and to whether a member of the Scottish government has complied with the EU Convention on Human Rights or EU Community law.</p>

<p>The Advocate General can choose intervene, on behalf of the UK government, in proceedings in which devolution issues have been raised if he so decides.</p>

<p>The Office of the Advocate General considers all Scottish Parliament Bills as they progress, in consultation with interested UK government departments, to assess their legislative competency.  Under section 33 of the Scotland Act, the Advocate General has the power to refer Scottish Parliament Bills to the Supreme Court for decisions on their legislative competence.</p>

<h3 id="moj-spokesperson-for-the-lords">MoJ spokesperson for the Lords</h3>

<p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson for the Lords is responsible for all departmental business in the Lords. He also advises the Secretary of State for Justice on the following policy areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>civil justice (including discount rate and whiplash)</li>
  <li>legal services</li>
  <li>Global Britain</li>
  <li>relationship with the legal profession</li>
