<p>Thank you, Mr Chair. Later today, we will hear from the esteemed experts who have compiled the second Moscow Mechanism report on Violations of International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity in Ukraine. So many have suffered so much at the hands of Russia’s unjustifiable aggression; the report covers only a fraction of their stories.</p>

<p>Both Moscow Mechanism reports document acts of sexual violence carried out by members of the Russian Armed Forces. This evidence exists because of the bravery of survivors, who, by telling their stories, break down stigma and enable justice. Their courage is striking when juxtaposed with the cowardice of their attackers, who hide behind propaganda spread by Russian government officials – including words spoken in this Council. Denying crimes of sexual violence is tantamount to defending them. Colleagues, I repeat the message that the UK has delivered many times: the use of sexual violence as a weapon is a war crime. We, the international community, will end impunity for sexual violence and hold those responsible to account.</p>

<p>Women are disproportionately affected by conflict, and are at far greater risk of gender based, and conflict related sexual violence. Despite this, in times of war, women are also often the first responders to a crisis, stepping up to serve their communities. This is true in Ukraine, where women have been instrumental to the humanitarian, political, and security efforts in the defence of their country and I would like to use the rest of my statement to highlight their vital contributions.</p>

<p>Women worked to build a democratic and free Ukraine. Now, they are an integral part of the government’s response to Russia’s illegal actions that threaten it. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has worked around the clock to facilitate the evacuation of civilians to places of safety. Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna, is working to deliver services to the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>As reported by the United Nations, many female leaders at all levels in Ukraine have been taking charge by spearheading the country’s humanitarian response, joining the army or leading public service delivery. Female health workers and entrepreneurs are providing essential services and goods to the war-affected population, with women’s organisations on the ground leading humanitarian assistance, advocacy and public outreach to support their communities. In recognition of this, the UK has launched a fund to support Ukrainian women leaders and women’s rights organisations steadfastly serving their communities, and focused on the critical needs of women and children.</p>

<p>The bravery of the women of Ukraine in the face of Russian atrocities and war crimes embodies the resilience and spirit of the Ukrainian people. We commend the work of Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, in leading Ukraine’s response to these despicable acts, and the female law enforcement officers, civil society representatives and human rights defenders that continue to carry out their work with dignity, despite the hardships being faced by many.</p>

<p>We must acknowledge the huge contribution of female Ukrainian journalists, keeping the world informed of Russia’s horrific actions in their country. I pay tribute to the work, for example, of Olga Rudenko and the team at the Kyiv Independent, who have worked tirelessly since the invasion, making their news outlet – only fourteen weeks old when the first Russian rockets hit Kyiv – one of the most relied-upon English-language news sources in Ukraine.</p>

<p>These mothers, daughters, sisters and protectors of Ukraine demonstrate strength, compassion and integrity in support of the defence and governance of their country, their people and their principles, in what are for many, unimaginable circumstances. We stand with them, as we stand with all of Ukraine. President Putin’s aggressive imperialism will never prevail.</p>

<p>Mr. Chair, I conclude by reiterating the urgent call for the immediate release of OSCE SMM staff still in detention. Russia’s actions demonstrate contempt for this organisation and for its international commitments – and they will be held accountable for it.</p>
