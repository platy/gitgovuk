<p>Good afternoon,</p>

<p>before turning to the topic of visit we have had, the fantastic visit we’ve had here in India,</p>

<p>I just want to say something about the latest situation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Because I know everyone is deeply concerned about events, the barbarism we have seen, that barbarism by Vladimir Putin in the Donbas region,</p>

<p>and in particular his brutal offensive against Mariupol,</p>

<p>which is why yesterday I announced we would be sending more artillery and doing everything possible to help the people of Ukraine defend themselves those areas.</p>

<p>And at the same time, the extraordinary fortitude and success of President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people in resisting Russian forces in Kyiv,</p>

<p>means that I can today announce shortly, next week, we will re-open our embassy in Ukraine’s capital city.</p>

<p>I want to pay tribute to those British diplomats who remained elsewhere in the region throughout this period.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and our allies will not watch passively as Putin caries on this onslaught.</p>

<p>And what I think we’ve seen here in New Delhi</p>

<p>is one of the world’s oldest democracies, and the largest democracy, sticking together,</p>

<p>And confronting our shared anxieties about autocracies and autocratic coercion around the world</p>

<p>and acting together to make our countries safer and more prosperous.</p>

<p>Our new and expanded Defence and Security Partnership</p>

<p>will enable India to strengthen its own domestic defence industry</p>

<p>as well as protecting vital shared interests in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>Our collaboration on energy security</p>

<p>– including our new offer on offshore wind, the new UK-India Hydrogen Science and Innovation Hub and our joint work on solar power –</p>

<p>will help to reduce our collective dependence on imported hydrocarbons in favour of cheaper, more sustainable home-grown renewables.</p>

<p>And our Global Innovation Partnership will help transfer climate and energy-smart innovations to developing countries across the wider Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p>As we deepen the partnership between our countries, we won’t just make our people safer, we’ll make them more prosperous too,</p>

<p>creating new jobs, driving up wages, and driving down prices for consumers,</p>

<p>all of which will helps with the cost of living.</p>

<p>And our partnership with India is particularly powerful in achieving these things</p>

<p>because India is an incredible rising power in Asia,</p>

<p>with one of the fastest growing economies in the world</p>

<p>– already worth £2.25 trillion –</p>

<p>and set to be the world’s third largest economy by 2050.</p>

<p>India is also our biggest partner in the Indo-Pacific,</p>

<p>which is increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world,</p>

<p>with two-thirds of humanity, and a third of the global economy – and that share is rising every year.</p>

<p>Indian investment already supports almost half a million British jobs,</p>

<p>and with a population bigger than the US and the EU combined,</p>

<p>there is so much potential for us to take our trade and investment to a whole new level.</p>

<p>On this visit alone we’ve secured new deals worth £1 billion, creating more than 11,000 jobs.</p>

<p>And perhaps most significantly of all, we’re using our Brexit freedoms to reach a bi-lateral Free Trade Agreement,</p>

<p>and today Prime Minister Modi and I told our negotiators</p>

<p>to get it done by Diwali in October.</p>

<p>This could double our trade and investment by the end of the decade,</p>

<p>driving down prices for consumers,</p>

<p>and increasing wages across the UK by as much as £3 billion.</p>

<p>So what we have been getting on with here</p>

<p>is getting on with the job of delivering on the priorities of the British people,</p>

<p>deepening a friendship with a nation with whom we have profound ties of culture, language and kinship,</p>

<p>while making both our countries safer and our economies stronger.</p>
