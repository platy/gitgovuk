<p>Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on our support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>It’s almost four months since Putin launched this illegal war, bringing untold suffering to the innocent people of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom has stood at Ukraine’s side throughout.</p>

<p>We have led the charge in the G7, delivering six waves of unprecedented, coordinated sanctions causing a £256 billion hit to the Russian economy.</p>

<p>The UK has pledged over £1 billion in economic and humanitarian support to Ukraine – making us the third largest bilateral humanitarian donor.</p>

<p>And we were the first European country to deliver military aid – from armoured vehicles to multiple-launch rocket systems. This has spurred others to step up their support.</p>

<p>This united effort has been vital to back Ukraine.</p>

<p>But we are now approaching a critical moment.</p>

<p>Russia is bombarding towns and cities in the East.</p>

<p>Some outside Ukraine are questioning whether the free world can sustain its support and claiming that some are beginning  to tire of this war.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, the people of Ukraine do not have that luxury.</p>

<p>Our answer must be clear. We will never tire of defending freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>Russian aggression cannot be appeased.</p>

<p>It will be met with strength.</p>

<p>We know what is happening on the ground in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Evidence grows of heinous war crimes – the butchery of innocent Ukrainian civilians, rape, torture, and abduction.</p>

<p>We will ensure that these crimes are fully investigated and that justice is done.</p>

<p>Russian proxies are breaching the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war – including the targeting of British citizens.</p>

<p>I utterly condemn these actions.</p>

<p>We are working through the Ukrainian authorities to secure their release and hold Russia to account. I am in close contact with my Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba.</p>

<p>Allowing aggression to succeed would only bring further conflict and misery – and this war would not stop in Ukraine.</p>

<p>So we are committed to stepping up our commitment to Ukraine, maintaining the pressure on Russia’s economy, and entrenching the policy of containment and isolation of Russia.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks leaders will meet at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and at the G7, G20 and NATO summits.</p>

<p>These meetings are an opportunity to stand with Ukraine and stand up for sovereignty and freedom.</p>

<p>Ukraine can and must win this war.</p>

<p>We will never backslide on our commitments however long the conflict goes on.</p>

<p>Our determination to defend our principles will outmatch that of the aggressors.</p>

<p>The result of Putin’s aggression so far has been to unite the free world.</p>

<p>We are stronger now than we were four months ago – and Russia is weaker.</p>

<p>We must maintain this unity.</p>

<p>We must be relentless in delivering military aid at this critical time.</p>

<p>This includes long-range weapons and other vital needs, and improving the quality of Ukraine’s military equipment to long term to NATO standards.</p>

<p>That’s why my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister launched the UK-Poland Joint Commission in early April and we are working with Ukraine and other allies to shape its future defence strategy and deter future aggression.</p>

<p>We must also back Ukraine in negotiations.</p>

<p>So far Russia has shown they are not serious about negotiations.</p>

<p>We cannot allow Ukraine to be pressured into giving up territory in a way that we would never accept ourselves.</p>

<p>Through the G7 and NATO we are doing everything we can to strengthen Ukraine’s hand.</p>

<p>We also need to make sure our Baltic friends and our Polish friends are involved.</p>

<p>Sanctions must be kept in place while Russian boots are on Ukrainian soil.</p>

<p>And we must keep increasing the pressure.</p>

<p>Today I have announced our latest sanctions package.</p>

<p>This includes Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who has repeatedly abused his position to justify the war.</p>

<p>It includes Russia Children’s Rights Commissioner, who has orchestrated a policy that enables the forced transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children into Russia.</p>

<p>And it includes four further collaborators in the breakaway republics for their collusion in the occupation.</p>

<p>While our immediate priority must be to help Ukraine win the war, we are also working to rebuild the country as fast as possible – with a new Marshall Plan.</p>

<p>At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano next month we will rally the international reconstruction effort, urging all our partners to bring ambitious offers to the table.</p>

<p>I am working with Minister Kuleba on new investment into Kyiv and to help reconstruct those towns in the region that have been liberated from Russia’s destructive occupation.</p>

<p>Russia’s efforts to destroy Ukraine will only lead to it becoming a stronger, more prosperous, and more united European nation.</p>

<p>We must also end Russia’s attack on global food security.</p>

<p>The Kremlin is blockading Ukrainian ports, shelling civilian infrastructure and preventing Ukraine from exporting its produce.</p>

<p>By driving up food prices and creating shortages they are punishing the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.</p>

<p>At the same time they are peddling lies and disinformation, claiming that the problems are because of sanctions.</p>

<p>We are exposing these lies.</p>

<p>And we are working with our partners to unlock the export of grain and open the commercial shipping routes.</p>

<p>We will stand with our friends in the Commonwealth and beyond who are suffering.</p>

<p>In the long run there must be consequences for Russia’s actions.</p>

<p>For would-be aggressors everywhere, Putin must not only lose this war, he must also be denied any benefit from it.</p>

<p>Any future aggression must be prevented and Russia must be isolated on the world stage.</p>

<p>Ukraine must prevail – for the good of its people and to uphold the fundamental principles of sovereignty, self-determination, freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>The UK stands with Ukraine for the long haul.</p>

<p>I commend this statement to the House.</p>
