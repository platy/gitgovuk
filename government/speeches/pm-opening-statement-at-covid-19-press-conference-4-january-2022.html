          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Previous waves of the pandemic did not have a single day with more than 100,000 new cases reported.</p>

<p>On one day last week we had 200,000 people test positive.</p>

<p>And the latest figure today is another 218,000, though that includes some delayed reports.</p>

<p>So anyone who thinks our battle with Covid is over is, I’m afraid, profoundly wrong.</p>

<p>This is a moment for the utmost caution.</p>

<p>But our position today differs from previous waves in two crucial respects.</p>

<p>First, we now know that Omicron is milder than previous variants,</p>

<p>so while hospital admissions are rising quickly</p>

<p>with over 15,000 Covid patients now in hospital in England alone -</p>

<p>this is not yet, thankfully, translating into the same numbers needing intensive care that we saw in previous waves.</p>

<p>And second, thanks to the fantastic national effort to get Britain boosted,</p>

<p>we now have a substantial level of protection, higher than any of our European neighbours,</p>

<p>with over 34 million boosters administered,</p>

<p>including in England reaching more than 90 per cent of the over-70s,</p>

<p>and 86 per cent of the over-50s.</p>

<p>And so together with the Plan B measures that we introduced before Christmas,</p>

<p>we have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again.</p>

<p>We can keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus.</p>

<p>But the weeks ahead are going to be challenging, both here in the UK and across the world.</p>

<p>There is no escaping the fact that some services will be disrupted by staff absences,</p>

<p>but we have been working through Christmas to prepare for this wherever possible.</p>

<p>And if we all play our part in containing the spread of this virus</p>

<p>the disruptions we face can be far less severe than a national lockdown, with all the devastation that would bring for livelihoods and the life chances of our children.</p>

<p>So the government is acting to protect critical national services,</p>

<p>keep supply chains open,</p>

<p>and fortify our NHS to withstand the pressures ahead.</p>

<p>We’ve identified 100,000 critical workers,</p>

<p>in areas from food processing to transport to our border force -</p>

<p>and from 10 January we’ll be rolling out lateral flow testing for all these workers, available on every working day.</p>

<p>We’ll be sending testing kits directly to these organisations and liaising with them on the logistics.</p>

<p>We’ve asked qualified teachers who have left the profession to come back and help fill temporary absences,</p>

<p>and I want to thank them and all teachers, parents and pupils for taking the precaution to test yourselves and to wear a mask in the classroom, enabling vital face-to-face education to continue.</p>

<p>We’re increasing NHS capacity by building onsite Nightingale hospitals,</p>

<p>as well as creating 2,500 virtual beds where people can be safely treated at home.</p>

<p>We’ve bought more antivirals per person than anywhere else in Europe those are the tablets which reduce your chances of going to hospital once you’ve caught Covid.</p>

<p>We’re mobilising our volunteers</p>

<p>– the emerging territorial army of the NHS –</p>

<p>and we’re working to identify those NHS Trusts which are most likely to need actual military support, so this can be prepared now.</p>

<p>As our NHS moves to a war footing, I will be recommending to Cabinet tomorrow that we continue with Plan B,</p>

<p>because the public have responded and changed their behaviour, your behaviour, buying valuable time to get boosters in arms and help the NHS to cope with the Omicron wave.</p>

<p>So please carry on observing those measures for now.</p>

<p>Work from home if you can.</p>

<p>Wear face coverings on public transport and in indoor public places,</p>

<p>and take a test before you go to a high-risk venue or meet those who are elderly or vulnerable.</p>

<p>And follow the relevant rules if you live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Above all, if you haven’t already done so please, please get that booster.</p>

<p>Since I launched the Get Boosted Now campaign on 12 December:</p>

<p>we have delivered 10 million extra boosters across the UK;</p>

<p>we have doubled the rate of vaccination from 450,000 doses a day to a peak of more than 900,000;</p>

<p>we matched the NHS’s previous record day, and then beat it again and again;</p>

<p>and we met our target of offering a booster to every eligible adult a whole month early.</p>

<p>The freedoms we are able to maintain in the teeth of this Omicron wave</p>

<p>have been made possible by the number of people getting boosted,</p>

<p>and I want to thank again, everyone who assisted this extraordinary national effort over Christmas.</p>

<p>Our GPs and their teams, pharmacists and everyone in our fantastic NHS,</p>

<p>the thousands of volunteers,</p>

<p>the ingenious initiatives of local communities,</p>

<p>like the one in Redbridge Town Hall which vaccinated 1,700 people on Christmas Day -</p>

<p>and every one of you who has come forward and done your bit by getting jabbed.</p>

<p>But there are still almost 9 million people eligible, who haven’t had their booster,</p>

<p>And it’s absolutely heart-breaking that as many as 90 per cent of those in intensive care with Covid have not had their booster,</p>

<p>and over 60 per cent of those in Intensive Care, who have Covid, have not had any vaccination at all.</p>

<p>People are dying needlessly because they haven’t had their jabs,</p>

<p>they haven’t had that booster.</p>

<p>And there are 2 million booster slots available this week alone.</p>

<p>It’s already the case that to travel to some countries you need a booster to be considered fully vaccinated,</p>

<p>and it’s likely that within weeks this will increasingly become the norm.</p>

<p>So if you haven’t done it already, get yourself boosted this month.</p>

<p>Exactly a year after the UK administered the first AstraZeneca vaccine,</p>

<p>a British invention that has enabled 2.5 billion jabs around the world -</p>

<p>the best way to contain this virus, help our NHS, and keep our country open,</p>

<p>is to get boosted, and so please, Get Boosted Now.</p>
