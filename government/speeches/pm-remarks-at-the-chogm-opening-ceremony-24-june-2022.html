<p>Your Royal Highness,</p>

<p>President Kagame,</p>

<p>Madam Secretary General,</p>

<p>Your Excellencies,</p>

<p>ladies and gentlemen,</p>

<p>I’m honoured to perform the final duty of the United Kingdom as Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth</p>

<p>and hand over the baton to President Kagame,&nbsp;&nbsp; and wish him every success as Chair of our unique association,</p>

<p>encompassing 54 countries and a third of humanity.</p>

<p>One of the newest members is now at the helm,</p>

<p>and more nations are seeking to join,</p>

<p>which tells you everything about the health and vitality of our Commonwealth,</p>

<p>because for all the differences between us,</p>

<p>we are united by an invisible thread of shared values, history and friendship.</p>

<p>The Head of the Commonwealth, Her Majesty the Queen, incarnates everything that brings us together</p>

<p>and it’s fitting that in the year of her Platinum Jubilee,</p>

<p>the association she cherishes should be gathering in the continent where she became Queen.</p>

<p>When the UK became your Chair-in-Office in 2018, the word “Covid” had not been invented</p>

<p>many of us had no idea what a “coronavirus” was,&nbsp;&nbsp; and nobody could have known that the worst pandemic for a century would soon claim millions of lives.</p>

<p>The British government put together the partnership between Oxford University and AstraZeneca that produced the world’s most popular vaccine,</p>

<p>and during our time as Chair-in-Office, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the UK supported the delivery of more than&nbsp;1.4 billion doses of Covid vaccines to Commonwealth countries.</p>

<p>The pandemic posed a common threat to all humanity&nbsp; and the same is true of catastrophic climate change.</p>

<p>No-one understands this better than our Commonwealth friends in the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean</p>

<p>who can see the incoming tides surging ever higher up their beaches,</p>

<p>threatening to inundate their villages and towns,</p>

<p>and, in time, the entire land mass of some island states.</p>

<p>For them, the baleful effects of climate change are not vague or theoretical,</p>

<p>but already happening before their eyes.</p>

<p>When we hosted COP26 in Glasgow last November,</p>

<p>it was these fellow Commonwealth leaders who spoke with greatest urgency and authority about the perils of quilting the earth with greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>And we in the developed world have an obligation to help our friends to cope with a danger they had no hand in causing,</p>

<p>and during the UK’s time as Chair-in-Office,</p>

<p>the Commonwealth Finance Access Hub mobilised over $38 million for the most vulnerable members,</p>

<p>but of course we must press on and do more.</p>

<p>And if I could imagine a silver bullet that would solve an array of problems and transform countless lives,</p>

<p>it would be to give every girl in the world the chance to go to school.</p>

<p>At the last CHOGM in London in 2018, the UK announced £212 million for the Girls’ Education Challenge,</p>

<p>and I’m delighted to say that this initiative is now at work in 11 Commonwealth countries,</p>

<p>ensuring that girls are able to gain at least 12 years of quality education.</p>

<p>We need to empower them to play their full part in the economy when they leave school,</p>

<p>so the UK is funding the “She Trades” Commonwealth programme,</p>

<p>which has already helped over 3,500 women-owned businesses to become more competitive and generate more than £32 million of sales.</p>

<p>And if there is anyone who doubts the ability of the Commonwealth to speak with one voice,</p>

<p>it was in 2020 that the UK delivered the first ever Joint Statement by all 54 Commonwealth members before the Human Rights Council in Geneva,</p>

<p>recalling – and I quote - our “proud history of acting to strengthen good governance and the rule of law”.</p>

<p>One of the gravest affronts to everything we stand for is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</p>

<p>and Putin’s blockade of the ports that would otherwise be shipping food to the world’s poorest people.</p>

<p>At this moment, nearly 25 million tonnes of corn and wheat is piled up in silos across Ukraine, held hostage by Russia.</p>

<p>Britain supports the United Nations plan to get that food out</p>

<p>and we will invest over £370 million in global food security this year, including £130 million for the World Food Programme.</p>

<p>We want to work alongside our Commonwealth friends to understand your needs and priorities</p>

<p>and deliver joint solutions to a crisis that Putin has deliberately engineered.</p>

<p>For now, it only remains for me to thank every Commonwealth member for having given the United Kingdom the chance to serve as Chair-in-Office.</p>

<p>And as I pass on this responsibility to President Kagame,</p>

<p>a close friend and partner,</p>

<p>I know that he shares my boundless optimism</p>

<p>about the future of the Commonwealth at the forefront of the international agenda, and benefiting all our peoples.</p>

<p>Thank you all very much.</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
