<p>Following my statement to the House on 25 February 2022, I am updating the House on a short extension of the current Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>) funding settlement that was due to expire on 24 June 2022 by 19 days to 13 July. This has been agreed by the Mayor of London.</p>

<p>Since the start of the pandemic, we have supported the transport network in London with nearly £5 billion funding through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-for-london-settlement-letter">extraordinary funding settlements for Transport for London</a>. We have recognised the reliance of London’s transport network on fare revenue, and government continues our commitment to mitigating loss of fare revenue because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>This extension to the current funding settlement is necessary in part due to the unsatisfactory progress made by <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> on its conditions, including pensions. Resolving these issues is an integral part of setting <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> on the path to financial sustainability, and government stands ready to engage constructively to reach a resolution. This extension ensures that they receive due attention, as well as allowing time for both sides to consider a longer-term capital settlement.</p>

<p>Government is committed to supporting London’s transport network as we have since the start of the pandemic, and is in discussions with <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> on a longer-term settlement. By rolling over the provisions of the existing agreement, the extension provides continued support to <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> and certainty to Londoners while we work with <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> on its emergency funding needs.</p>

<p>Support to <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> has always been on the condition that <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> reaches financial sustainability as soon as possible and with a target date of April 2023 and government continues to press the Mayor of London and <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> to take the decisions needed to put the organisation on a sustainable footing. I will update the House at my earliest opportunity on the details of any longer-term capital settlement.</p>
