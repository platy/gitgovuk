<p>Mr Speaker, thank you and with permission, I will update the House on the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy.</p>

<p>Our Review will conclude early next year, setting out the UK’s international agenda,</p>

<p>but I want to inform the House of its first outcome.</p>

<p>For decades, British governments have trimmed and cheese-pared our defence budget</p>

<p>and if we go on like this,</p>

<p>we risk waking up to discover that our armed forces – the pride of Britain –</p>

<p>have fallen below the minimum threshold of viability,</p>

<p>and once lost, they could never be regained.</p>

<p>That outcome would not only be craven, it would jeopardise the security of the British people,</p>

<p>amounting to a dereliction of duty for any Prime Minister.</p>

<p>So I refused to vindicate any pessimistic forecasters there have been by taking up the scalpel yet again.</p>

<p>Based on our assessment of the international situation and our foreign policy goals,</p>

<p>I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end – and it ends now.</p>

<p>I am increasing defence spending by £24.1 billion over the next four years,</p>

<p>That’s £16.5 billion more than our manifesto commitment -</p>

<p>raising it as a share of GDP to at least 2.2 percent,</p>

<p>exceeding our NATO pledge,</p>

<p>and investing £190 billion over the next four years,</p>

<p>more than any other European country</p>

<p>and more than any other NATO ally, except the United States.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence has received a multi-year settlement because equipping our armed forces requires long term investment,</p>

<p>and our national security in 20 years’ time will depend on decisions we take today.</p>

<p>I have done this in the teeth of the pandemic, amid every other demand on our resources,</p>

<p>because the defence of the realm,</p>

<p>and the safety of the British people,</p>

<p>must come first.</p>

<p>I pay tribute to my Right Honourable Friends the Chancellor and Defence Secretary, who believe in this as fervently as I do.</p>

<p>Reviving our armed forces is one pillar of the Government’s ambition to safeguard Britain’s interests and values</p>

<p>by strengthening our global influence,</p>

<p>and reinforcing our ability to join the United States and our other allies to defend free and open societies.</p>

<p>The international situation is now more perilous and intensely competitive</p>

<p>than at any time since the Cold War.</p>

<p>Everything we do in this country – every job, every business, even how we shop and what we eat –</p>

<p>depends on a basic minimum of global security.</p>

<p>Our people are sustained by a web of lifelines, oxygen pipes that must be kept open</p>

<p>open shipping lanes, a functioning internet, safe air corridors, reliable undersea cables, and tranquillity in distant straits.</p>

<p>This pandemic has offered a taste of what happens when elemental requirements are suddenly in question.</p>

<p>We could take all this for granted, ignore the threat of terrorism and the ambitions of hostile states, and hope for the best,</p>

<p>and we might get away with it for a while, before calamity strikes, as it surely would.</p>

<p>Or we could accept that our lifelines must be protected, but we are content to curl up in our island and leave the task to our friends.</p>

<p>My starting point is that either of those options would be an abdication of the first duty of Government to defend our people.</p>

<p>My choice – and I hope it will carry every member of this House – is that Britain must be true to our history,</p>

<p>To stand alongside our allies, sharing the burden</p>

<p>and bringing our expertise to bear on the world’s toughest problems.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board.</p>

<p>We have already united our international effort into a new department combining aid and diplomacy,</p>

<p>Led with grit and purpose by my RH Friend the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Secretary.</p>

<p>Next year will be a year of British leadership, when we preside over the G7,</p>

<p>host COP-26 in Glasgow</p>

<p>and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first United Nations General Assembly in London.</p>

<p>We are leading the world towards net zero with our ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution,</p>

<p>and we are campaigning for our values, particularly freedom of religion and the media, and giving every girl in the world access to 12 years of quality education.</p>

<p>But extending British influence requires a once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces,</p>

<p>and now is the right time to press ahead</p>

<p>because emerging technologies, visible on the horizon,</p>

<p>will make the returns from defence investment infinitely greater.</p>

<p>We have a chance to break free from the vicious circle, whereby we ordered ever-decreasing numbers</p>

<p>of ever more expensive items of military hardware, squandering billions along the way.</p>

<p>The latest advances will multiply the fighting power of every warship, aircraft and infantry unit many times over,</p>

<p>and the prizes will go to the swiftest and most agile nations, not necessarily the biggest.</p>

<p>We can achieve as much as British ingenuity and expertise allow.</p>

<p>We will need to act speedily to remove or reduce less relevant capabilities – and this will allow our new investment to be focused on the technologies that will revolutionise warfare,</p>

<p>forging our military assets into a single network designed to overcome the enemy.</p>

<p>A soldier in hostile territory will be alerted to a distant ambush by sensors on satellites or drones,</p>

<p>instantly transmitting a warning,</p>

<p>using Artificial Intelligence to devise the optimal response,</p>

<p>and offering an array of options,</p>

<p>from summoning an air strike to ordering a swarm attack, by drones</p>

<p>or paralysing the enemy with cyber weapons.</p>

<p>New advances will surmount the old limits of logistics.</p>

<p>Our warships and combat vehicles will carry “directed energy weapons”, destroying targets with inexhaustible lasers</p>

<p>and for them the phrase “out of ammunition” will become redundant.</p>

<p>Nations are racing to master this new doctrine of warfare</p>

<p>and our investment is designed to place Britain among the winners.</p>

<p>The returns will go far beyond our Armed Forces.</p>

<p>From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications,</p>

<p>opening up new vistas of economic progress,</p>

<p>creating 10,000 jobs every year – 40,000 in total -</p>

<p>levelling up across our country</p>

<p>and reinforcing our Union.</p>

<p>We shall use our extra defence spending to restore Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe,</p>

<p>taking forward our plans for eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates,</p>

<p>and support ships to supply our carriers.</p>

<p>We are going to develop the next generation of warships,</p>

<p>including multi-role research vessels and Type 32 frigates.</p>

<p>And this will spur a renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK</p>

<p>– in Glasgow and Rosyth, Belfast, Appledore and Birkenhead –</p>

<p>guaranteeing jobs and illuminating the benefits of the Union in the white light of the arc welder’s torch.</p>

<p>If there was one policy which strengthens the UK in every possible sense, it is building more ships for the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>Once both of our carriers are operational in 2023, the UK will have a Carrier Strike Group permanently available,</p>

<p>routinely deployed globally and always ready to fight alongside NATO and other allies.</p>

<p>Next year HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades,</p>

<p>encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia.</p>

<p>We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation,</p>

<p>and we shall press on with renewing our nuclear deterrent.</p>

<p>We shall reshape our army for the age of networked warfare,</p>

<p>allowing better equipped soldiers to deploy more quickly,</p>

<p>and strengthening the ability of our Special Forces to operate covertly against our most sophisticated adversaries.</p>

<p>Our security and intelligence agencies will continue to protect us around the clock from terrorism and new and evolving threats,</p>

<p>We shall invest another £1.5 billion in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare,</p>

<p>and we will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence</p>

<p>and a new RAF Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022.</p>

<p>I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel,</p>

<p>which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity.</p>

<p>And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat.</p>

<p>Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry,</p>

<p>protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe.</p>

<p>The defence of the realm is above party politics</p>

<p>and we all take pride in how British resolve saved democracy in 1940,</p>

<p>and British internationalism – directed by Clement Attlee - helped to create NATO and preserve peace through the Cold War.</p>

<p>The wisdom and pragmatism of Margaret Thatcher found a path out of confrontation when she met Mikhail Gorbachev in 1984.</p>

<p>In each case, Britain tipped the scales of history and did immense good for the world.</p>

<p>Now we have a chance to follow in this great tradition,</p>

<p>to end the era of retreat,</p>

<p>transform our armed forces,</p>

<p>bolster our global influence,</p>

<p>unite and level up across our country,</p>

<p>protect our people,</p>

<p>and defend the free societies in which we fervently believe.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House.</p>
