<p>The UN Charter begins with the solemn invocation to peace:</p>

<p>“We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save successive generations from the scourge of war.”</p>

<p>That conviction has been the touchstone of the work in this Chamber since 1945.</p>

<p>We must not forget that our fundamental purpose here is to protect people and their futures.</p>

<p>To protect people from violence and conflict that destroys lives.</p>

<p>As we speak, women and children in Kyiv, young families in Odessa, pensioners in Kharkiv, and civilians all over Ukraine, are sheltering from Russia’s military onslaught.</p>

<p>First, Russia claimed this was all Western hysteria.</p>

<p>Then, they said it was about Donetsk and Luhansk.</p>

<p>Now, they are bombing Kyiv.</p>

<p>We have seen dreadful images of Russian tanks crushing civilians in the Ukrainian capital.</p>

<p>A country of 44 million people is being attacked on all fronts.</p>

<p>Colleagues,</p>

<p>The resolution we are voting on today is a message to those people: that the world is on your side and stands with the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p>It’s a message to the world: that the rules we built together must be defended. Because otherwise, who might be next?</p>

<p>It’s a message to Russia as well.</p>

<p>To the brave Russian citizens who are protesting a war they do not want.</p>

<p>This resolution demands an end to this war.</p>

<p>Colleagues,</p>

<p>President Putin has launched a massive invasion of Ukraine. His aim is to remove its government and subjugate its people.</p>

<p>No fog of war is thick enough to obscure a truth this clear.</p>

<p>This is not self-defence under Article 51.</p>

<p>It is naked aggression.</p>

<p>It is an unprovoked, unjustified war, and this Council must condemn it.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3>Remarks by Ambassador Barbara Woodward after the vote on the draft resolution:</h3>

<p>Colleagues,</p>

<p>A large majority of the Council has just voted in favour of a resolution aimed at stopping war.</p>

<p>The resolution has not been adopted only because of the single veto of the permanent member of this Council who is perpetrating that conflict.</p>

<p>Russia claims that its invasion of Ukraine is in self-defence. This is absurd.</p>

<p>Russia’s only act of self-defence is the vote they have cast against this resolution today.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: Russia is isolated.</p>

<p>It has no support for the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>History will record how we voted today and which countries stood up to be counted in defence of the Charter and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom stands steadfast in support of the Ukrainian people and will hold Russia accountable for its aggression.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
