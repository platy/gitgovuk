          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Over the past year we’ve come together many times to discuss climate change.</p>

<p>So you know by now how this conversation goes.</p>

<p>I talk about the need to rid the world of coal-fired power and internal combustion engines, the need to stop deforestation, and for developed nations to find that $100 billion.</p>

<p>I’ll stress that again – for this to be a success we need developed countries to find that $100 billion.</p>

<p>And everyone nods and we all agree that Something Must Be Done.</p>

<p>Yet I confess I’m increasingly frustrated that the “something” to which many of you have committed is nowhere near enough.</p>

<p>It is the biggest economies in the world that are causing the problem, while the smallest suffer the worst consequences.</p>

<p>And while progress is being made all over the world, the gulf between what has been promised, what is actually being delivered, and what needs to happen… it remains vast.</p>

<p>Too many major economies – some represented here today, some absent – are lagging too far behind.</p>

<p>And tinkering around the edges, simply denuding the tree of its lowest fruit, simply won’t achieve the change the planet needs.</p>

<p>I know it’s not easy.</p>

<p>We are all answerable to our voters, to our people.</p>

<p>And the questions being asked are pretty tough.</p>

<p>In the UK we’ve already cut our carbon emissions in half and we have all but eliminated coal from our energy mix.</p>

<p>Going further than that requires a whole extra level of effort – right now we’re grappling over how to get rid of gas-powered boilers, for example.</p>

<p>But remain committed to hitting net zero by 2050, with a huge chunk of the necessary cuts in emissions coming by 2030, by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>And as COP26 looms large I need to see, we all need to see, a similar level of ambition from the major economies represented here.</p>

<p>I’m not demanding that any nation forego the development achieved by the UK, or condemn its people to some kind of agrarian, pasteurised existence. 
  
Quite the opposite.</p>

<p>I want to see you leapfrogging the outdated methods of yesteryear in favour of the cheaper, cleaner, cutting-edge technology that will power the 21st century.</p>

<p>Wind and solar are the cheapest form of electricity generation in two-thirds of the world.</p>

<p>By 2030 renewables will be undercutting coal and gas almost everywhere. 
  
So going green isn’t just better for the planet. 
  
It means greater prosperity for your people.</p>

<p>It means more opportunities for your businesses.</p>

<p>And it puts you on the right side of public opinion both at home and on the international stage.</p>

<p>Because climate change is no longer an issue that solely concerns the unkempt fringes.</p>

<p>Climate change IS realpolitik.</p>

<p>It’s a diplomacy issue, a security issue, a trade issue.</p>

<p>And in the years to come, the only great powers will be green powers.</p>

<p>We are joined today by leaders of countries already feeling the worst effects of climate change.</p>

<p>As the world continues to warm they will be joined in that unfortunate distinction by still more nations, home to billions of people, and an ever-growing slice of global GDP.</p>

<p>And if you abdicate responsibility today, do you think those who pay the price for that decision will rally to your side tomorrow?</p>

<p>If you say that the lives of their children are not worth the hassle of reducing domestic coal consumption, will they vote with you in fora such as this?</p>

<p>Will they work with you, borrow from you, stand with you if you tell the world that you don’t care whether their land and their people slip below the waves?</p>

<p>These countries need allies.</p>

<p>They need help now, that’s why I stress the $100 billion so much.</p>

<p>To be merely a bystander is to be complicit in their fate – yet that is exactly what you will be if you fail to act this year.</p>

<p>I speak frankly – we are, after all, among friends.</p>

<p>But COP26 will be staged in the full glare of the global spotlight.</p>

<p>And when the summit ends, when most of the world has committed to decisive, game-changing action, it will be clear to all which of us has lacked the courage to step up.</p>

<p>The world will see, and your people will remember, and history will judge.</p>

<p>So you can look away, you can do the minimum, you can hope that if you feed the crocodile enough it will devour you last.</p>

<p>Or you can show leadership.</p>

<p>You can make the choices that will make you country stronger and your people richer.</p>

<p>You can make the promises we need and follow through with the action that will give them form. </p>

<p>And together we can make COP26 the success the world needs it to be.</p>
