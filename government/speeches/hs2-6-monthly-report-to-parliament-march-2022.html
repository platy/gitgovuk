<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is my fourth update to Parliament on High Speed Two (<abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>).</p>

<p>I can confirm that the project remains within budget and schedule in delivering Phase One (London – West Midlands) and Phase 2a (West Midlands – Crewe), we have hit major construction milestones, made substantial progress on key procurements and made significant progress to take <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> further north. Work is also already underway to implement the proposals set out in the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-rail-plan-for-the-north-and-the-midlands">Integrated Rail Plan (<abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr>) for the North and Midlands</a>, for example with the recent introduction of a Bill into Parliament to build <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> between Crewe and Manchester.</p>

<p>Key achievements in this reporting period (September 2021 to January 2022) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> is now supporting over 22,000 jobs.</li>

The <abbr title="Design and Delivery Partner">DDP</abbr> will act as a strategic partner for <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd to drive efficient design and construction in extending the railway to Crewe.</li>
  <li>A decision has been taken to support greater integration between the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> and Network Rail stations at Euston. This has potential to deliver construction efficiencies, along with significant passenger and place-making benefits at Euston and the surrounding area.</li>
  <li>I am delighted to confirm that we are expanding Sir Jon Thompson’s role, an existing non-executive director on the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd Board, to become Deputy Chair. Sir Jon will chair meetings of the board until a permanent Chair is in post.</li>
</ul>

<p>This report primarily uses data provided by <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd to the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ministerial Task Force for Phases One and 2a and covers the period between September 2021 and January 2022 inclusive. Unless stated, all figures are presented in 2019 prices.</p>

<h2>Programme update</h2>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<p>On Phase One (London – West Midlands), the forecast for initial services from Old Oak Common to Birmingham remains within the delivery into service (<abbr title="Delivery into Service">DiS</abbr>) range of 2029 to 2033. The revised schedule agreed last year has held to date with local delays being largely mitigated.</p>

<p>Over the reporting period, good progress has been made on closing out the majority of enabling works, with the remaining work due to be completed by early next year. Good progress has also been made on tunnelling activities. Additionally, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd has advanced its earthworks. Maintaining construction progress depends on the detailed design and consents needed to support a further very significant increase in civil works on earthworks and structures in 2022.</p>

<p>The main areas of schedule focus remain in the southern section of the line-of-route and tunnels leading into Old Oak Common Station from outer London, which form the critical path for initial services. Any delays in these sectors could delay the whole project. Other key watch areas include Bromford Tunnel, Birmingham Curzon Street Station and the route into Birmingham where the urban environment generates significant logistical challenges.</p>

<p>Phase 2a remains on track to be delivered between 2030 and 2034. Land possessions have commenced and enabling works started in early 2022.</p>

<p>As confirmed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-crewe-to-manchester-update-on-the-strategic-outline-business-case">update on the Phase 2b Western Leg (Crewe to Manchester) strategic outline business case</a> (<abbr title="strategic outline business case">SOBC</abbr>) in January 2022, the department has set a schedule range of 2035 to 2041 for the opening of the Phase 2b Western Leg.</p>

<h3>Affordability</h3>

<p><abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> remains within budget. The overall budget for Phase One remains £44.6 billion. This is composed of the target cost of £40.3 billion and additional government-retained contingency of £4.3 billion. The target cost includes contingency delegated to <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd of £5.6 billion for managing risk and uncertainties.</p>

<p>To date, out of the Phase One target cost of £40.3 billion, £14.9 billion has been spent, with an additional £0.8 billion for land and property provisions. £12.7 billion has been contracted and has not been spent, with the remaining amount not yet under contract.</p>

<p><abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd has drawn £1.3 billion of its £5.6 billion delegated contingency, meaning £4.3 billion remains. Contingency drawn to date reflects an increase of £0.5 billion since my last update (from £0.8 billion to £1.3 billion).</p>

<p><abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s is reporting £1.7 billion of potential future cost pressures that are currently presenting across the programme. This reflects an increase in potential further cost pressures of £0.4 billion since my last update (from £1.3 billion to £1.7 billion).</p>

<p>Since my last report, the aggregate increase in actual and potential additional costs is therefore £0.9 billion (£0.5 billion from increase in contingency drawdown plus £0.4 billion from potential further cost pressures). Whilst these pressures are manageable within the target cost given the remaining contingency, I am nonetheless concerned at the rate of their increase. I expect <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd to maintain its focus on delivery to the target cost.</p>

<p>Should these or other cost pressures materialise, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd will continue to draw from the contingency it holds, of which £4.3 billion remains (as outlined above). Out of the £1.7 billion of net potential pressures currently being reported by <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd in its January 2022 data, over and above the contingency drawn down so far, the key pressures are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An estimate of £0.8 billion (increase of £0.2 billion from my last update) for potential additional main works civils costs stemming from additional design costs and slower than expected progress in some areas.</li>
  <li>A pressure of £0.4 billion on the cost estimate for the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Euston station. The move to a smaller, less complex 10-platform single-stage delivery strategy at Euston, as confirmed in my previous report, is now the basis for ongoing design work and other activities. The department anticipates that this will assist in addressing the cost pressure at Euston, as the updated station design is developed over the coming months. This work will also consider and address the appropriate level of contingency that should be held to managing risks that are likely to arise during the construction of an asset of this complexity. The department will provide further updates as this work progresses over the course of the next 18 months.</li>
  <li>A pressure of £0.2 billion against <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s budget for changes to Network Rail infrastructure at Euston and Old Oak Common that are required to facilitate the new <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> stations.</li>
  <li>There is a further £0.3 billion of net cost pressures presenting on other parts of the programme. This is the aggregate total of smaller potential cost pressures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over £0.8 billion in savings and efficiencies from across the programme (increase of £0.5 billion from my last update) have been identified against <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s budget, principally from awarding the rolling stock contract under budget, contracting a common supplier for lifts and escalators, and savings in the acquisition of land and property. These have partly offset gross cost pressures. <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd continues to focus on realising further efficiencies and opportunities to reduce the costs of Phase One.</p>

<p>On COVID-19 costs, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s assessment of the likely financial impact of the pandemic on delivering Phase One remains estimated within the range of £0.4 billion to £0.7 billion. Formal claims will be subject to government scrutiny and will require formal approval from Her Majesty’s Treasury before funds from government-retained contingency can be allocated.</p>

<p>For Phase 2a, the overall cost range is £5.2 billion to £7.2 billion. We intend to set a target cost alongside publication of the full business case next year.</p>

<p>As confirmed in the update on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-crewe-to-manchester-update-on-the-strategic-outline-business-case">update on the Phase 2b (Crewe to Manchester) <abbr title="strategic outline business case">SOBC</abbr></a>, the estimated cost range for the Crewe to Manchester scheme is £15 billion to £22 billion. It is project delivery best practice to set a range and to narrow this down over time.</p>

<p>Lastly, the department and <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd are currently working to assess and mitigate the impact of global inflationary pressure on materials and labour supply on the programme where short-term increases are being seen. This is likely caused in part by the recovery of global construction demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>Delivery</h3>

<p>On Phase One, delivery continues to build momentum at 340 sites. Tunnel drives are underway at 2 sites. In the Chilterns, tunnel boring machines (<abbr title="tunnel boring machines">TBMs</abbr>) ‘Florence’ and ‘Cecilia’ have been making good progress and have currently tunnelled a combined distance of approximately 3.5 miles. In December 2021, we saw the launch of ‘Dorothy’ (the first <abbr title="tunnel boring machine">TBM</abbr> in the Midlands) which will preserve the Long Itchington Wood in Warwickshire. The tunnelling team will operate the machine for around 5 months as it excavates the first bore of the one-mile tunnel. This will be the first <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> tunnel to be completed on the project, with the machine set to break through its first bore at the south portal later this spring when it will return to the start to begin the second parallel tunnel.</p>

<p>At Old Oak Common Station, significant progress has been made in constructing the 750,000 metres-cubed box structure that will facilitate the 6 subterranean high-speed line platforms, as well as the works required to facilitate the start of tunnel boring to Euston in the east and Northolt in the west. Work is underway with the Old Oak Common and Park Royal Development Corporation, the London Mayor and the Department for Levelling Up, Homes and Communities to bring forward proposals for the regeneration of the area around the station.</p>

<p>In the West Midlands, stage one of the 2-stage design and build contract for Birmingham Curzon Street Station will conclude shortly subject to agreement of an affordable target price. A solution for co-construction of the West Midlands Metro tram extension whilst delivering the station has been agreed with Transport for the West Midlands so that benefits of both projects can be brought to Birmingham as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>In September 2021, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd launched the process to appoint a design and build contractor to complete Interchange Station in Solihull. Contract award remains on schedule for summer 2022. Central and local government are also working with the private sector to bring forward proposals to release land for development. This would enable approximately 350 acres of land to support the Arden Cross Masterplan, creating a space for innovation, business, learning and living, providing up to 27,000 new jobs and 3,000 new homes and is backed by conditional government funding of £50 million.</p>

<p>A decision has been taken to proceed with greater integration between the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> and Network Rail stations at Euston. The department and Network Rail are developing the business case for the redevelopment of the Network Rail station concourse at Euston in parallel with the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> build, which will support greater integration between the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> and Network Rail stations. <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd and Network Rail, with support from The Euston Partnership, are working together to develop a cost-effective design that provides integration between the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> station and the redevelopment of the Network Rail station and delivers value for money for the taxpayer. This integrated approach has potential to deliver construction efficiencies, along with significant passenger and place-making benefits at Euston.</p>

<p>I am delighted to confirm that we reached a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-awards-hs2-rolling-stock-contract">major milestone</a> on the procurement of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> trains. In December, an Alstom/Hitachi joint venture was awarded the £2 billion <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> rolling stock contract for Phases One and 2a and is expected to support around 2,500 jobs across the UK. This contract includes the design and build of 54 new high-speed trains and an initial 12-year maintenance period. The trains will be manufactured in Newton Aycliffe, Derby and Crewe and then maintained at the new depot in Washwood Heath, Birmingham. The second-placed bidder, Siemens, continues to challenge the procurement decision legally but has not sought to impede the award and delivery of the rolling stock contract.</p>

<p><abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd continues tendering for Phase One and 2a rail systems packages (including track, catenary, mechanical and electrical fitout, power, control and communications). Over the coming months, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd will request bidders to submit their final price and I anticipate that we will begin awarding these packages in early 2023. In the next 6 months, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd will further develop their approach to integration of these rail systems packages. This will include testing operational processes and systems, development of its leadership capability and standing up of interim governance arrangements.</p>

<p>On Phase 2a (West Midlands – Crewe), <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd has invited tenders for a design and delivery partner (<abbr title="Design and Delivery Partner">DDP</abbr>) in January 2022. Additionally, the start of procurement for the main works civils framework is expected to commence later this year which will provide the construction capacity to be managed by the <abbr title="Design and Delivery Partner">DDP</abbr>. Early environmental works and early civils works have also begun.</p>

<h3>Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands</h3>

<p>The government has published its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/integrated-rail-plan-for-the-north-and-the-midlands">Integrated Rail Plan (<abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr>) for the North and Midlands</a>. It sets a £96 billion strategy of rail construction and upgrades for the North and Midlands to be delivered over the next 30 years. Work is also already underway to implement the proposals set out in the <abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>For example, £249 million was invested to further electrify the Midland Main Line between Kettering and Market Harborough with work started at Christmas 2021. The <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Phase 2b Crewe – Manchester scheme sits at the core of the <abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr>, bringing high-speed rail to Manchester and providing vital infrastructure necessary to deliver the Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) scheme. On 24 January 2022, the government introduced the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hs2-phase-2b-high-speed-rail-crewe-manchester-bill-2022">High Speed Rail (Crewe – Manchester) Bill</a> to secure the powers to construct and maintain the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Phase 2b Western Leg. Once approved, the railway will be critical to generating transformational economic change in the North West of England. Once the Crewe to Manchester section of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> opens, the railway will reduce travel times from 2 hours 5 minutes to around 1 hour 10 minutes from London to Manchester. The introduction of the bill into Parliament was accompanied by an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-phase-2b-crewe-manchester-environmental-impact">Environmental Statement</a> and an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-crewe-to-manchester-update-on-the-strategic-outline-business-case">update on the 2017 <abbr title="strategic outline business case">SOBC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr> also confirmed the government’s intention to take forward <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> East, a new high-speed line between West Midlands and to East Midlands Parkway, enabling <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> to serve Nottingham and Derby city centres. In conjunction with plans for the electrification of the Midland Main Line, this will also allow <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> trains to continue direct to Chesterfield and Sheffield. Following a pause to design work on the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Eastern Leg as a result of the Oakervee Review, the department and <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd are considering how best to take forward this new West to East Midlands high-speed line working closely with Network Rail. The <abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr> provides £100 million to look at the most effective way to run <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> trains to Leeds, including understanding the most optimal solution for Leeds station capacity and starting work on the new West Yorkshire Mass Transit System.</p>

<h3>Local community impact and engagement</h3>

<p>As <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Minister, I expect affected communities to be at the heart of our plans for this project. I am therefore pleased that <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s refreshed community engagement strategy (‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1028421/HS2_Community_Engagement_Strategy_-_Respecting_people__respecting_places__October_2021.pdf" rel="external">Respecting people, Respecting places</a>’) has this vision at its core and sets out <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s renewed commitments to the communities impacted by the programme.</p>

<p>One of the ways that the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> project counterbalances some of its negative impacts on places is through the Community and Environment Fund and the Business and Local Economy Fund. These funds have now supported 192 projects through £11.1 million of grant funding along the line-of-route and play a crucial role in ensuring a positive legacy for communities most affected by construction.</p>

<p><abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd has also recently launched several initiatives to continue actively engaging communities affected by <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>. For example, ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hs2.org.uk/in-your-area/map/#7/52.4530/-1.4880/filter=hs2-stations,hs2-network" rel="external">In your area</a>’ is an interactive map which informs people of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> works in their area. Furthermore, independent construction inspectors continue to support the assurance of the delivery of works. Where problems do arise, the Construction Commissioner provides a means of escalation and independent consideration. I am pleased to report that the existing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hs2-independent-construction-commissioner">Construction Commissioner</a>, Sir Mark Worthington <abbr title="officer of the order of the british empire">OBE</abbr>, has been reappointed for a further 3 years. Additionally, I am currently recruiting a replacement for the outgoing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hs2-ltd-residents-commissioner">Residents’ Commissioner</a>, Deborah Fazan.</p>

<p>Targeted protester activity continues to have some impact on Phase One delivery. However, following successful removal of the unlawful protester site at Small Dean near Wendover in October and November 2021, protest impact on Phase One has now been reduced significantly. <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd estimates that ongoing protester activity, including the removal of encampments and protest-related delays to the programme, has cost just under £122 million, an increase of £42 million since my last report. <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd continues to work with its supply chain, local police forces and wider government to minimise the impact of unlawful protester activity.</p>

<h2>Land and property</h2>

<p>I am pleased to announce that the 5 years of compulsory purchase powers on Phase One provided by the Phase One Act ended on 23 February 2022 with the serving of all planned notices by the deadline set by Parliament. While work to complete the land acquisition and, crucially, settle compensation for affected property owners will continue, this is an important milestone for the programme.</p>

<p>Significant progress has also been made to implement the proposals set out in my 2020 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-land-and-property-review-2020">Land and Property Review</a>: three-quarters of the proposals have now been implemented. The response to our recent public <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/2021-hs2-land-and-property-review-proposals-public-consultation/2021-hs2-land-and-property-review-proposals-public-consultation">Land and property consultation</a> was also published in February 2022.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>In January, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd published its ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.hs2.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/25357_HS2_VisionStatement_CS1655_Final_InteractiveWeb.pdf" rel="external">Environmental Sustainability Vision</a>’ which reaffirmed its commitment to provide low carbon rail travel for a cleaner, greener future.</p>

<p>I was delighted to confirm, as part of that vision, that <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> trains will use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mediacentre.hs2.org.uk/news/hs2-to-be-powered-by-zero-carbon-energy-from-day-one" rel="external">zero carbon energy</a> from day one of operation. This will support <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s target to achieve net zero in construction and operation from 2035. The commitment is a key part of the new <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.hs2.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/25357_HS2_NetZeroCarbonPlan_CS1656_Final_InteractiveWeb.pdf" rel="external">Net Zero Carbon Plan</a>’ which sets out a suite of ambitious new targets to reduce the carbon footprint of the programme.</p>

<p>The vision confirmed that <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd will seek to deliver a 10% net gain in biodiversity for replaceable habitats on the Phase 2b Crewe – Manchester scheme. I also intend to explore going beyond the existing no-net-loss of biodiversity target for Phase One and Phase 2a, to secure biodiversity gains where this is cost-effective and possible within existing funding limits.</p>

<p>Lastly, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd published its first ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1045431/25091_HS2_EnvironmentalSustainabilityProgressReport20-21_CS1547_Final_InteractiveWeb.pdf" rel="external">Environmental Sustainability Progress Report</a>’ in January. This provides a clear and up-to-date account of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>’s environmental impacts and the progress being made to mitigate any adverse effects.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>I am delighted to announce that <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> is supporting over 22,000 jobs and to date over 2,400 UK-registered companies have delivered work on <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>. To date, there have been 1,674 jobs starts by people who were previously workless. The programme will create 2,000 apprenticeships, with 825 having been started since 2017.</p>

<p>In November 2021, <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s construction partner Balfour Beatty VINCI opened a new ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://mediacentre.hs2.org.uk/news/new-balfour-beatty-vinci-training-academy-to-upskill-local-people-ready-for-work-on-hs2#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Skills%20Academy%20will%20help,economic%20recovery%20from%20the%20pandemic.%E2%80%9D" rel="external">Skills Academy</a>’ in the West Midlands in partnership with South and City College of Birmingham.</p>

<p>As stated in the government’s ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom">Levelling Up</a>’ white paper, this year, the government will publish a <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Local Growth Action Plan, setting out how it will work with places hosting Phase One and 2a stations to realise their local growth ambitions. The new railway will stimulate growth around <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> stations and further afield, helping to level up the economies of the Midlands and North.</p>

<p>Promoting active travel along the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> route and at stations is also a key priority for me. To ensure that opportunities for lasting legacy improvements are realised, I have asked <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd to explore the potential for the re-purposing of temporary construction routes, into new vehicle-free connections between rural communities that could connect other emerging local authority cycle proposals to provide a wider active travel network along the spine of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>. This will not only benefit the environment, but also improve the health and wellbeing of residents and commuters. In addition, I have asked <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd to upgrade active travel provisions at 12 locations across Phase One.</p>

<h2>Programme governance</h2>

<p>An updated <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd framework document and <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> development agreement will be concluded shortly to continue effective governance between the department and <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd. Furthermore, we have relaunched the search for a new Chair with updated role criteria to appeal to a wider set of candidates. In parallel, we are expanding Sir Jon Thompson’s role, an existing non-executive director on the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd Board, to become Deputy Chair. Sir Jon will chair meetings of the board until a permanent Chair is in post.</p>

<p>Lastly, as committed to in my previous update, all recommendations from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/7381/documents/77661/default/" rel="external">Public Accounts Committee (<abbr title="Public Accounts Committee">PAC</abbr>) report</a> of 22 September 2021 have now been implemented.</p>

<h2>Forward look</h2>

<p>On Phase One, over the next 6 months we will continue the ramp-up of construction work, launch the fourth <abbr title="tunnel boring machine">TBM</abbr> on the programme to start excavation of the London tunnels and we will see <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd award a contract for the construction of Interchange Station.</p>

<p>On Phase 2a, focus will be on progressing environmental and enabling work, early land acquisitions plus the procurement for the <abbr title="Design and Delivery Partner">DDP</abbr> and progressing the procurement for the main works civils framework.</p>

<p>On Phase 2b, following the introduction of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hs2-phase-2b-high-speed-rail-crewe-manchester-bill-2022">High Speed Rail (Crewe – Manchester) Bill</a> into Parliament, the Environmental Statement consultation is now underway, which will close on 31 March 2022. The priority for <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> East is to develop the next stage of design work for the West to East Midlands high-speed line.</p>

<p>I will continue to engage closely with Parliament and will provide my next update in autumn 2022.</p>

<p>[5] Spend to date stated above for Phase One includes a £0.8 billion liability (provision) representing the department’s obligation to purchase land and property.</p>

<p>[6] The government is proceeding with <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> East (the new high-speed line between the West and East Midlands) and is providing £100 million to look at the most effective way to run <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> trains to Leeds, including understanding the most optimal solution for Leeds station capacity, and starting work on the new West Yorkshire Mass Transit System. As at the end of January 2022, £0.48 billion (rounded in actual prices) had been spent developing the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Eastern Leg to Leeds, including workforce. A substantial proportion of this has been spent on <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> East (the West to East Midlands section of the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Eastern Leg), which is proceeding as confirmed in the <abbr title="Integrated Rail Plan">IRP</abbr>. A further £0.15 billion (rounded in actual prices) has been spent on land and property along the full <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Eastern Leg to Leeds, and again a substantial proportion of that land and property spend is along the section between the West and East Midlands. Any land or property not ultimately required for the railway will be resold, enabling us to recover costs.</p>
