<p>Our roadmap to freedom depends on the continued success of our vaccination programme,</p>

<p>and so it is reasonable for people to want to be continually reassured</p>

<p>not only that our vaccines are safe and effective</p>

<p>but also that we have the supply that we need.</p>

<p>So I want to address both points today</p>

<p>especially in the light of concerns you may have heard in some other countries about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>

<p>First, the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has reviewed the evidence, as it does every week.</p>

<p>They have confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID far outweigh any risks</p>

<p>and people should continue to get their vaccine when asked to do so</p>

<p>and June will say a little bit more about that in a moment.</p>

<p>It’s also very important for our European friends that today the European Medicines Agency has come to a clear scientific conclusion</p>

<p>and I quote -</p>

<p>“this is a safe and effective vaccine.”</p>

<p>We also saw yesterday the evidence from Public Health England</p>

<p>that a single dose of either vaccine provides 60 per cent protection against getting COVID.</p>

<p>and reduces the chances of hospitalisation by 80 per cent</p>

<p>and the risk of death by 85 per cent.</p>

<p>So the Oxford jab is safe; and the Pfizer jab is safe – the thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid – which is why it’s so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes.</p>

<p>And as it happens, I’m getting mine tomorrow.</p>

<p>And the centre where I’m getting jabbed is currently using the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for those receiving their first dose, and that is the one I’ll be having.</p>

<p>And let me also assure you –</p>

<p>if you come forwards after receiving your letter, we have the jabs for you.</p>

<p>We’ve always said that in a vaccination programme of this pace and this scale, some interruptions in supply are inevitable</p>

<p>and it is true that in the short term we are receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago.</p>

<p>That is because of a delay in a shipment from the Serum Institute</p>

<p>who are doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities -</p>

<p>and because of a batch that we currently have in the UK that needs to be retested – as part of our rigorous safety programmes.</p>

<p>So as a result we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March.</p>

<p>But that is still more than we received in February</p>

<p>and the supply we do have will still enable us to hit the targets we have set.</p>

<p>That means that by 15 April we will be able to offer a first dose to all of you who are over 50, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable.</p>

<p>We will have the second doses that people need within the 12 week window – which means around        12 million people in April.</p>

<p>And we will still offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July.</p>

<p>So there is no change to the next steps of the roadmap.</p>

<p>We’ve now vaccinated over 25 million across our entire United Kingdom – more than the entire population of many countries</p>

<p>and our progress along the road to freedom continues unchecked.</p>

<p>We remain on track to reclaim the things we love,</p>

<p>to see our families and friends again,</p>

<p>to return to our local pubs, our gyms and sports facilities, and of course our shops,</p>

<p>all as long as the data continue to go in the right direction and we meet our four tests.</p>

<p>And the way to ensure this happens is to get that jab when your turn comes.</p>

<p>So let’s get the jab done!</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
