<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmPXGkixiYY" rel="external">Prime Minister Liz Truss’s statement on the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</a></p>

<p>We are all devastated by the news we have just heard from Balmoral.</p>

<p>The death of Her Majesty The Queen is a huge shock to the nation and to the world.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built.</p>

<p>Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.</p>

<p>Britain is the great country it is today because of her.</p>

<p>She ascended the throne just after the Second World War.</p>

<p>She championed the development of the Commonwealth - from a small group of seven countries to a family of 56 nations spanning every continent of the world.</p>

<p>We are now a modern, thriving, dynamic nation.</p>

<p>Through thick and thin, Queen Elizabeth II provided us with the stability and the strength that we needed.</p>

<p>She was the very spirit of Great Britain – and that spirit will endure.</p>

<p>She has been our longest-ever reigning monarch.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary achievement to have presided with such dignity and grace for 70 years.</p>

<p>Her life of service stretched beyond most of our living memories.</p>

<p>In return, she was loved and admired by the people in the United Kingdom and all around the world.</p>

<p>She has been a personal inspiration to me and to many Britons. Her devotion to duty is an example to us all.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, at 96, she remained determined to carry out her duties as she appointed me as her 15th Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Throughout her life she has visited more than 100 countries and she has touched the lives of millions around the world.</p>

<p>In the difficult days ahead, we will come together with our friends…</p>

<p>….across the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the world…</p>

<p>…to celebrate her extraordinary lifetime of service.</p>

<p>It is a day of great loss, but Queen Elizabeth II leaves a great legacy.</p>

<p>Today the Crown passes - as it is has done for more than a thousand years - to our new monarch, our new head of state:</p>

<p>His Majesty King Charles III.</p>

<p>With the King’s family, we mourn the loss of his mother.</p>

<p>And as we mourn, we must come together as a people to support him.</p>

<p>To help him bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all.</p>

<p>We offer him our loyalty and devotion just as his mother devoted so much to so many for so long.</p>

<p>And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country,</p>

<p>– exactly as Her Majesty would have wished –</p>

<p>by saying the words…</p>

<p>God save the King.</p>
