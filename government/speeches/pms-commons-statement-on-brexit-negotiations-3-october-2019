<p>With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the government’s proposals for a new agreement with our European friends</p>

<p>that would honour the result of the referendum and deliver Brexit on 31st October - in an orderly way with a deal.</p>

<p>This government’s objective has always been to leave with a deal. And these constructive and reasonable proposals show our seriousness of purpose.</p>

<p>They do not deliver everything that we would have wished. They do represent a compromise.</p>

<p>But to remain a prisoner of existing positions is to become a cause of deadlock rather than breakthrough.</p>

<p>And so we have made a genuine attempt to bridge the chasm, to reconcile the apparently irreconcilable. And to go the extra mile as time runs short.</p>

<p>Our starting point is that this House promised to respect the referendum before the vote. More people voted Leave than voted for any political party in our history.</p>

<p>This referendum must be respected.</p>

<p>Both main parties promised at the 2017 election that they would respect the referendum and there would be no second referendum.</p>

<p>This House voted to trigger Article 50 and has voted repeatedly to leave.</p>

<p>Yet it also voted three times against the previous Withdrawal Agreement and for repeated delay.</p>

<p>And so, as I have emphasised time and again, there can be no path to a deal except by reopening the Withdrawal Agreement and replacing the so-called backstop.</p>

<p>While, as I stand here today, we are some way from a resolution, it is to the credit of our European friends that they have accepted the need to address these issues.</p>

<p>And I welcome the constructive calls I have had over the last twenty-four hours</p>

<p>including with President Juncker, Chancellor Merkel, Taoiseach Varadkar</p>

<p>and the statement from President Juncker that the Commission will now examine the legal text objectively.</p>

<p>The essence of our new proposal is a new Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland consisting of five elements.</p>

<p>In the first place all our actions are based on our shared determination to sustain the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, the fundamental basis of governance in Northern Ireland</p>

<p>the protection of which is the highest priority of all.</p>

<p>And from this follows the second principle – namely that we shall of course uphold all the longstanding areas of co-operation between the UK and our friends in Ireland</p>

<p>including the rights of all those living in Northern Ireland, North/South co-operation</p>

<p>and the Common Travel Area, which predates both the Good Friday Agreement and the European Union itself.</p>

<p>Third, we propose the potential creation of a regulatory zone on the island of Ireland covering all goods, including agri-food.</p>

<p>For as long as it exists, this zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>But fourth, unlike the so-called backstop, such a regulatory zone would be sustained with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, as expressed through the Assembly and Executive.</p>

<p>They will give their consent during the transition period as a condition for these arrangements entering into force.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the Assembly will vote again every four years - and if consent were withheld, these arrangements would then lapse after one year.</p>

<p>Fifth, it has always been a point of principle for this government that at the end of the transition period, the UK should leave the EU Customs Union whole and entire</p>

<p>restoring sovereign control over our trade policy and opening the way for free trade deals with all our friends around the world.</p>

<p>That is a fundamental point for us, Mr Speaker.</p>

<p>So, under the proposals in this new Protocol, Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory not the EU Customs Union.</p>

<p>But there will be no need for checks – or any infrastructure – at or near the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Indeed, I have already given a guarantee that the UK government will never conduct checks at the border</p>

<p>and we believe that the EU should do the same, so there is absolute clarity on that point.</p>

<p>Instead under this new Protocol all customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland would take place either electronically</p>

<p>or in the small number of cases where physical checks would be necessary, they would happen at traders’ premises or other points in the supply chain.</p>

<p>We have put forward a method for achieving this</p>

<p>based on improving and simplifying existing rules, trusting certain traders and strengthening our co-operation with Ireland</p>

<p>in a spirit of friendship and sensitivity to the particular circumstances.</p>

<p>So while these proposals will mean changes from the situation that prevails today in Ireland and Northern Ireland</p>

<p>it is their driving purpose to minimise any disruption.</p>

<p>And in order to support the transition further we propose a New Deal for Northern Ireland</p>

<p>that will boost economic growth and competitiveness</p>

<p>and set in train new infrastructure, particularly with a cross-border focus.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, the previous Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration would have permanently anchored the United Kingdom within the orbit of EU regulation and customs arrangements.</p>

<p>And an indefinite so-called backstop provided a bridge to that vision of the future.</p>

<p>This Government has a different vision – basing our future relationship with our European neighbours on a Free Trade Agreement</p>

<p>and allowing the UK to take back control of our trade policy and our regulations.</p>

<p>And we propose to amend the Political Declaration to reflect this ambition.</p>

<p>Our proposals should now provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution in the short time that remains.</p>

<p>I do not for one moment resile from the fact that we have shown great flexibility in the interests of reaching an accommodation with our European friends</p>

<p>and achieving the resolution for which we all yearn.</p>

<p>If our European neighbours choose not to show a corresponding willingness to reach a deal</p>

<p>then we shall have to leave on 31st October without an agreement</p>

<p>and we are ready to do so.</p>

<p>But that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which all parties would be held responsible.</p>

<p>When I think of the conflicts that have wracked Europe in the past</p>

<p>of the immense challenges that we have together surmounted</p>

<p>of the 74 years of peace and prosperity we have together achieved</p>

<p>I believe that surely we can summon the collective will to reach a new agreement.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, this government has moved</p>

<p>our proposals do represent a compromise</p>

<p>and I hope the House can now come together in the national interest</p>

<p>behind this new deal.</p>

<p>To open a new chapter of friendship with our European neighbours</p>

<p>and move on to our domestic priorities – including education, infrastructure and our NHS.</p>

<p>So Mr Speaker, let us seize this moment</p>

<p>to honour our over-riding promise to the British people</p>

<p>respect Brexit</p>

<p>and get Brexit done</p>

<p>and I commend this Statement to the House.</p>
