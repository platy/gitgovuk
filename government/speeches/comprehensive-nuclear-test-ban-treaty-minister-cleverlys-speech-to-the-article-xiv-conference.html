<p>Co-Presidents and colleagues, I am honoured to represent the UK, and I thank Italy and South Africa for bringing us together today.</p>

<p>The UK would like to reaffirm its strong support for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and for the organisation that underpins it.</p>

<p>We welcome this opportunity to garner support for the Treaty’s entry-into-force, which we have advocated for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Our goal is very simple: to bring an end to nuclear weapon test explosions, anywhere on the planet.</p>

<p>Each signature and ratification takes us closer to this goal.</p>

<p>I therefore welcome the ratifications by Cuba and the Union of the Comoros since the last Conference, and I call on the remaining Annex 2 States to sign or ratify the Treaty.</p>

<p>The UK condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s continued development of illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p>

<p>We call for the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea.</p>

<p>I know I speak for many of us when I urge the country to resume dialogue with the international community.</p>

<p>We call on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.</p>

<p>Though entry-into-force has not yet become a reality, we should be clear how much the Treaty Organisation delivers.</p>

<p>It makes it extremely difficult for would-be proliferators.</p>

<p>And with a verification regime now over 90% complete, it not only detects explosions, but also natural disasters.</p>

<p>It contributes to tsunami early-warning detection, and measures the impact of climate change.</p>

<p>I congratulate Dr Robert Floyd on his recent appointment as Executive Secretary of the CTBTO.</p>

<p>We look forward to working with you, to progress entry-into-force, and strengthen the verification system, as the Treaty turns twenty-five.</p>

<p>We will raise those benefits at the NPT Review Conference when that is able to proceed.</p>

<p>The UK is an enthusiastic participant in all of the Organisation’s work.</p>

<p>We are a vocal campaigner in multilateral forums, and one of the largest contributors, providing £4.5 million annually.</p>

<p>We give technical and political support to the Preparatory Commission, and host thirteen facilities that support the International Monitoring System.</p>

<p>Co-Presidents, I conclude by welcoming the assessed contributions. I urge States yet to pay, to do so.</p>

<p>It is our collective responsibility to sustain the Organisation and promote the Treaty’s entry-into-force, as a step towards our shared goal, of a world without nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
