<p>As soon as we learned of the new Omicron variant,</p>

<p>this government acted</p>

<p>introducing targeted and proportionate measures as a precaution, whilst our scientists discovered more.</p>

<p>And we’re learning more every day.</p>

<p>We do not yet know Omicron’s severity, its exact rate of transmission,</p>

<p>nor indeed the full effectiveness of our vaccines against it.</p>

<p>But since I last spoke to you, it’s become increasingly clear that Omicron is growing much faster than the previous Delta variant,</p>

<p>and it’s spreading rapidly all around the world.</p>

<p>568 cases have been confirmed through genomic sequencing across every region of the UK,</p>

<p>and the true number is certain to be much higher.</p>

<p>Most worryingly, there is evidence that the doubling time of Omicron in the UK could currently be between two and three days.</p>

<p>And while there are some limits to what we can learn from South Africa,</p>

<p>Because of the different rates of vaccination and different rates of previous infection -</p>

<p>we are seeing growth in cases here in the UK that mirrors the rapid increases previously seen in South Africa.</p>

<p>And South Africa is also seeing hospitalisations roughly doubling in a week,</p>

<p>meaning that we can’t yet assume Omicron is less severe than previous variants.</p>

<p>So while the picture may get better,</p>

<ul>
  <li>and I sincerely hope that it will -</li>
</ul>

<p>we know the remorseless logic of exponential growth could lead to a big rise in hospitalisations, and therefore sadly in deaths.</p>

<p>And that is why it is now the proportionate and responsible thing to move to Plan B in England</p>

<p>while continuing to work closely with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations -</p>

<p>so we slow the spread of the virus,</p>

<p>buy ourselves the time to get yet more boosters into more arms, and especially in the older and more vulnerable people,</p>

<p>and understand the answers to the key outstanding questions about Omicron.</p>

<p>So first, we will reintroduce the guidance to work from home.</p>

<p>Employers should use the rest of this week to discuss working arrangements with their employees</p>

<p>but from Monday you should work from home if you can. Go to work if you must but work from home if you can.</p>

<p>And I know this will be hard for many people, but by reducing your contacts in the workplace you will help slow transmission.</p>

<p>Second, from this Friday we will further extend the legal requirement to wear a face mask to most public indoor venues, including theatres and cinemas.</p>

<p>There will be of course exemptions where it is not practical, such as when eating, drinking, exercising or singing.</p>

<p>Third, we’ll also make the NHS Covid Pass mandatory for entry into nightclubs, and venues where large crowds gather</p>

<p>including unseated indoor venues with more than 500 people,</p>

<p>unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people</p>

<p>and any venue with more than 10,000 people.</p>

<p>The NHS Covid Pass can still be obtained with two doses but we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out.</p>

<p>And having taken clinical advice since the emergence of Omicron, a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient.</p>

<p>As we set out in Plan B, we will give businesses a week’s notice, so this will come into force in a week’s time,</p>

<p>helping to keep these events and venues open at full capacity,</p>

<p>while giving everyone who attends them confidence that those around them have done the responsible thing to minimise risk to others.</p>

<p>As Omicron spreads in the community, we will also introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation,</p>

<p>so we keep people safe while minimising the disruption to daily life.</p>

<p>And of course we will take every step to ensure our NHS is ready for the challenges ahead.</p>

<p>But the single biggest thing that every one of us can do,</p>

<p>is to get our jabs</p>

<p>and crucially to get that booster as soon as our turn arrives.</p>

<p>One year to the day since the UK became the first country in the world to administer a Covid vaccine into the arms of Margaret Keenan,</p>

<p>we have opened up the vaccine booster to all those over 40,</p>

<p>and we are reducing the gap between second dose and booster to a minimum of just three months.</p>

<p>Our heroic NHS staff and volunteers have already done almost 21 million boosters,</p>

<p>including reaching 84 per cent of all the eligible over 80s.</p>

<p>But we need to go further and faster still,</p>

<p>because our scientists are absolutely confident that your immune response will be stronger if you have been boosted.</p>

<p>And while you are at it – please get your flu jab too.</p>

<p>Let’s do everything we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones this winter – and to reduce the pressures on our NHS.</p>

<p>As we learn more, so we will be guided by the hard medical data around four key criteria:</p>

<p>the efficacy of our vaccines and our boosters,</p>

<p>the severity of Omicron,</p>

<p>the speed of its spread,</p>

<p>and the rate of hospitalisations.</p>

<p>We will constantly monitor the data and keep it under review.</p>

<p>And of course we must be humble in the face of this virus</p>

<p>But if and indeed as soon as it becomes clear that the boosters are capable of holding this Omicron variant,</p>

<p>and we have boosted enough people to do that job</p>

<p>then we will be able to move forward as before.</p>

<p>So please everybody play your part - and get boosted.</p>
