<p>New technologies have always thrown up new questions about Intellectual Property.</p>

<p>Whether that’s the printing press revolution, the invention of recorded music, or the advent of the internet.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is no different.</p>

<p>Over the past ten years AI technologies have accelerated.</p>

<p>I’ve seen for myself the incredible impact they’re having across a huge range of sectors – from medicine to manufacturing.</p>

<p>While companies like Cervest [Sir-vest] are helping to solve some of the major challenges we’re facing, like climate change.</p>

<p>And AI technologies are increasingly becoming a part of everyday life – from social media, to personal assistants like Siri and Alexa.</p>

<p>The fact that there’s been a 400% increase in AI patent applications around the world in the past decade, shows you how fast things are moving.</p>

<p>And this pace of change is throwing up some really thorny questions.</p>

<p>Can a machine be a rights holder under law? For example.</p>

<p>And does it infringe copyright when it learns to paint like Rembrandt or sing like the Beatles?</p>

<p>As policy makers, it’s our job to address these questions.</p>

<p>So that law keeps up with advances in technology.</p>

<p>The fact that AI has such amazing potential to transform the way we live, work and create, makes this all the more important.</p>

<p>Because a strong intellectual property system is critical to releasing that potential.</p>

<p>IP is designed to drive innovation and enterprise, culture and creativity.</p>

<p>So, in the UK, for example, in September this year we launched a Call for Views. A consultation to gather information and ideas about AI and IP.</p>

<p>That’s because we value our AI industry and want to help it grow.</p>

<p>Because we know a strong AI sector needs a strong IP framework.</p>

<p>And because we realise that depends on understanding its commercial, economic, legal and social implications.</p>

<p>That’s what the consultation is looking at, as well as how the IP framework can incentivise people to develop and adopt those technologies.</p>

<p>We’re encouraging a wide range of people to reply – from industry to academia, and IP specialists.</p>

<p>And we would love to hear from any of you here today.</p>

<p>But as well as exploring these issues at home. To release the potential of AI technologies, we need to look for answers internationally. Across borders.</p>

<p>As we are doing today.</p>

<p>Because, as we all know, we are living in a global world.</p>

<p>Where Bollywood is as accessible to us Brits as the BBC.</p>

<p>Where I could speak to someone in Dubai just as easily as I can ring my family in Derby.</p>

<p>And so it’s absolutely essential that we work together.</p>

<p>To find common ground.</p>

<p>To develop common standards, definitions and approaches.</p>

<p>This will enable our AI industries to collaborate.</p>

<p>It will allow our institutions to share ideas. Applying these technologies to the common challenges we face.</p>

<p>And it will ensure consistency. Which is absolutely key.</p>

<p>Consistency leads to confidence. Which can unlock the huge global investment needed to bring AI technologies to market.</p>

<p>Whereas unclear definitions, and variable standards, create uncertainty.</p>

<p>Making it more difficult for business to operate across different systems. And threatening the ability of these technologies to benefit people across the world.</p>

<p>Businesses, investors and researchers need predictability, not difference, in the international system.</p>

<p>So, our approaches to the legal questions that have emerged need to align.</p>

<p>There’s no better forum for these international discussions on IP than WIPO.</p>

<p>The only international organisation focussed solely on intellectual property.</p>

<p>The guardian of international IP.</p>

<p>And home to the energy and expertise we need to help us to find the right answers.</p>

<p>So, I’m really pleased that WIPO’s been doing such fantastic work to help move this conversation forward.</p>

<p>And I’m proud of the UK’s role in making that happen.</p>

<p>Encouraging those initial discussions in 2018, for instance.</p>

<p>And supporting them to evolve into the policy-related questions we’re addressing today.</p>

<p>We want to work with WIPO to find common answers and tangible solutions to these questions.</p>

<p>Ones that take our different perspectives into account.</p>

<p>Because the issues we’ve been looking at in this and previous sessions are really important to getting to the common understanding we need.</p>

<p>And enabling IP to help AI fulfil its potential.</p>

<p>Getting to a shared definition of AI has to be the starting point.</p>

<p>We’ll never find common standards if we don’t know that we’re talking about the same thing.</p>

<p>We need these definitions to be technologically neutral and future proof.</p>

<p>And to be agreed and used globally, providing businesses with clarity and confidence.</p>

<p>At previous sessions, we’ve had some fantastic conversations about patents and copyright.</p>

<p>And we’ve got a couple of remaining important chapters to address at today’s third conversation. One of them being trade marks.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the WIPO paper, I want to touch on some work the UK is doing on trade marks and AI.</p>

<p>We’re in the final stages of developing an online AI tool to improve the chances of successfully registering a trade mark.</p>

<p>Helping applicants to select the correct trade mark classification.</p>

<p>So making it easier for businesses and entrepreneurs to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Particularly the large number of individuals applying, and all those smaller businesses that don’t have their own legal departments.</p>

<p>We’re looking at trade mark more broadly too.</p>

<p>The Call for Views which I’ve spoken about – the UK’s consultation on AI and IP – has touched on some similar trade mark issues to the ones we’re discussing today.</p>

<p>How AI might impact established principles such as human perception within trade mark law, for example. And authorship, and ownership of designs in light of AI.</p>

<p>So I’ll be really interested to hear the outcome of today’s discussion.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s capacity building. And accountability for IP Administrative decisions.</p>

<p>Because, as well as the thorny legal questions that AI raises, it also has huge potential to assist with the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>Particularly, protecting businesses and consumers online.</p>

<p>As e-commerce continues to grow, the challenge of enforcing rights is increasing. How can AI help us in this fight against fakes?</p>

<p>We need to address questions like these together.</p>

<p>As I’ve said, the UK is committed to working internationally on AI and IP.</p>

<p>And that doesn’t end with our search for common global standards.</p>

<p>We want to cooperate on capacity building too.</p>

<p>Helping to even out the technological capacity in this area, so that everyone can make the most of AI technology</p>

<p>We also need to establish a shared framework on administrative decisions. So that we have comparable protections across different countries.</p>

<p>This helps to establish that confidence and predictability that I’ve spoken about.</p>

<p>If AI is to help to identify and prosecute rights infringements. Stakeholders need to know how to challenge decisions, and the role humans will play.</p>

<p>So, I really welcome the discussions we’re having today on these important issues.</p>

<p>If they’re anything like the conversations that we’ve had so far, they’ll be informative and constructive.</p>

<p>And looking ahead, we want to keep the momentum going.</p>

<p>I hope that WIPO will develop a priority list of the areas we need to focus on in the next couple of months.</p>

<p>Things like inventorship in patents, authorship in copyright, and liability for infringement</p>

<p>I hope too that this prioritisation will be followed by a WIPO White Paper next year. Setting out proposals for a common framework, based on the discussions between us all.</p>

<p>We also want to use the power of the WIPO extraordinary General Assembly in 2021. To enable buy-in by Member States and decide future direction for this work.</p>

<p>Because, as I’ve said, AI technologies have such amazing potential for the world.</p>

<p>And it’s critical that we keep up the momentum on the ground breaking work we’ve started together.</p>

<p>To develop an IP system that supports AI technologies to thrive. Releasing their potential for us all.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
