<p>Thank you Mr Chair. This statement is delivered under the topic raised by Ukraine and I request that this be accurately reflected in the Journal of the Day.</p>

<p>Mr Chair, just over a month ago President Putin launched his unprovoked, premeditated and a barbaric attack on Ukraine. Just over a month ago, the Ukrainian people were living ordinary, peaceful lives. Now, as a result of President Putin’s actions, the UNHCR estimates 3.8 million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries and a further 12.7 million are stranded in conflict-affected areas within Ukraine. The humanitarian situation that President Putin has created is truly horrifying.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate destruction of civilian infrastructure and the horrendous amounts of violence unleashed on the Ukrainian people is abhorrent.</p>

<p>For weeks, frustrated Russian military commanders have been attempting to break the Ukrainian peoples’ spirit and resolve by subjecting them to a near continual onslaught from: Multi-launch Rocket Systems, ballistic missiles, artillery, cruise missiles, cluster munitions, thermobaric rockets, and unguided air dropped munitions. Maternity wards, schools, homes and other civilian infrastructure have been bombed without any regard for civilian life. Families are being starved out in freezing basement shelters and targeted as they flee. These are not the actions of a Great Power. They are reprehensible and cowardly.</p>

<p>All those carrying out war crimes should know they cannot act with impunity. Indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians amount to war crimes, for which those who are complicit, must be held accountable.</p>

<p>The once great Russian military has been frustrated and outsmarted by our Ukrainian friends who, against the odds, have snarled up Russia’s invading army, inflicting defeat after defeat. Their resistance remains staunch and well-coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory remains in Ukrainian hands. Ukraine has taken up the fight and shown the world the meaning of bravery and courage.</p>

<p>Mr Chair, the Russian government’s attempt to redraw the map of Europe in blood, and conquer an independent and democratic state by force of arms is an attack on the security and freedom of Europe. The United Kingdom, along with many others, repeatedly warned that this would be a massive strategic mistake and would come at a severe cost. In this regard, we continue to support Ukraine, our friends, in their fight for their homeland.</p>

<p>Last week, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-major-new-military-support-package-for-ukraine-24-march-2022">Prime Minister Johnson announced that the UK would provide 6000 more defensive missiles to Ukraine</a>. This now more than doubles the defensive lethal aid provided to date to a total of more than 10,000 missiles. Additionally, 25 million pounds of financial assistance for the Ukrainian military was also announced.</p>

<p>I would reiterate, all of our support to the democratic sovereign nation of Ukraine is defensive in nature and will help them defend themselves against this Russian war of aggression.</p>

<p>Mr Chair, President Putin badly miscalculated in Ukraine. His Plan A has failed, his ridiculous false pretexts exposed for the world to see, and yet, his government continues to peddle disinformation and censor free speech to try and cover up his lies.</p>

<p>Those complicit in the Kremlin’s unprovoked aggression and those who peddle its blizzard of lies to hide the truth from the Russian people should be ashamed. They have lost their last shred of credibility with the international community. How can they stand in front of the mirror and look at themselves with dignity or self-respect? How can they look at their family and friends with integrity? Their part in the Kremlin’s unprovoked, premeditated and barbaric attack on Ukraine has led the Russian people into a quagmire and turned Russia into an international pariah. Shame on them.</p>

<p>We will make the Russian government pay the price of its actions. The UK stands with the Ukrainian people in their fight for their homeland. We will work with our partners – for however long it takes – to ensure that the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the independence of Ukraine is restored.</p>

<p>Thank you. And I ask that this statement be attached to the journal of the day.</p>
