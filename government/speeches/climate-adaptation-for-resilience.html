<p>A huge thank you to the World Economic Forum and the Netherlands for organising this panel. And to my fellow panel members for their brilliant insight.</p>

<p>2021 is indeed going to be a critical year for the climate.</p>

<p>And I want to see the golden thread of climate action woven through every international event on the road to Glasgow.</p>

<p>At the Climate Ambition Summit, which the UK co-hosted with the UN and France last December, we had 75 world leaders come forward to make concrete commitments.</p>

<p>I set out four key priorities of COP26.</p>

<p>First, to secure a step change in emissions reductions which we all want to see.</p>

<p>Second, to strengthen adaptation, protecting people and nature.</p>

<p>Third, to get finance flowing to climate action.</p>

<p>Both public and private finance.</p>

<p>And fourth, to enhance international cooperation on this issue.</p>

<p>Among policy makers, investors, business and civil society.</p>

<p>Today, I want to focus on the last three of these priorities.</p>

<p>And how they work together.</p>

<p>The reality is the effects of climate change are already with us.</p>

<p>So it is vital that we go further and faster on adaptation.</p>

<p>We need to build resilience into our societies and economies.</p>

<p>That requires action from us all: governments, cities, investors, business, and civil society.</p>

<p>The human and economic case is absolutely overwhelming.</p>

<p>We know that the most vulnerable are at the greatest risk from climate change.</p>

<p>Those that have done the least to cause it.</p>

<p>Time and again we have seen the devastation and human misery wracked by storms, droughts and rising sea levels.</p>

<p>We know that without sufficient action, millions will lose their lives and livelihoods.</p>

<p>And many millions will be pushed very sadly into poverty.</p>

<p>We’ve heard from the Global Centre for Adaptation, that every dollar spent on adaptation, yields between two and ten times that in avoided costs and damages.
So as COP26 President, I am calling on leaders in all sectors to up their ambition and action on adaptation.</p>

<p>I am urging countries to come forward with ambitious adaptation plans and communications.</p>

<p>As the UK did last month.</p>

<p>I am encouraging governments to align their recovery packages with the Paris Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>And, I am asking business, cities, civil society and more to join the Race to Resilience campaign, which we launched yesterday to increase ambition on resilience across society.</p>

<p>The UK is also helping to find practical solutions on adaptation.</p>

<p>Launching the Adaptation Research Alliance last week, to do just that.</p>

<p>And proudly supporting LIFE-AR.</p>

<p>A programme led by the least developed countries to aid their adaptation.</p>

<p>Because we are committed to adaptation being locally led.</p>

<p>And to making progress faster through international collaboration.</p>

<p>That is why, yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched the Adaptation Action Coalition.</p>

<p>With our partners, Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, St Lucia, the UN, and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Critically, we are also working with donors, development banks, and private investors to get adaptation and resilience finance flowing faster and stronger, particularly to developing countries.</p>

<p>With organisations like the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment, for example, and through that we are encouraging investors to take climate risk into account in every decision.</p>

<p>Last year we launched an initiative to accelerate investment in adaptation and resilience through Development Finance Institutions – which I urge other DFIs to join.</p>

<p>I am also urging donors to significantly increase international climate finance commitments and ensure a balance between adaptation and mitigation.</p>

<p>We need to ensure that not only must donor countries honour that totemic USD 100 billion pledge.</p>

<p>But adaptation should no longer be regarded as the poor cousin to mitigation when it comes to finance flows.</p>

<p>I believe, if we get finance moving.</p>

<p>If we work together.</p>

<p>And if we have the ambition and support to act.</p>

<p>We can increase the scale and the pace of our adaptation.</p>

<p>And by that we will protect our people, our natural environment, and our economies.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
