          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Good afternoon,</p>

<p>I have just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency COBR committee,</p>

<p>following the sickening attack outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital yesterday.</p>

<p>My thoughts remain with all those affected,</p>

<p>and, on behalf of the whole country, I want to pay tribute to the emergency services who responded as always with such speed and professionalism.</p>

<p>The police have now confirmed this is being treated as a terrorist attack</p>

<p>and while the investigation continues at pace, you will understand that I can’t comment on the details of the case or its motivation.</p>

<p>But it is a stark reminder of the need for us all to remain utterly vigilant,</p>

<p>and the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre are today raising the UK’s threat level from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely.</p>

<p>But what yesterday showed above all,</p>

<p>is that the British people will never be cowed by terrorism.</p>

<p>We will never give in to those who seek to divide us with senseless acts of violence,</p>

<p>and our freedoms and our way of life will always prevail.</p>

<p>Turning to Covid, I want to update you on our progress,</p>

<p>and, in particular, on these storm clouds that are gathering over the continent.</p>

<p>A new wave of Covid has steadily swept through central Europe and is now affecting our nearest neighbours in Western Europe.</p>

<p>Our friends on the continent have been forced to respond with various degrees of new restrictions,</p>

<p>from full lockdowns, to lockdowns for the unvaccinated, to restrictions on business opening hours and restrictions on social gatherings.</p>

<p>We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will wash up on our shores,</p>

<p>but history shows we cannot afford to be complacent.</p>

<p>Indeed in recent days cases there have been rising here in the UK, so we must remain vigilant.</p>

<p>Because there is one lesson we can draw from the current situation in Europe.</p>

<p>Those countries with lower vaccination rates have tended to see bigger surges in infection, and in turn been forced to respond with harsher measures.</p>

<p>While those countries with higher vaccination rates have, so far, fared better.</p>

<p>This shows us once again that if we want to control the epidemic here in the UK,</p>

<p>and if we want to avoid new restrictions on our daily lives, we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.</p>

<p>Today, following the recommendation of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,</p>

<p>we are making second jabs available to all 16 and 17 year olds,</p>

<p>from 12 weeks after their first dose.</p>

<p>And we are making boosters available to all those aged 40 to 49</p>

<p>from six months after their second dose.</p>

<p>Boosters as you know are already available for all those over 50,</p>

<p>those with underlying health conditions</p>

<p>and those working on the frontline of our NHS and in care homes.</p>

<p>And let me explain why that booster is absolutely crucial,</p>

<p>because over time the protection from two jabs starts to wane,</p>

<p>but that the third jab boosts protection back up to over 90 per cent against symptomatic infection.</p>

<p>So far around 12.6 million people across the UK have had that booster,</p>

<p>including in England around three-quarters of all people over 70</p>

<p>and 80 per cent of eligible older people in care homes.</p>

<p>But many more people who are eligible have not yet come forward.</p>

<p>And so if you are one of those people, please go and get that third jab.</p>

<p>Because it would be an utter tragedy if, after everything we have been through,</p>

<p>people who had done the right thing by getting double vaccinated</p>

<p>ended up becoming seriously ill or even losing their lives</p>

<p>because they allowed their immunity to wane by not getting their booster.</p>

<p>And if you haven’t even had one dose, it’s not too late.</p>

<p>In fact there’s never been a better time to get that vital protection as we head into winter.</p>

<p>So please, please go and get vaccinated,</p>

<p>to protect yourself and others,</p>

<p>and in doing so we can help to ensure that we can continue in the way that we are</p>

<p>sticking to our plan of using vaccination to control this virus.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
