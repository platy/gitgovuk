<p>Good morning – and welcome to Cop26 finance day.</p>

<p>It’s easy to feel daunted by the scale of the challenge that we face.</p>

<p>By sea levels rising; droughts and wildfires spreading; people forced out of their homes.</p>

<p>But I look around this hall and I feel optimism.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because this is the first COP to bring together so many of the world’s finance ministers, businesses and investors with such a clear common purpose:</p>

<p>To deliver the promise, made in Paris six years ago, to direct the world’s wealth to protect our planet.</p>

<p>The good news is that the will is there:</p>

<p>At least 80% of the global economy has committed to net zero or carbon neutrality targets.</p>

<p>Our challenge now is to deploy the investment we need to deliver those targets around the world.</p>

<p>To do so, we are accelerating three actions today.</p>

<p>First, we need increased public investment.</p>

<p>And I want to speak directly to the developing countries of the world:</p>

<p>We know you’ve been devastated by the double tragedies of coronavirus and climate change.</p>

<p>That’s why the G20 is stepping up to provide debt treatments more swiftly.</p>

<p>It’s why the IMF are providing a new, $650bn allocation of special drawing rights – and Kristalina will say more on this later.</p>

<p>And its why we are going to meet the target to provide $100bn of climate finance to developing countries.</p>

<p>And while we know we are not yet meeting it soon enough, we will work closely with developing countries to do more and reach the target sooner.</p>

<p>Over the next five years, we will deliver a total of $500bn investment to the countries that need it most.</p>

<p>And we can do more today:</p>

<p>I can announce that the United Kingdom will commit £100m to the Taskforce on Access to Climate Finance, making it quicker and easier for developing countries to finance they need.</p>

<p>And we’re supporting a new Capital Markets Mechanism, which will issue billions of new green bonds here in the UK, to fund renewable energy in developing countries.</p>

<p>Two tangible, practical examples of how we’re delivering our promise of $100bn.</p>

<p>But public investment alone isn’t enough. Our second action is to mobilise private finance.</p>

<p>Let me pay an enormous tribute to Mark Carney for his leadership – leadership that is delivering results.</p>

<p>The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero has now brought together financial organisations with assets worth over $130 trillion of capital to be deployed.</p>

<p>This is an historic wall of capital for the net zero transition around the world.</p>

<p>What matters now is action: to invest that capital in our low carbon future.</p>

<p>To do that, investors need to have as much clarity and confidence in the climate impact of their investments as they do in the traditional financial metrics of profit and loss.</p>

<p>So our third action is to rewire the entire global financial system for Net Zero.</p>

<p>Better and more consistent climate data.</p>

<p>Sovereign green bonds.</p>

<p>Mandatory sustainability disclosures.</p>

<p>Proper climate risk surveillance.</p>

<p>Stronger global reporting standards.</p>

<p>All things we need to deliver and I’m proud that the UK is playing its part.</p>

<p>We’ve already made it mandatory for businesses to disclose climate-related financial information.</p>

<p>With 35 other countries signing up to do the same.</p>

<p>Today I’m announcing that the UK will go further and become the first ever ‘Net Zero Aligned Financial Centre’.</p>

<p>This means we are going to move towards making it mandatory for firms to publish a clear, deliverable plan…</p>

<p>…setting out how they will decarbonise and transition to Net Zero – with an independent Taskforce to define what’s required.</p>

<p>So: a renewed pledge to $100bn a year of public funding;</p>

<p>Over $130 trillion of private capital waiting to be deployed;</p>

<p>And a greener financial system, under way.</p>

<p>Six years ago, Paris set the ambition.</p>

<p>Today, in Glasgow, we’re providing the investment we need to deliver that ambition.</p>

<p>Now I know that when people hear about global finance it can feel remote and abstract.</p>

<p>But we’re not simply talking about numbers on a page.</p>

<p>We’re talking about making a tangible difference to people’s lives.</p>

<p>About cheap, reliable and clean electricity to power schools and hospitals in rural Africa.</p>

<p>About better coastal defences in the Philippines and the pacific islands to protect people from storm surges.</p>

<p>About everyone, everywhere having fresher water to drink…</p>

<p>…cleaner air to breathe…</p>

<p>…better insulated homes in which to live.</p>

<p>That’s the vision we’re asking you to commit to.</p>

<p>That’s the opportunity we’re asking you to invest in.</p>

<p>And that’s the work we’re asking you to begin, today.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
