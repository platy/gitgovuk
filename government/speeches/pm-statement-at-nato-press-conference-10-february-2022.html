<p>When NATO was founded more than 75 years ago, its members made a commitment to collective security that was unlike anything in previous history.</p>

<p>And when the Berlin Wall fell the people of Europe made it clear they wanted a future where their freedom and their security are inextricably tied together.</p>

<p>That is why NATO agreed that any country should be free to pursue the security alliances that it, that country chose.</p>

<p>And we must resist, we must oppose any return to the days when the fates of nations are decided over their heads by a handful of great powers.</p>

<p>And I want to stress this is not just about Russia, just as NATO itself is not just about Russia, of course not.</p>

<p>This is about upholding the founding principles of an alliance which, perhaps more than any other institution, has brought stability and peace, prosperity to the world.</p>

<p>And that must be the bedrock of our diplomatic efforts.</p>

<p>The UK’s commitment to European security is unconditional and immovable. We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO.</p>

<p>We have contributed more troops than any other ally to NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence.</p>

<p>And today I have agreed with the Secretary General a package of support to strengthen further our collective security, sending troops, planes and ships to defend NATO from north to south.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I met the Prime Minister of Lithuania and I will be travelling shortly to Poland.</p>

<p>And these are the countries where every day the population wakes up with an acute awareness of the threat just across their border.</p>

<p>And they are countries whose voices and views must be at the heart of every discussion we have.</p>

<p>Because I believe that if we can keep a strong grip on the fundamentals, those fundamental principles that define our alliance and combine strong deterrence with patient diplomacy, then we can find our way through this crisis.</p>

<p>But the stakes are very high and this is a very dangerous moment.</p>

<p>And at stake are the rules that protect every nation, every nation – big and small.</p>

<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
