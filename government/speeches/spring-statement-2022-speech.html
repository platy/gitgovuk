          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>As I stand here, men, women and children are huddled in basements across Ukraine seeking protection.</p>

<p>Soldiers and citizens alike have taken up arms to defend their land and families.</p>

<p>The sorrow we feel for their suffering, and admiration for their bravery…</p>

<p>…is only matched by the gratitude we feel for the security in which we live.</p>

<p>And what underpins that security…is the strength of our economy.</p>

<p>It gives us the ability to fund the armed forces we need to maintain our liberty.</p>

<p>The resources we need to support our allies.</p>

<p>The power to impose sanctions which cause severe economic costs.</p>

<p>And the flexibility to support businesses and individuals through crises as they emerge</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker, we should be in no doubt, behind Putin’s invasion is a dangerous calculation:</p>

<p>That democracies are divided, politically weak, and economically insecure.</p>

<p>Incapable of making tough long-term decisions to strengthen our economies.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, this calculation is mistaken.</p>

<p>What the authoritarian mind perceives as division – we know are the passionate disagreements at the heart of our living, breathing democracy.</p>

<p>What they see as chaos – we know is the freedom to be dynamic and innovative.</p>

<p>What they call the inherent weakness of open societies and free economies – we know is the source of our strength.</p>

<p>We will confront this challenge to our values not just in the arms and resources we send to Ukraine…</p>

<p>…but in strengthening our economy here at home.</p>

<p>So when I talk about security, yes – I mean responding to the war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>But I also mean the security of a faster growing economy.</p>

<p>The security of more resilient public finances.</p>

<p>And security for working families as we help with the cost of living.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Today’s statement builds a stronger, more secure economy for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>We have a moral responsibility to use our economic strength to support Ukraine and…</p>

<p>…working with international partners…</p>

<p>…to impose severe costs on Putin’s regime.</p>

<p>We are supplying military aid to help Ukraine defend its borders.</p>

<p>Providing around £400m in economic and humanitarian aid…</p>

<p>…as well as up to $0.5bn in multilateral financial guarantees.</p>

<p>And launching the new ‘Homes for Ukraine’ scheme…</p>

<p>…to make sure those forced to flee have a route to safety here in the UK.</p>

<p>And we are imposing sanctions of unprecedented scale and scope:</p>

<p>We’ve sanctioned over 1,000 individuals, entities, and subsidiaries.</p>

<p>Frozen the assets of major Russian banks.</p>

<p>Imposed punitive tariffs on key products.</p>

<p>Restricted Russia’s access to sterling clearing…</p>

<p>To insurance.</p>

<p>To the UK’s capital markets.</p>

<p>To SWIFT.</p>

<p>And we’ve targeted the Russian Central Bank, too.</p>

<p>Be in no doubt: these sanctions, coordinated with our allies, are working.</p>

<p>The Russian Rouble plummeted to record lows.</p>

<p>The Moscow stock exchange has been largely suspended for a month.</p>

<p>And the Central Bank of Russia has been forced to more than double interest rates to 20%.</p>

<p>We warned that an aggressive, unprovoked invasion would be met with severe economic costs – and it has.</p>

<p>I’m proud to say – as the whole House will say:</p>

<p>We stand with Ukraine.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The actions we have taken to sanction Putin’s regime are not cost free for us at home.</p>

<p>The invasion of Ukraine presents a risk to our recovery – as it does to countries around the world.</p>

<p>We came into this crisis with our economy growing faster than expected…</p>

<p>…with the UK having the highest growth rate in the G7 last year.</p>

<p>But the OBR has said specifically:</p>

<p>“There is unusually high uncertainty around the outlook”;</p>

<p>It is too early to know the full impact of the Ukraine war on the UK economy.</p>

<p>But their initial view, combined with high global inflation and continuing supply chain pressures, means the OBR now forecast growth this year of 3.8%.</p>

<p>The OBR then expect the economy to grow by 1.8% in 2023, and 2.1%, 1.8% and 1.7% in the following three years.</p>

<p>The House will take comfort that the lower growth outlook has not affected our strong jobs performance:</p>

<p>Unemployment is now forecast to be lower, in every year of the forecast.</p>

<p>It is already at 3.9% - back to the low levels we saw before the pandemic.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker, the war’s most significant impact domestically is on the cost of living.</p>

<p>Covid and global factors meant goods and energy prices were already high:</p>

<p>Statistics published this morning show that inflation in February was 6.2%…</p>

<p>…lower than the US and broadly in line with the Euro area.</p>

<p>Disruptions to global supply chains and energy markets…</p>

<p>…combined with the economic response to Putin’s aggression…</p>

<p>…mean the OBR expect inflation to rise further, averaging 7.4% this year.</p>

<p>As I said last month, the government will support the British people as they deal with the rising costs of energy.</p>

<p>People should know that we will stand by them, as we have throughout the last two years.</p>

<p>That’s why we’ve announced a £9bn plan to help around 28 million households…</p>

<p>…pay around half of the April increase in the energy price cap.</p>

<p>And people should be reassured that the energy price cap will protect their energy bills, between now and the autumn.</p>

<p>But I want to help people now.</p>

<p>So I’m announcing three immediate measures.</p>

<p>First, I’m going to help motorists.</p>

<p>Today I can announce for only the second time in 20 years, fuel duty will be cut.</p>

<p>Not by 1, not even by 2, but by 5 pence per litre.</p>

<p>The biggest cut to all fuel duty rates – ever.</p>

<p>And while some have called for the cut to last until August, I have decided it will be in place until March next year – a full 12 months.</p>

<p>Together with the freeze, it’s a tax cut this year for hard-working families and businesses worth over £5 billion.</p>

<p>And it will take effect from 6pm tonight.</p>

<p>Second, as energy costs rise, we know that energy efficiency will make a big difference to bills.</p>

<p>But if homeowners want to install energy saving materials…</p>

<p>…at the moment only some items qualify for a 5% VAT relief…</p>

<p>…and there are complex rules about who is eligible.</p>

<p>The relief used to be more generous but from 2019 the European Court of Justice required us to restrict its eligibility.</p>

<p>But…thanks to Brexit…we’re no longer constrained by EU law.</p>

<p>So, I can announce for the next five years…</p>

<p>…homeowners having materials like solar panels, heat pumps, or insulation installed…</p>

<p>…will no longer pay 5% VAT– they will pay zero.</p>

<p>We’ll also reverse the EU’s decision to take wind and water turbines out of scope – and zero rate them as well.</p>

<p>And we’ll abolish all the red tape imposed on us by the EU.</p>

<p>A family having a solar panel installed will see tax savings worth  £1,000.</p>

<p>And savings on their energy bill of over £300 per year.</p>

<p>And Mr Speaker, this policy highlights the deficiencies in the Northern Ireland Protocol…</p>

<p>…because we won’t immediately be able to apply it to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>But we will be raising it with the Commission as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>And I want to reassure Members from Northern Ireland…</p>

<p>…that the Executive will receive a Barnett share of the value of the relief until it can be introduced UK-wide.</p>

<p>And the Prime Minister will bring forward further measures to reinforce our long-term energy security, in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>And finally, I want to do more to help our most vulnerable households with rising costs. 
They need targeted support.</p>

<p>So I am doubling the Household Support Fund to £1bn with £500m of new funding</p>

<p>Local Authorities are best placed to help those in need in their local areas.</p>

<p>and they will receive this funding from April.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>We can only afford to provide this extra support because of our stronger economy…</p>

<p>…and the tough but responsible decisions we’ve taken to rebuild our fiscal resilience.</p>

<p>Today’s forecasts confirm even after the measures I’m announcing today, we are meeting all our fiscal rules.</p>

<p>Underlying debt is expected to fall steadily from 83.5% of GDP in 2022-23 to 79.8% in 2026-27.</p>

<p>Borrowing as a percentage of GDP is 5.4% this year, 3.9% next year, then 1.9%, 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.1% in the following years.</p>

<p>At a time when the OBR has said that our fiscal headroom could be …</p>

<p>…“wiped out by relatively small changes to the economic outlook” …</p>

<p>…it is right that the central fiscal judgement I am making today is to meet our fiscal rules with a margin of safety.</p>

<p>The OBR have not accounted for the full impacts of the war in Ukraine…</p>

<p>…and we should be prepared for the economy and public finances to worsen – potentially significantly.</p>

<p>And the cost of borrowing is continuing to rise.</p>

<p>In the next financial year, we’re forecast to spend £83bn on debt interest – the highest on record.</p>

<p>And almost four times the amount we spent last year.</p>

<p>That’s why, Mr Speaker, we have already taken difficult decisions with the public finances;</p>

<p>And that’s why we will continue to weigh carefully calls for additional public spending.</p>

<p>More borrowing is not cost or risk free.</p>

<p>I said it last autumn, and I say it again today: borrowing down; debt down</p>

<p>So Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Our response to the immediate crisis in Ukraine has been unwavering.</p>

<p>But we must be equally bold in response to the deeper, and more fundamental challenge Putin poses to our values.</p>

<p>We must show the world that freedom and democracy remain the best route to peace, prosperity, and happiness.</p>

<p>We will do so by strengthening our economy here at home.</p>

<p>To that end, we are helping families with the cost of living;</p>

<p>Creating the conditions for accelerated growth and productivity;</p>

<p>And making sure the proceeds of growth are shared fairly.</p>

<p>That is not the work of any one statement.</p>

<p>But it does begin today – and with one of our most important levers: the tax system.</p>

<p>I told the House last Autumn my overarching ambition was to reduce taxes by the end of this Parliament.</p>

<p>And we will do so – in a way that is responsible and sustainable.</p>

<p>Today, I am publishing a Tax Plan.</p>

<p>We will take a principled approach to cutting taxes:</p>

<p>Maintaining space against our fiscal rules – as I have done today.</p>

<p>Continuing to be disciplined, with the first call on any extra resources being lower taxes, not higher spending.</p>

<p>And, of course, carefully considering the broader macroeconomic outlook.</p>

<p>With those principles in mind, our new Tax Plan will build a stronger economy by reducing and reforming taxes over this Parliament, in three ways:</p>

<p>First, we will help families with the cost of living.</p>

<p>Second, we will create the conditions for higher growth.</p>

<p>And third, we will share the proceeds of growth fairly. Ensuring people are left with more of their own money.</p>

<p>Let me take each in turn.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>There is now a dedicated funding source for the country’s top priority – the NHS and social care.</p>

<p>Providing funding over the long-term, as demand grows.</p>

<p>With every penny going straight to health and care.</p>

<p>If it goes…then so does the funding.</p>

<p>And that funding is needed now.</p>

<p>Especially as my RHF the Health Secretary’s plans to reform healthcare, will ensure every pound of taxpayers’ money is well spent.</p>

<p>When I said we were a government for public services, a government for the NHS, I didn’t just mean ‘when it was easy’… it is a total commitment.</p>

<p>So, it is right that the health and care levy stays.</p>

<p>But a long-term funding solution for the NHS and social care is not incompatible with reducing taxes on working families.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, it has been our mission to promote tax cuts for working people and simplify the system.</p>

<p>That’s why the government raised the income tax personal allowance from £6,500 in 2010 to the new level of £12,570.</p>

<p>But the equivalent thresholds in National Insurance – which define how much people can earn NICs-free – are still around £3,000 less.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister pledged in the 2019 election we would increase those thresholds.</p>

<p>We made a big step towards that goal in my first Budget in 2020, increasing the National Insurance threshold to £9,500.</p>

<p>Today, we take the next step.</p>

<p>Our current plan is to increase the NICs threshold this year by £300.</p>

<p>I’m not going to do that.</p>

<p>I’m going to increase it by the full £3,000.</p>

<p>Delivering our promise to fully equalise the NICs and income tax thresholds.</p>

<p>And not incrementally over many years, but in one go, this year.</p>

<p>From this July, people will be able to earn £12,570 a year without paying a single penny of income tax or National Insurance.</p>

<p>That’s a £6 billion personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>A tax cut for employees worth over £330 a year.</p>

<p>The largest increase in a basic rate threshold – ever.</p>

<p>And the largest single personal tax cut in a decade.</p>

<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called it: “the best way to help low and middle earners through the tax system”.</p>

<p>It creates what the Centre for Policy Studies has called a “universal working income”.</p>

<p>It is a tax cut that rewards work.</p>

<p>And, Mr Speaker, around 70% of all workers will have their taxes cut by more than the amount they’ll pay through the new Levy.</p>

<p>Once again showing it is this government delivering for hardworking families and helping with the cost of living.</p>

<p>So, Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The first part of our Tax Plan for a stronger economy is to support families with the cost of living.</p>

<p>But as I set out in last month’s Mais lecture…</p>

<p>…to lift our growth and productivity we need the private sector to train more, invest more, and innovate more.</p>

<p>People. Capital. Ideas.</p>

<p>That’s how we’ll create a new culture of enterprise – the second part of our Tax Plan.</p>

<p>The plan sets out tax cutting options on business investment and innovation, with final decisions to be announced in the Autumn Budget.</p>

<p>But these are significant and complex questions, so we will work with businesses over the summer to get the answers right.</p>

<p>Let me explain to the House the direction of travel.</p>

<p>First, people.</p>

<p>We lag international peers in adult technical skills:</p>

<p>Just 18% of 25-64 year olds’ hold vocational qualifications, a third lower than the OECD average.</p>

<p>And UK employers spend just half the European average on training their employees.</p>

<p>So, we will consider whether the current tax system, including the operation of the Apprenticeship Levy…</p>

<p>…is doing enough to incentivise businesses to invest in the right kinds of training.</p>

<p>Second, ideas.</p>

<p>Over the last fifty years, innovation drove around half the UK’s productivity growth.</p>

<p>But since the financial crisis, the rate of increase has slowed more than in other countries.</p>

<p>And our lower rate of innovation explains almost all our productivity gap with the United States.</p>

<p>Right now, we know that the amount businesses spend on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP is less than half the OECD average.</p>

<p>And that is despite us spending more on tax reliefs than almost every other country.</p>

<p>Something is not working.</p>

<p>So we’ll reform R&amp;D tax credits so that they’re effective and better value for money.</p>

<p>We’ll expand the generosity of the reliefs to include data, cloud computing, and pure maths.</p>

<p>And we’ll consider, in the autumn, whether to make the R&amp;D expenditure credit more generous.</p>

<p>Third, capital.</p>

<p>Weak private sector investment is a longstanding cause of our productivity gap internationally:</p>

<p>Capital investment by UK businesses is considerably lower than the OECD average of 14%.</p>

<p>And it accounts for fully half our productivity gap with France and Germany.</p>

<p>Once the Super Deduction ends next year, our overall tax treatment for capital investment will be far less generous than other advanced economies.</p>

<p>We’re going to fix that.</p>

<p>In the Autumn Budget, we will cut the tax rates on business investment.</p>

<p>And I look forward to discussing the best way to do that with businesses.</p>

<p>People. Capital. Ideas.</p>

<p>Three priorities for business tax cuts this autumn.</p>

<p>But, Mr Speaker, I want to help smaller businesses right now.</p>

<p>So let me remind the House of our plan:</p>

<p>Our business rates discount will take effect in April for retail, hospitality, and leisure businesses.</p>

<p>They’ll get a 50% discount on their business rates bill, up to £110,000.</p>

<p>A typical pub will save £5,000.</p>

<p>That’s a tax cut for hundreds of thousands of small businesses worth £1.7 billion.</p>

<p>Taking effect in just one weeks’ time.</p>

<p>Our Help to Grow: Management scheme offers businesses mini-MBAs, 90% funded by government – a benefit worth several thousand pounds.</p>

<p>And Help to Grow: Digital gives businesses a 50% discount on buying new software worth up to £5,000.</p>

<p>We’ve also increased the Annual Investment Allowance to £1 million;</p>

<p>So that all small and medium sized businesses will feel the benefit of full expensing.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker, I want to respond to the specific calls from small businesses, with one further announcement today.</p>

<p>The Employment Allowance cuts small businesses’ tax bills, making it cheaper to employ workers.</p>

<p>In my first Budget two years ago, I increased that allowance.</p>

<p>Today, I am going further.</p>

<p>From April, the Employment Allowance will increase to £5,000.</p>

<p>That’s a new tax cut worth up to £1,000 for half a million small businesses – starting in just two weeks’ time.</p>

<p>So, Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Future tax cuts on business investment and innovation.</p>

<p>A business rates discount worth £1.7 billion.</p>

<p>Help to Grow schemes worth thousands of pounds per business.</p>

<p>An annual investment allowance worth up to £1 million.</p>

<p>And a new tax cut on the costs of employment worth £1,000 per company.</p>

<p>Once again, Mr Speaker, it is this government delivering for British business.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The tax plan I’ve announced today will help people and businesses deal with rising costs.</p>

<p>Will help raise the future growth rate of this country.</p>

<p>But we want the proceeds of growth shared fairly – the third objective of our tax plan.</p>

<p>The knowledge you can keep more of what you earn is a powerful incentive for people to work hard.</p>

<p>It means greater economic security, and we know that individuals spend their money better than governments do.</p>

<p>We’ve already announced today the equalisation of personal tax thresholds, giving over 30 million workers a tax cut worth over £330.</p>

<p>And, over time, I want to go further.</p>

<p>But tax cuts must be paid for.</p>

<p>They must be prioritised.</p>

<p>And they must fit the economic circumstances of the time.</p>

<p>A clear goal for previous Chancellors… … has been to cut Income Tax…</p>

<p>The fact this has happened only twice in 20 years tells you how hard it is to do.</p>

<p>Covid and the war in Ukraine have only added to the difficulty of achieving this by the end of this Parliament.</p>

<p>I am sure all Members of the House recognise and understand those challenges.</p>

<p>It would clearly be irresponsible to meet this ambition this year.</p>

<p>And yet…I refuse to let that ambition whither and drift.</p>

<p>By 2024, the OBR currently expect inflation to be back under control, debt falling sustainably, and the economy growing.</p>

<p>Our fiscal rules are met with a clear margin of safety.</p>

<p>And so my final announcement today is this:</p>

<p>I can confirm, before the end of this Parliament, in 2024, for the first time in sixteen years…</p>

<p>…the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20 to 19 pence in the pound.</p>

<p>A tax cut for workers, for pensioners, for savers.</p>

<p>A £5bn tax cut for 30 million people.</p>

<p>Let me be clear with the House: It is fully costed and fully paid for in the plans announced today.</p>

<p>Last year, I told the House I would cut taxes for hardworking families…</p>

<p>…but I would do so in a responsible and sustainable way…</p>

<p>…and today, I am delivering on that promise.</p>

<p>So let me say this …</p>

<p>Cutting taxes is not easy, it requires hard work, prioritisation…</p>

<p>…and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is only because this government has been prepared to make those difficult but responsible choices to fix our public finances…</p>

<p>…that I can stand here and tell this House that not only are taxes being cut…</p>

<p>…but that debt is also falling…whilst public spending is increasing.</p>

<p>This doesn’t happen by accident Mr Speaker…</p>

<p>We can deliver for the British people today and into the future…</p>

<p>We have a plan.</p>

<p>A plan that reforms and improves public services.</p>

<p>A plan to grow our economy</p>

<p>A plan to level up across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>A plan that helps families with the cost of living.</p>

<p>And yes, a tax plan…</p>

<p>…that cuts taxes on working families by over £330.</p>

<p>Cuts taxes on fuel by 5p per litre.</p>

<p>Cuts taxes on business.</p>

<p>And yes… for the first time in a long time…</p>

<p>Cuts income tax.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, let me end by simply saying this:</p>

<p>My Tax Plan delivers the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>And I commend it to the House.</p>
