<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>First, can I just say that I’m delighted to be representing the UK at this important summit.</p>

<p>It’s important because - as President Biden has said - democracy isn’t a given. Every generation has to fight for it.</p>

<p>As one of the world’s oldest democracies, the UK has a real dog in this fight, as the Americans like to say.</p>

<p>And in 2021, in what is officially the “Digital Age” of mankind, much of that battle is now waged online.</p>

<p>So I want to take this opportunity to talk a little about democracy and technology.</p>

<p>About the huge benefits that tech has brought to free nations all over the world.</p>

<p>But also ultimately, what we’re doing in the UK - and with countries around the world - to ensure the tech revolution is a democratic one.</p>

<p>Only last week, I welcomed government officials from around the world to London, for the Future Tech Forum.</p>

<p>And while we were there, we had some really honest and frank conversations about the challenges we’re currently facing.</p>

<p>I think it’s important, as always, to remind ourselves that tech has done so much to improve our lives…</p>

<p>…to make us more prosperous and more productive, to connect us with friends and family all over the world.</p>

<p>But given the vast power of tech today, there’s also, unfortunately, vast potential for it to be used to cause harm.</p>

<p>Algorithms can send dangerous misinformation and poisonous abuse all over the world in seconds.</p>

<p>Authoritarian governments can use tech to track, to intimidate, and to repress.</p>

<p>It’s on all of us to mitigate those risks, and make sure that tech reflects our liberal, democratic values.</p>

<p>Until now, governments around the world have been a little on the back foot with all of this.</p>

<p>The pace of change in tech is so fast, we’re often playing catch-up.</p>

<p>But from what I saw at the Future Tech Forum, there’s now real political will - and real momentum - across the globe to set some solid ground rules: ones that will define the next chapter of tech.</p>

<p>And the UK is helping to write those rules.</p>

<p>A few months ago, we published our draft Online Safety Bill.</p>

<p>This is a truly groundbreaking piece of legislation.</p>

<p>It’s one of the most comprehensive attempts to regulate big tech companies, like Facebook and Twitter and TikTok for the very first time.</p>

<p>And we’ll be going further than any other country to hold them accountable for what’s on their platforms and to enshrine protections for freedom of expression.</p>

<p>But like a lot of countries, including the U.S., we’re also looking at how our democratic values can be baked in from the start - which brings me to the theme of this event.</p>

<p>Of all the democracy-affirming technologies, we’re particularly interested in ones that can help us use personal or sensitive data responsibly.</p>

<p>And so the UK government is actively exploring the role of privacy-enhancing technologies, or PETs, to support confidential data sharing, access and use.</p>

<p>The US and UK have both been doing cutting edge work in this area.</p>

<p>But we felt we needed to go further.</p>

<p>And so today I am very pleased to announce that together, the US and UK are launching a joint prize challenge next year on privacy-enhancing technologies.</p>

<p>These technologies can help democracies unleash the power of data and AI to tackle big societal challenges - from financial crime to the race to Net Zero - while respecting fundamental rights like privacy.</p>

<p>We’re both very hopeful that this new prize challenge will give the R&amp;D of these particular technologies a big boost - and we’re looking forward to updating you all on our progress at next year’s Summit.</p>

<p>By working together on projects like this, democracies can make sure that tech serves citizens, rather than seeking to control them.</p>

<p>Tech is global by its nature. It doesn’t recognise borders - and neither should we.</p>

<p>By teaming up, we can ensure our version of the tech revolution - one that is open and democratic - prevails.</p>

<p>Which is why, as I said at the start, summits like this are so important.</p>

<p>And with that, I’ll hand back to the moderator for the panel session.</p>
