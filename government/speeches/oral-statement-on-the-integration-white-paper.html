<p>Madam Deputy Speaker, with permission, I’d like to make a statement on the Integration White Paper.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has been a living example of the importance of working together as one.</p>

<p>Whether it’s the extraordinary success of the vaccination programme…</p>

<p>…or the work to identify and protect the most vulnerable…</p>

<p>…we were at our best when we were working across traditional boundaries towards a common goal.</p>

<p>We must learn the lessons of the pandemic, and channel this spirit of collaboration.</p>

<p>Although huge progress has been made in bringing together our health and care services and local government…</p>

<p>…our system often remains fragmented…</p>

<p>…and too often fails to deliver joined up services that meet people’s needs.</p>

<p>Thanks to incredible advances in health and care, people are enjoying longer life expectancies…</p>

<p>…but may be living with more complex needs for longer.</p>

<p>Navigating a complex health and care system to meet those needs can be hard…</p>

<p>…especially when services are often funded, managed and delivered separately.</p>

<p>People too often find that they are having to force services to work together…</p>

<p>…rather than experiencing a seamless, joined-up health and care journey.</p>

<p>If we’re to succeed in our goals of levelling up our nation…</p>

<p>…then we must keep working to make integrated health and care a reality across England.</p>

<p>Today we’re publishing the Integration White Paper, which shows how we will get there.</p>

<p>It is the next step in our ambitious programme of reform.</p>

<p>Building on the Health and Care Bill and Social Care Reform White Paper…</p>

<p>…which this Government introduced to the House in December and September.</p>

<p>This White Paper has been shaped by the real-world experience of people…</p>

<p>…as well as nurses, care workers and doctors on the front line…</p>

<p>…drawing on some of the great examples of collaborative working we’ve seen, particularly during the pandemic.</p>

<p>It will help make health and care systems fit for the future…</p>

<p>…boost the health of local communities…</p>

<p>…and make it easier to access health and care services.</p>

<p>It’s a plan with people and outcomes at its heart.</p>

<p>No more endless form-filling…</p>

<p>…no impenetrable processes…</p>

<p>…and no bureaucracy which sees too many people getting lost in the system…</p>

<p>…not receiving the care they need.</p>

<p>First, Madam Deputy Speaker, we will ensure strong leadership and accountability…</p>

<p>…which is critical to delivering integration.</p>

<p>Local leaders have a unique relationship with the people they serve.</p>

<p>Our plans will bring together local leaders to deliver on shared outcomes…</p>

<p>…all in the best interests for their local communities.</p>

<p>And encourage local arrangements that provide clarity over health and care services in each area…</p>

<p>…including aligning and pooling budgets.</p>

<p>This is an arrangement that has already been successfully adopted in several local areas.</p>

<p>We have suggested a model that meets these criteria, and we expect areas to develop appropriate arrangements by Spring of next year.</p>

<p>Local NHS and local authority leaders will be empowered to deliver against these outcomes…</p>

<p>…and will be accountable for delivery and performance against them.</p>

<p>They will be supported by a new national leadership programme…</p>

<p>…addressing the skills required to deliver effective system transformation and strong local collaboration.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker, integration supports transparency.</p>

<p>Joining up NHS and Local Authority data means we can provide better insights to local people about how their area’s health and care services are performing.</p>

<p>And with access to more information, they’ll be more empowered to make decisions about where and how they access care.</p>

<p>There will be a new single accountable person for delivery of a shared health and care plan at local level.</p>

<p>In practice, this could mean an individual with a dual role across health and care…</p>

<p>…or a single lead for a place-based arrangement.</p>

<p>Secondly, Madam Deputy Speaker, we will do more to join up care.</p>

<p>At the moment, too many people are bounced around the system or have to tell their story multiple times to different professionals to get the care they need.</p>

<p>This is frustrating for people and frontline workers alike.</p>

<p>There are so many opportunities here.</p>

<p>Closer working between primary and secondary care can allow care that is closer to home, keeping people healthy and independent for longer…</p>

<p>…and closer working between mental health and social care services can reduce crisis admissions and improve the quality of life for those living with mental illness.</p>

<p>This White Paper sets out how we will get here…</p>

<p>…using the power of data to give local leaders the information they need to establish new, joined-up services…</p>

<p>…to tackle the issues facing their communities.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we will make the best use of the huge advances in digital and data.</p>

<p>We’ve seen throughout the pandemic how digital tools can empower people to look after their health and take greater control of their care…</p>

<p>…For instance, through the NHS app, or remote monitoring technologies.</p>

<p>Where several organisations are involved in one person’s care, there’s a real opportunity to bring together data safely to create a seamless and joined-up experience.</p>

<p>The White Paper reiterates our commitment to having shared records in place for all people by 2024.</p>

<p>Providing local people with a single, functional health and care record…</p>

<p>…that everyone involved in care can access in a secure way.</p>

<p>This will mean every professional having access to the key facts relating to a person’s condition…</p>

<p>…such as their diagnoses and medications.</p>

<p>This will improve care too, with professionals able to make care plans in full knowledge of the facts.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker, we’ve seen a rapid expansion of digital channels in primary and secondary care services in recent years…</p>

<p>…but there’s plenty more we can do.</p>

<p>This year, one million people will be supported by digitally enabled care pathways in the comfort of their home.</p>

<p>This White Paper sets out how we will open up even more ways for people to access health and adult social care services remotely.</p>

<p>We will also support digital transformation by formally recognising the Digital Data and Technology profession within the NHS Agenda for Change…</p>

<p>…and including basic digital, data and technology skills in the training of all health and care staff.</p>

<p>Integrated Care Systems will be tasked with developing digital investment plans…</p>

<p>…so we can make sure that digital capability is strong right across the board.</p>

<p>This means data flowing seamlessly across all care settings with technology transforming care…</p>

<p>…so that it is personalised to the patient.</p>

<p>Finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, the White Paper shows the part that the workforce can play.</p>

<p>The health and care workforce is one of the biggest assets that we have.</p>

<p>We want to make it easier for people working in health and care to feel confident in how the system works together…</p>

<p>…in the best interests of those they care for.</p>

<p>And to feel empowered to progress their careers across the health and care family.</p>

<p>To drive this, Integrated Care Systems will support joint health and care workforce planning.</p>

<p>And we will improve training and ongoing learning and development opportunities for staff.</p>

<p>This means creating more opportunities for joint continuous development and joint roles across health and social care…</p>

<p>…increasing the number of clinical practice placements in adult social care for health undergraduates…</p>

<p>… and exploring the introduction of an Integrated Skills Passport to allow health and care staff to transfer their skills and knowledge between the NHS, public health and social care.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker, this White Paper represents a further step in our journey of reform, building on the foundation laid in the Health and Care Bill.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to a future of health and care in this country with people at its very heart.</p>

<p>It paints a vivid picture of a health and care system with more personalised care…</p>

<p>…greater transparency and choice…</p>

<p>…and where early intervention prevents the most serious diseases.</p>

<p>Using the power of integration to give people the right care, in the right place, at the right time.</p>

<p>I commend this statement to the House.</p>
