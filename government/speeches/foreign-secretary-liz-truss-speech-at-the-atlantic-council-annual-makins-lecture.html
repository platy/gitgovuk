          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Well thank you Ambassador, and thank you to the Atlantic Council for hosting this event at this very important time.</p>

<p>In the late 1990’s I worked for Shell, where one of my first roles was a ship refurbishment project in Norfolk, Virginia, just south of here.</p>

<p>And I was overseeing two LNG vessels that had been mothballed due to lack of demand. Back then in the oil industry we were modelling oil prices at $10 a barrel – today it is heading towards $200 a barrel.</p>

<p>It feels like a different world.</p>

<p>We thought that energy crises, expansionism and geopolitical strife were behind us.</p>

<p>We thought that peace and stability were inevitable – not something that we had to work and invest in.</p>

<p>Now those illusions have been shattered.</p>

<p>And we are paying the price for those years of complacency.</p>

<p>Russia built its capabilities in plain sight, violating its commitments and acting with impunity – in Georgia, in Crimea and beyond.</p>

<p>We knew what Putin was doing.</p>

<p>We had the intelligence and Putin announced his designs on Ukraine in public.</p>

<p>He set his intentions down in black and white and put them up on the Kremlin website. But it was difficult for any of us to believe.</p>

<p>Well, we believe it now.</p>

<p>The world has woken up.</p>

<p>And the era of complacency is over.</p>

<p>We must rise to this moment.</p>

<p>We must pledge that never again will we allow such aggression to go unchecked.</p>

<p>This means acting now. It means being tough – because we know the costs will rise if we don’t.</p>

<p>The public understand the gravity of this moment.</p>

<p>They see the terrible suffering caused by this barbaric and illegal invasion against a European democracy and they recognise that the world has changed.</p>

<p>Putin has launched a full-frontal assault not just on the Ukrainian people, but also on the very foundation of our societies and the rules by which we coexist – sovereignty, democracy, the UN Charter.</p>

<p>He has shaken the architecture of global security.</p>

<p>The invasion of Ukraine is a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11.</p>

<p>And how we respond today will set the pattern for this new era.</p>

<p>If we let Putin’s expansionism go unchallenged it would send a dangerous message to would-be aggressors and authoritarians around the world. And we simply can’t allow that to happen.</p>

<p>We have to start with the principle that the only thing aggressors understand is strength.</p>

<p>And we must work together to ensure that Putin loses in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin thought that his tanks would roll into Kyiv at will.</p>

<p>Instead, he has faced fierce, organised and tenacious resistance.</p>

<p>At Hostomel Airport, in Kharkiv, in Mariupol and beyond, new chapters have been written in the history of valour.</p>

<p>I pay tribute to the bravery of the Ukrainian people and to President Zelensky’s remarkable leadership.</p>

<p>Putin also expected the world to be slow and to be divided.</p>

<p>Instead, he has been met with a resurgence of political unity and strength.</p>

<p>In the UN General Assembly 141 countries voted to condemn Russia’s actions.</p>

<p>Putin’s only supporters were Syria, Eritrea, Belarus and North Korea.</p>

<p>Never did we think that the great nation of Russia would be reduced to this – aside from Eritrea, its only allies are now a vassal state, a rogue state, and a war criminal.</p>

<p>Putin is shunned and isolated. He has made his country a global pariah.</p>

<p>As things get tougher in Ukraine, we will continue to increase our support.</p>

<p>The UK was the first European country to send lethal military aid to Ukraine and we are a top humanitarian donor.</p>

<p>The United States, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Poland, the EU and others have also stepped up.</p>

<p>Our coordinated sanctions were unprecedented and they were overwhelming – cutting off funding for Putin’s war machine and putting him under growing pressure at home.</p>

<p>The fact that the UK, US, EU, Japan and Canada moved in unison gave this action incredible scale.</p>

<p>It has been truly global.</p>

<p>Even Switzerland has put aside its historic neutrality.</p>

<p>Singapore has imposed bilateral sanctions for the first time since the 1970’s.</p>

<p>And in the United Kingdom we have put in place the toughest package of sanctions in our history, hitting over 200 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, including Putin himself.</p>

<p>We’ve hit £300 billion worth of Russian bank assets – more than any other nation.</p>

<p>And this week we changed the law in the United Kingdom to allow us to take even tougher action against oligarchs and others around Putin.</p>

<p>Today we have sanctioned Roman Abramovich and other major oligarchs, showing that we will act without fear and without favour.</p>

<p>This effort has been phenomenal, and it has been united. We have done a huge amount.</p>

<p>But let me be clear – we are still not doing enough.</p>

<p>We must double down and we have to ramp up the global pressure on Putin.</p>

<p>We have to go further on sanctions to tighten the vice– including a full SWIFT ban, freezing all Russian bank assets, and encouraging more countries to join the effort.</p>

<p>We want a situation where they can’t access their funds, they can’t clear their payments, their trade can’t flow, their ships can’t dock and their planes can’t land.</p>

<p>And we must work together to ensure justice is done at the ICC and Putin is held to account for his appalling actions.</p>

<p>And we must do more to deliver defensive weapons and respond to the growing humanitarian emergency.</p>

<p>We will do all of this. And we will shape this new global era for global security.</p>

<p>If we are to persuade Putin and future Putins that we are serious, we need to do things differently.</p>

<p>First of all, we must end the strategic dependence which puts our economies and security at the risk and mercy of malign actors.</p>

<p>Europe remains deeply reliant on Russian energy. This provides a vital source of revenue for Putin – and it must end.</p>

<p>Together with the United States we announced that we will phase out Russian oil imports.</p>

<p>And I welcome the EU’s plan to cut its imports of Russian gas by two thirds this year.</p>

<p>We are working with our G-7 partners to cut this dependence once and for all, to put a ceiling on the percentage of Russian energy imports and committing to bring it down over time.</p>

<p>And we need to look at how we can help those countries especially dependent on Russian energy, and how we can increase supplies elsewhere.</p>

<p>This will require shared commitment, over time.</p>

<p>And it will require greater energy investment in new infrastructure, and for producers to be willing to export more.</p>

<p>I applaud President Biden’s commitment to release 30 million barrels from the US Reserve.</p>

<p>But we must also look at other areas of dependence.</p>

<p>Whether it’s minerals or rare earth metals, we should work to prevent future problems before they emerge.</p>

<p>Secondly, we need to strengthen our deterrence.</p>

<p>In the UK we significantly increased our defence spending last year, ready for this more competitive age, recognising Russia as the most acute threat.</p>

<p>We are NATO’s biggest contributor in Europe.</p>

<p>And we are doubling the number of UK troops in Estonia and Poland.</p>

<p>The United States continues to lead the way on spending in NATO. And others are stepping up – we are seeing a real unity of purpose.</p>

<p>I applaud Germany’s historic decision to up its military spending.</p>

<p>But the fact is we all need to go further.</p>

<p>Many countries still aren’t meeting their target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.</p>

<p>And let’s be clear – that is a minimum.</p>

<p>In the Cold War we were spending far more – upwards of 5%.</p>

<p>We should be ready to do whatever it takes to respond to the challenges of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>We must redouble our efforts to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank.</p>

<p>We have to support non-NATO countries that could be the next target of Putin’s aggression – like our friends in the Caucuses and the Western Balkans.</p>

<p>And we must deepen our partnerships in other areas – like AUKUS, our trilateral partnership with Australia, or our work with Canada and others to boost security in the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>The NATO Strategic Concept and the US National Security Strategy will be vital in pointing the way forward.</p>

<p>We need to ensure that our global security architecture is fit for the new era.</p>

<p>And we must lead a new global consensus where the rules are weakest – in technology, in space and cyber space.</p>

<p>And we have to reinforce and globalize our arms control regimes.</p>

<p>We don’t know where the next threat may arise - and we know that conflict anywhere threatens security everywhere.</p>

<p>Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security are indivisible.</p>

<p>China looms large over this debate.</p>

<p>Beijing is increasing its assertiveness and expanding its armed forces at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>They claim a policy of non-interference.</p>

<p>They claim to respect sovereignty and have refused to support Russia’s aggression at the UN.</p>

<p>We want to see them follow through on those claims.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we need to develop stronger alliances around the world.</p>

<p>The UK is deepening our global economic, diplomatic and security ties. 
And we need to see the entire free world reach out.</p>

<p>We are rallying those 141 countries that voted to condemn Russia’s actions in the UN, and we’re persuading those that abstained to toughen their resolve.</p>

<p>We need to draw more countries into the orbit of those who are prepared to stand up for sovereignty.</p>

<p>In the past we have neglected the strategic importance of some of these countries – including partners in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and the Gulf.</p>

<p>They want alternatives to working with authoritarian regimes who load their balance sheets with debt.</p>

<p>So we have to provide an alternative through British International Investment, America’s initiative, Build Back Better World, and other initiatives from like-minded partners.</p>

<p>And we shouldn’t let anything detract from our unity.</p>

<p>That’s why we must fix the problems of the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<p>All of the signatories of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement share a commitment to peace and stability in Northern Ireland. The UK is firmly opposed to a hard border.</p>

<p>The Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement protects East-West ties as well as North South ties.</p>

<p>At present, however, the protocol is creating an imbalance between communities.</p>

<p>The UK has put forward proposals to enable free trade to flow within the UK at the same time as protecting the EU’s Single Market.</p>

<p>Our objective is that the Protocol can enjoy the support of all communities and ensure that the democratic institutions of Northern Ireland can function.</p>

<p>And we will need increased political will on all sides to make that happen – and pragmatism from the EU.</p>

<p>I want us all to work together to resolve our differences and to be focused on the threats that we face, the immediate threats to European stability and security.</p>

<p>Our ultimate aim – working with all our allies – is to make the world safe for freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>The transatlantic relationship is vital here.</p>

<p>Britain and America have always been at the centre of European and global security – at the centre of a strong G7 with our friends in the EU, Canada, and Japan.</p>

<p>We stand together to face down aggression around the world – from the South China Sea to Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>President Biden and Prime Minister Johnson are seized of this task.</p>

<p>That’s why in Cornwall last year, they signed the New Atlantic Charter.</p>

<p>They promised to renew the architecture of international cooperation for the 21st century.</p>

<p>And they pledged to stand up for democracy, sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

<p>Putin should take note.</p>

<p>We will not rest until he fails in Ukraine and the country’s sovereignty is restored.</p>

<p>Putin must lose, because the consequences if he doesn’t are huge.</p>

<p>So we will keep strengthening our response, replacing doubt with determination, and complacency with conviction.</p>

<p>We must never let our guard down again.</p>

<p>We will be tough - not because we want conflict, but because we want to prevent it.</p>

<p>Be tough, get peace.</p>

<p>In this new era for global security, let that be our rallying call.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
