<p>Can I first say how honoured I am to be opening London Tech Week.</p>

<p>It’s been a baptism of fire. I only took over the role of Digital Secretary on Wednesday - and I’m already here amongst you, three days later, kicking off the biggest tech event in Europe. That’s just quite amazing.</p>

<p>Though I’m a newbie, I know I’m in a room with some of the best tech minds around. And it’s great to see you all in person. I think I’ve taken over this role at just the best time.</p>

<p>And I and everyone else in the government are acutely aware of how important the tech industry is to this country. It’s going to be absolutely essential to our COVID recovery.</p>

<p>But what a time to be here.</p>

<h3>UK tech is booming</h3>

<p>Year after year has seen record-breaking growth - and this morning, my department has just released new stats that show we’ve just smashed all previous records for unicorns - billion dollar tech companies - and for venture capital investment in 2021.</p>

<p>It took us 24 years to create our first 20 unicorns. We’ve already matched that in the first six months of this year.</p>

<p>We now have more than France and Germany combined.</p>

<p>And the UK tech industry has raised £13.5 billion in the first half of the year - almost three times what was invested in the same period last year.</p>

<p>As a proud Scouser - and when I say that sometimes I start talking like this - I’m happy to say it’s not all about London. Every nation and region is seeing growth in their digital economies.</p>

<p>Scotland and Wales are smashing fintech.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland and the Southwest are hotspots for cyber security.</p>

<p>The East Midlands have HealthTech; Yorkshire and the Humber have SpaceTech.</p>

<p>There’s a real buzz across the entire country, and a sense among entrepreneurs and investors that the UK is one of the most welcome environments for tech in the world.</p>

<p>The moment is now - and I’m going to do everything I can to seize it.</p>

<p>So, where do we go from here?</p>

<p>Well, we’ve proven year after year that this is the country to start a trailblazing tech business.</p>

<p>But actually that’s not good enough.</p>

<p>I want all of those businesses to stay in the UK, to grow in the UK, and to become global brands, based right here in the UK.</p>

<p>We’ve cracked start-ups. Now it’s time to go big, and to begin paving the way for a new generation of British tech titans.</p>

<h3>Government measures</h3>

<p>I intend to do a number of things to make that happen.</p>

<p>First, I’m going to listen. I’m going to hear what the people have to say in this room - and across the wider tech industry - and I want to hear the things you think we could do to drive UK tech up to even greater heights.</p>

<p>I already know, for example, that one of the things you most need is stable regulation.</p>

<p>That’s why this government has made it a priority to pull everything we’re doing on tech into one coherent strategy.</p>

<p>We published the Plan for Digital Regulation in July, and that plan sets out our overall vision for tech in the years to come.</p>

<p>Innovation is at the heart of that plan, and I want to work with you to set the right rules for the next era of tech.</p>

<p>And we’re already doing a number of other sensible things to help - like trying to encourage more pension funds to invest in tech, and reviewing the listing rules, which I know has been a very welcome move.</p>

<p>I intend to carry on that good work that has already been achieved.</p>

<p>As your new Digital Secretary, I’ll stand back where I need to - but I’ll also act where I need to.</p>

<p>However, as much as it’s about government doing all those formal things I’ve just mentioned, it’s also about cultural change.</p>

<p>This is a country known for its entrepreneurial spirit. For pioneering discoveries and scientific breakthroughs.</p>

<p>And yet I know that amongst tech entrepreneurs, the UK can still be seen as a bit “stuffy”.</p>

<p>Some institutional investors continue to treat the tech industry with suspicion, or balk at the amount of change the industry is driving.</p>

<p>Well, that era is officially over.</p>

<p>To this government, it doesn’t matter what you look like, it doesn’t matter where you came from. What matters is who you are. You are the entrepreneurs of today.</p>

<p>And we’re on your side, and we’re ready and waiting to celebrate your success with you.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
