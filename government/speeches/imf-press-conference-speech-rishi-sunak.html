<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Let me start by welcoming Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the IMF, and her fantastic team.</p>

<p>I’m grateful for their hard work in providing independent and informed scrutiny of our economic plan and financial stability.</p>

<p>The IMF’s report comes against the uncertain backdrop of the new Omicron variant.</p>

<p>The most important thing we can do to safeguard the economic recovery and protect the British people’s lives and livelihoods, is for everyone to get boosted now.</p>

<p>Doing so will save lives and avoid more stringent restrictions later on.</p>

<p>Now I know this is an uncertain time for many.</p>

<p>That’s why our £400bn Covid support package will continue to help businesses well into spring next year…</p>

<p>…through a set of measures the IMF has today recognised as “impressive, coordinated” and “strong”.</p>

<p>And although the IMF have rightly pointed out that the UK does face real challenges in the months to come, they have also said that:</p>

<p>Our economy is “resilient”; our recovery has been “faster than expected”; and our actions throughout the crisis have “protected jobs and firms”.</p>

<p>New statistics published just this morning show that, compared to before the pandemic, there are now nearly half a million more people in work.</p>

<p>Our economic plan goes further in three crucial areas: to help working people with the cost of living; to stabilise our public finances; and to invest in our future growth.</p>

<p>First, I know people are worried about inflation as they see prices rising in the shops.</p>

<p>So to help with the cost of living, we’re increasing the National Living Wage to £9.50 from April – a pay rise for 2 million people.</p>

<p>Freezing Fuel Duty for the twelfth year running, saving car drivers £15 every time they fill up compared to pre-2010 plans.</p>

<p>And giving nearly 2 million families an extra £1,000 a year through the cut to the Universal Credit taper and increased work allowances.</p>

<p>Second, we’re acting responsibly to put the public finances back on a sustainable path.</p>

<p>The IMF has strongly endorsed the new fiscal rules I set out at Budget, saying they have “anchored fiscal policy well”.</p>

<p>Thanks to the difficult decisions we’ve taken, our deficit is expected to stabilise and our national debt to fall.</p>

<p>And their comments on our fiscal policy are a crucial reminder: we must stick to the Government’s existing public spending plans.</p>

<p>And third, I’m pleased that the IMF has welcomed our Plan for Growth, calling it “comprehensive” and backed by “significant amounts of funding”.</p>

<p>We’re making this country a science superpower with a commitment to spend £20bn on R&amp;D by 2024-25.</p>

<p>Investing over £130bn in economic infrastructure like roads, railways, broadband and mobile networks.</p>

<p>Increasing spending on skills to £3.8bn including the PM’s lifetime skills guarantee for 11m adults.</p>

<p>And helping hundreds of thousands of people get good, well-paid work through our Plan for Jobs.</p>

<p>It’s always been clear that the road to recovery from such an unprecedented economic shock was never going to be smooth.</p>

<p>The IMF have rightly reminded us of some of the dangers that lie ahead.</p>

<p>But people should be reassured that the IMF have also said we are entering this period of uncertainty with a resilient economic foundation.</p>

<p>And that we have the right plans in place to help families and businesses with the cost of living;</p>

<p>Get the public finances back on track;</p>

<p>And invest in the things that will grow our economy over the long term.</p>

<p>So thank you again to the IMF team.</p>

<p>Let me hand over to Kristalina, for her remarks and to take your questions.</p>
