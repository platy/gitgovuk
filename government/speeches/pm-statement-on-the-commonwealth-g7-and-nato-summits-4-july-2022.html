<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>with your permission I will make a statement about the NATO, G7 and Commonwealth summits,</p>

<p>held in Madrid, Schloss Elmau and Kigali respectively.</p>

<p>In the space of seven days, I had the opportunity to work alongside more than 80 governments</p>

<p>– nearly half the entire membership of the United Nations –</p>

<p>and hold bilateral talks with over 25 leaders,</p>

<p>ranging from the new Presidents of South Korea and Zambia to the Prime Ministers of Japan and Jamaica,</p>

<p>demonstrating the global reach of British diplomacy,</p>

<p>and the value of our presence at the world’s top tables.</p>

<p>Our immediate priority is to join with our allies</p>

<p>to ensure that Ukraine prevails in her brave struggle against Putin’s aggression.</p>

<p>At the Madrid summit, NATO exceeded all expectations</p>

<p>in the unity and single-minded resolve of the Alliance</p>

<p>to support Ukraine for as long as it takes</p>

<p>and to explode the myth that Western democracies lack the staying power for a prolonged crisis.</p>

<p>All of us understand that if Putin is not stopped in Ukraine,</p>

<p>he will find new targets for his revanchistcattacks</p>

<p>and we are not defending some abstract ideal,</p>

<p>but the first principle of a peaceful world</p>

<p>which is that large and powerful countries cannot be allowed to dismember their neighbours,</p>

<p>and if this was ever permitted,</p>

<p>then no nation anywhere would be safe.</p>

<p>Therefore our goal must be for our Ukrainian friends to win,</p>

<p>by which I mean that Ukraine must have the strength to finish this war on the terms that President Zelenskyy has described.</p>

<p>And when Putin claimed that by invading his neighbour he would force NATO away from Russia,</p>

<p>he could not have been proved more spectacularly wrong,</p>

<p>because the single most welcome outcome of the Madrid summit</p>

<p>was the Alliance’s agreement to admit Finland and Sweden.</p>

<p>I hope I speak for the whole House when I say that Britain will be proud to stand alongside these fellow democracies</p>

<p>and reaffirm our unshakeable pledge to come to their aid</p>

<p>and defend them if ever necessary,</p>

<p>just as they would for us.</p>

<p>We were glad to smooth their path into NATO by giving both nations the security assurances they needed to apply for membership</p>

<p>and when I met Prime Minister Andersson of Sweden and President Niinistö of Finland last Wednesday,</p>

<p>I told them I was certain that NATO would be stronger and safer for their accession.</p>

<p>Before Putin’s onslaught, both countries had prized their neutrality,</p>

<p>even through all the crises of the Cold War,</p>

<p>and it is a measure of how seriously they take today’s threat,</p>

<p>that opinion in Sweden and Finland has been transformed,</p>

<p>and it speaks volumes about Putin’s folly</p>

<p>that one permanent consequence of his attack on Ukraine</p>

<p>will be a doubling of the length of NATO’s border with Russia.</p>

<p>If anyone needed proof that NATO is purely defensive,</p>

<p>the fact that two quintessentially peaceable countries should have chosen to join</p>

<p>demonstrates the true nature of our Alliance.</p>

<p>And now is the time to intensify our help for Ukraine because Putin’s Donbas offensive is slowing down,</p>

<p>and his overstretched army is suffering heavy casualties,</p>

<p>and Ukraine’s success in forcing the Russians off Snake Island by sheer weight of firepower,</p>

<p>shows how difficult the invader will find it</p>

<p>to hold the territory he has overrun.</p>

<p>We need to equip our friends now to take advantage of the moment when Putin will have to pause and regroup,</p>

<p>So Britain will supply Ukraine with another £1 billion of military aid,</p>

<p>including air defences, drones and electronic warfare equipment,</p>

<p>bringing our total military, humanitarian and economic support since 24th February to nearly £4 billion.</p>

<p>And to guarantee the security of our allies on the eastern flank,</p>

<p>NATO agreed in Madrid to bolster its high readiness forces</p>

<p>and we in the UK will offer even more British forces to the Alliance,</p>

<p>including almost all of our surface fleet.</p>

<p>We have already doubled our deployment in Estonia</p>

<p>and we will upgrade our national headquarters to be led by a Brigadier</p>

<p>and help our Estonian friends to establish their own divisional headquarters.</p>

<p>If you follow the trajectory of our programmes to modernise our armed forces,</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>you will draw the logical conclusion that the UK will likely be spending 2.5 percent of GDP on defence by the end of this decade.</p>

<p>Earlier, at the G7 summit, the first full day of talks coincided with a Russian missile destroying a Ukrainian shopping centre,</p>

<p>killing at least 18 people.</p>

<p>This barbaric attack on an obviously civilian target strengthened the resolve of my fellow leaders</p>

<p>to provide Ukraine with more financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic backing for</p>

<p>– and I quote the communique again–</p>

<p>“as long as it takes”,</p>

<p>exactly the term later echoed by NATO.</p>

<p>The G7 has pledged nearly $30 billion of financial support for Ukraine this year</p>

<p>and we will tighten our sanctions on Russia</p>

<p>and the UK will join America, Japan and Canada to ban the import of Russian gold,</p>

<p>which previously raised more export revenues than anything else except hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>The G7 will devise more options for ensuring that nearly 25 million tonnes of grain,</p>

<p>trapped inside Ukraine by Putin’s blockade,</p>

<p>reaches the countries that rely on these supplies.</p>

<p>Just as the world economy was recovering from the pandemic,</p>

<p>Putin’s war has caused a surge in global food and energy prices,</p>

<p>raising the cost of living everywhere, including here at home.</p>

<p>The G7 agreed - and I quote – to “take immediate action to secure energy supply and reduce price surges…. including by exploring additional measures such as price caps”.</p>

<p>And we will help our partners in the developing world to meet their climate targets and transform millions of lives</p>

<p>by constructing new infrastructure</p>

<p>according to the highest standards of transparency and environmental protection.</p>

<p>Through our Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment</p>

<ul>
  <li>an idea launched by the UK at the Carbis Bay summit last year -</li>
</ul>

<p>we will mobilise up to $600 billion of public and private investment over the next five years.</p>

<p>Many beneficiary nations will be members of the Commonwealth,</p>

<p>and I was delighted to attend the summit in Kigali of this unique association of 56 states, encompassing a third of humanity.</p>

<p>More countries are eager to join</p>

<p>and we were pleased to welcome two new members in Gabon and Togo.</p>

<p>It is an amazing fact that our familiar legal and administrative systems,</p>

<p>combined with the English language,</p>

<p>knock 21 percent off the cost of trade between Commonwealth members.</p>

<p>And it is because the Commonwealth unites that advantage</p>

<p>with some of the fastest-growing markets in the world</p>

<p>that we are using the sovereignty the UK has regained</p>

<p>to sign free trade or economic partnership agreements with as many Commonwealth countries as possible.</p>

<p>So far we’ve done 33, including Australia and New Zealand,</p>

<p>and we’re aiming for India by Diwali in October.</p>

<p>But it’s true that not every member of the Commonwealth sees Putin’s aggression as we do,</p>

<p>or exactly as we do,</p>

<p>and it was vital to have the opportunity to counter the myths</p>

<p>and point out that food prices are rising because Putin has blockaded one of the world’s biggest food-producers,</p>

<p>and if large countries are free to destroy their neighbours</p>

<p>then no Commonwealth member, however distant from Ukraine,</p>

<p>would be genuinely secure.</p>

<p>The fact that in a week, the UK was able to deal on friendly terms with scores of countries in three organisations</p>

<p>shows the extraordinary diplomatic assets our country possesses</p>

<p>and as we stand up for what is right in Ukraine,</p>

<p>and advance the values and interests of the British people,</p>

<p>I commend this statement to the House.</p>
