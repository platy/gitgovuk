          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Thank you Mr President. And thank you in particular for your clear account of the impact of climate change and terrorism in Niger and I thank the other experts too for their valuable briefings.</p>

<p>It is a cruel reality that many of the nations most affected by the climate change are also among the world’s most fragile.</p>

<p>As the Secretary-General made clear the impacts of climate change act as a multiplier of threats already facing vulnerable populations. Countries enduring conflict are hit especially hard.</p>

<p>With institutions under pressure, communities displaced, societies insecure, these nations are less equipped to cope with the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>As you highlighted Mr President, in the Sahel, changes in rainfall have fuelled conflict between farmer and herder communities. This can create the conditions for violent extremism.</p>

<p>In Iraq and Syria, farming communities affected by climate- induced crop failures and droughts were thought to have been an important source of recruits for ISIL between 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p>We therefore welcome the UN’s efforts to address both terrorism and climate change.</p>

<p>With the climate crisis posing an existential threat to our future - not only to our environment, but to our common security - we must act.</p>

<p>I want to emphasise three ways we can do this.</p>

<p>First at COP26, we saw that countries can work together to deliver ambitious commitments.</p>

<p>Through the Glasgow Climate Pact, we have kept alive the hope of limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees.</p>

<p>We saw strong commitments made at COP on net zero, ending and reversing deforestation, the doubling of adaptation finance and meeting the $100 billion goal by 2023 at the latest.</p>

<p>This will help countries increase their preparedness to climate risks and protect vulnerable communities from some of the worst impacts of climate change and its effects on stability.</p>

<p>Second, we need the UN system to report comprehensively on the links between climate and security, so we have the best information to inform our decisions.</p>

<p>The Council’s Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate has a clear role here and should continue to examine the conditions and environments in which terrorism develops and thrives.</p>

<p>But all arms of the UN, including the Security Council, have a critical role to play to meet this challenge. Therefore, we support the resolution put before this Council as an important first step.</p>

<p>Third, we whole heartedly support a fully inclusive approach in particular with women and girls who suffer disproportionately from conflict and from climate change to play a meaningful role.</p>

<p>In conclusion Mr President we must act effectively, urgently and together, to address the climate crisis and reduce the increasing risks of climate insecurity.</p>

<p>I thank you.</p>
