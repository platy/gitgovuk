          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Mr Speaker. I rise to make a statement on the fightback against this virus.</p>

<p>Across the country, our vaccine roll-out continues at pace.</p>

<p>With each vaccine we administer, we are one step closer to normal.</p>

<p>And as of today, we’ve vaccinated 9.2 million people.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone involved in this collective national effort that saw nearly a million people get vaccinations last weekend alone – or, put another way, one in 60 of the UK’s adults.</p>

<p>We’ve now protected almost 9 out of every 10 people over 80 and over half of people in their 70s.</p>

<p>I’m also delighted we’ve visited every eligible care home – 10,307 in total.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone involved in that effort – including the NHS, our dedicated staff in social care and the residents themselves – for coming forward.</p>

<p>And I also want to pay tribute to my honourable friend, the Minister of State for Care, who has worked so hard to help us meet this ambitious target.</p>

<p>I know many of us in this House are playing our part in the national vaccination effort, and today we published a new resource for the House that provides more information on the vaccine roll-out and how all colleagues can play such an important part in increasing the take-up of the vaccine in their area.</p>

<p>Because the take-up of this vaccine will directly impact how effective the vaccines are and how fast we can safely get out of this.</p>

<h2>Vaccine supply</h2>

<p>Mr Speaker, we’re confident we have the supplies to meet our target to offer the vaccine to the 4 most vulnerable groups by 15 February.</p>

<p>We now have over 400 million doses of vaccine on order, including the additional 40 million vaccine doses from Valneva we ordered yesterday.</p>

<p>And, Mr Speaker, that we find ourselves in this position is no accident.</p>

<p>Our strategy has been to invest early – and invest at risk.</p>

<p>We’ve backed many horses – no matter where they’re from.</p>

<p>We’ve also built up our vaccine manufacturing capability here at home.</p>

<p>As a result, today we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the AstraZeneca jab being manufactured in Oxford, Staffordshire and Wrexham</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Novovax vaccine made in Teesside</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and the Valneva vaccine manufactured in Livingston in Scotland</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a great example of what we can achieve together, working as one United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>South African variant</h2>

<p>Mr Speaker, despite this optimistic backdrop, we must continue to act with caution, not least, because of the renewed challenges posed by new variants of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>We have now found here 105 cases of the variant first identified in South Africa, including 11 cases which do not appear to have any links to international travel.</p>

<p>As with the variant first identified in the UK, there’s currently no evidence to suggest it is any more severe.</p>

<p>But we have to come down on it hard.</p>

<p>Our mission must be to stop its spread altogether – and break those chains of transmission.</p>

<p>In those areas where this variant has been found – parts of Broxbourne, London, Maidstone, Southport, Walsall and Woking – we’re also putting in extra testing, and sequencing every positive test.</p>

<p>Working with local authorities, we’re going door-to-door to test everyone in those areas.</p>

<p>And mobile testing units will be deployed, offering PCR tests to people who have to leave their home for work or other essential reasons.</p>

<p>We have also seen 11 cases of mutations of concern in Bristol, 32 in Liverpool – and are taking the same approach.</p>

<p>In all these areas, it is imperative that you must stay at home and only leave home where it is absolutely essential.</p>

<p>When your local authority offers you a test, you should take up the offer because we know that around one in 3 people with coronavirus have no symptoms – but can still pass it on.</p>

<p>We are offering testing to everyone aged 16 and over – even if you have been vaccinated.</p>

<p>And if you live in one of those areas but have not been contacted, and you’re unsure if you should have a test, I encourage you to visit your local authority website to find out.</p>

<p>Anyone who must leave your home to go to a workplace – for instance, because they cannot work from home – should get tested.</p>

<p>All local employers should support and encourage their workers to get tested.</p>

<p>The message is more important than ever: to stay at home, maintain social distancing and get tested.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, across the whole country, we’re expanding workplace testing, including here in Parliament itself.</p>

<p>This morning you and I visited the new COVID testing site here in Parliament, which offers all those who work here – MPs, peers and staff – the chance to get tested.</p>

<p>I took a test this morning – thankfully, negative. It’s quick, easy – and you get the result back fast.</p>

<p>And I encourage colleagues who have to be here in person to sign up and do the same.</p>

<p>And for all of us, no matter where we live, we need to continue to follow those rules.</p>

<p>Because, while more scientific work is underway to learn more about new variants, we know – with absolute certainty – that social distancing works.</p>

<p>It denies the virus the social contact it needs to spread.</p>

<p>We must all keep at it.</p>

<p>We’ve all sacrificed too much – and come so far with the vaccine – to give up now.</p>

<p>And I know we that won’t.</p>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>Mr Speaker, while we have been working night and day to fight coronavirus, I have often drawn inspiration from our fight against another killer pandemic: HIV.</p>

<p>A disease that also took too many people before their time.</p>

<p>This is HIV Test Week.</p>

<p>It’s a reminder of how important it is to get your free HIV test.</p>

<p>But it’s also a reminder of the progress we’ve made in tackling that terrible pandemic, that we can credibly commit to no new transmissions by the end of this decade.</p>

<p>And today, I’m sure the whole House will join me in wishing Lord Norman Fowler a very happy 83rd birthday.</p>

<p>He was an inspirational former Health Secretary and fearless advocate for tackling HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p>Lord Fowler is someone who knows the importance of taking action early, and the power of testing to turn the tide.</p>

<p>So, as we face these difficult weeks ahead, we can all draw inspiration from that great struggle: that even when you’re facing a mountain of challenges, science, ingenuity and sheer power of will can see us to better days.</p>

<p>I commend this statement to the House.</p>
