<p>Today is <a rel="external" href="https://purpletuesday.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Purple Tuesday</a>, a day dedicated to ensuring that the needs of disabled people, as valued consumers, are properly recognised and that they receive the best levels of customer service.</p>

<p>As the Minister with the Department for Transport responsible for accessible transport, I am determined that the transport network deliver an equally first-class experience to disabled people. The challenges disabled people face when using our transport system are well documented and, whilst good progress has been made, I recognise there is still more to do.</p>

<p>I want to see continued steps being taken to improve disabled people’s experience accessing transport. I also want to see our ambition for a fully inclusive and accessible transport network by 2030 – with assistance if infrastructure remains a barrier – realised. I am equally determined that the current pandemic and its after-effects will not limit our ambition to achieve this.</p>

<p>Thus, I am pleased to help mark Purple Tuesday by announcing further progress on delivering our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-transport-strategy" class="govuk-link">Inclusive Transport Strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The strategy was published in 2018, setting out an ambitious programme for transforming the transport system, and today I am publishing a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-transport-strategy/the-inclusive-transport-strategy-summary-of-progress" class="govuk-link">report detailing what has been delivered in the past 2 years</a>.</p>

<p>In the last year, we have, for example, published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-guidance-notes-relating-to-regulation-eu-no-1177-2010/maritime-passenger-rights-industry-toolkit" class="govuk-link">passenger rights toolkit</a>, which provides guidance to maritime operators on how to comply with passenger rights regulations, and launched the <a rel="external" href="https://everyonesjourney.campaign.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">‘It’s everyone’s journey’ public awareness campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside the update on the Inclusive Transport Strategy, I am also announcing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the first set of operators who have successfully applied to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/inclusive-transport-leaders-scheme" class="govuk-link">Inclusive Transport Leaders Scheme</a>, which allows operators to receive formal recognition for the positive actions they are taking to improve disabled passengers’ experiences of using the transport system, and to encourage others to follow</li>
  <li>a disability equality awareness training package that we are making available, free of charge, for all transport operators; this will ensure that all transport operators, big and small, can access a common standard of disability training for their staff</li>
  <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-funding-for-accessibility-as-government-reports-progress-for-disabled-people-across-transport-network" class="govuk-link">funding competition</a>, which will enable businesses to bid for grant funding to develop products or services that will improve the travel experience for disabled people</li>
</ul>

<p>I am grateful to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disabled-persons-transport-advisory-committee" class="govuk-link">Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee</a> and representatives of disabled peoples’ organisations who continue to hold both myself and the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> to account for the delivery of the Inclusive Transport Strategy, and I look forward to continuing to work with them as the strategy enters its third year.</p>

<p>Copies of this letter and the report on the progress of the Inclusive Transport Strategy have been placed in the library of both Houses.</p>
