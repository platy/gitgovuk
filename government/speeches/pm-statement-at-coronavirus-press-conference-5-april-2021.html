<p>Good afternoon, I hope you’re all continuing to enjoy the Easter break,</p>

<p>and I know that over this weekend millions of people have been able to see loved ones for the first time in months.</p>

<p>And I want to thank you all again for your patience,</p>

<p>because it is really clear now that this is paying off.</p>

<p>And it your collective efforts, our collective efforts, that has given us that crucial time and space to vaccinate more than 31 million people.</p>

<p>And I’m pleased that we’ve also been able to support our overseas territories</p>

<p>so that Gibraltar has become one of the first places in the world to offer a vaccination to its entire adult population.</p>

<p>And the net result of your efforts and the vaccine roll-out is that I can today confirm that from Monday 12th April, we will move to Step Two of our roadmap -</p>

<p>re-opening shops, gyms, zoos, holiday campsites, personal care services like hairdressers and, of course, beer gardens and outdoor hospitality of all kinds.</p>

<p>And on Monday the 12th I will be going to the pub myself - and cautiously but irreversibly raising a pint of beer to my lips.</p>

<p>We’re also increasing the number of visitors to care homes from one to two – to allow residents to see more of their loved ones.</p>

<p>We think that these changes are fully justified by the data</p>

<p>which show we are meeting our four tests for easing the lockdown as Chris will shortly explain.</p>

<p>But – and you know I’m going to say this – we can’t be complacent.</p>

<p>We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries</p>

<p>and we’ve seen how this story goes.</p>

<p>We still don’t know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as I’m afraid that they will –</p>

<p>and that’s why we’re saying:</p>

<p>Please get your vaccine or your second dose when your turn comes.</p>

<p>And please use the free NHS tests – even if you don’t feel ill, because remember 1 in 3 people with this virus doesn’t have any symptoms -</p>

<p>and you can get these tests from pharmacies or your local test site,</p>

<p>you can even order them <a href="https://www.gov.uk/getting-tested-for-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">on gov.uk</a> and get home deliveries.</p>

<p>As part of our roadmap we’re also publishing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021-reviews-terms-of-reference/roadmap-reviews-update">today on gov.uk the early thinking on our four reviews</a>, on the safe return of major events, on social distancing, the potential role of Covid status certification, and on the resumption of international travel.</p>

<p>We set out our roadmap and we’re sticking to it.</p>

<p>And I want to stress, that we see nothing in the present data that makes us think that we will have to deviate from that roadmap.</p>

<p>But it is by being cautious,</p>

<p>by monitoring the data at every stage</p>

<p>and by following the rules: remembering hands, face, space and fresh air -</p>

<p>that we hope together to make this roadmap to freedom irreversible.</p>
