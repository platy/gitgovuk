<p>Today the national vaccination programme continues to power past the target we set six weeks ago with more than 15 million people vaccinated across the UK.</p>

<p>And once again I pay tribute to the astonishing efforts of everyone involved – the GPs, the nurses, the volunteers, the army and the pharmacists like Hardik Desai - who rallied local volunteers to vaccinate 3,000 people in his village hall in Ticehurst in Sussex, while keeping his pharmacy open - and of course I thank all of you who have come forward to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>This is an unprecedented national achievement but it’s no moment to relax and in fact it’s the moment to accelerate because the threat from this virus remains very real.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s true, we have vaccinated more than 90 per cent of those aged over 70 but don’t forget that 60 per cent of hospital patients with Covid are under 70.</p>

<p>And although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don’t have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the spread of infection.</p>

<p>We have some interesting straws in the wind. We have grounds for confidence. But the vaccinations have only been running for a matter of weeks - and while we are learning the whole time - we don’t today have all the hard facts that we need.</p>

<p>And the level of infection remains very high, with more people still in hospital today than at the peak last April and admissions running at 1,600 a day.</p>

<p>So we have to keep our foot to the floor. And I can tell you today that the next million letters are landing on people’s mats right now, offering appointments to the over-65s and we are also contacting all those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers.</p>

<p>And if we can keep this pace up – and if we can keep supply steady – and I hope and believe we can - then we hope to offer a vaccination to everyone in the first nine priority groups – including everyone over 50 – by the end of April.</p>

<p>And at the same time we will be giving second doses to millions of the most vulnerable within twelve weeks of the first.</p>

<p>So this moment is a huge step forward but it’s only a first step.</p>

<p>And while it shows what the country can do we must be both optimistic but also patient.</p>

<p>And next week I will be setting out a roadmap saying as much as we possibly can about the route to normality even though some things are very uncertain.</p>

<p>Because we want this lockdown to be the last. And we want progress to be cautious but also irreversible.</p>

<p>So please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
