<p>Excellencies, colleagues, friends.</p>

<p>The Sustainable Development Goals remain the most important to-do list in the history of humankind.</p>

<p>Yet President Putin’s illegal and senseless invasion of Ukraine has pushed the SDGs further from our reach. He has caused a humanitarian catastrophe and sent global food and energy prices rocketing, impeding the global recovery from COVID and pushing the most vulnerable to the cliff edge.</p>

<p>Despite these setbacks, the UK Government remains committed to meeting the SDGs by 2030, as we have set out in our new International Development Strategy.</p>

<p>We will continue to prioritise humanitarian need, committing $3.7 billion in humanitarian assistance over the next 3 years.</p>

<p>This will allow us to help the people in greatest need and most at risk, as we have this year with our commitment of $352 million to support over 4.4 million Afghans.</p>

<p>With our partners we will anticipate and prevent future shocks, tackling the underlying drivers of crises, instability and extreme food insecurity.</p>

<p>Our investments in research, innovation and access to vaccines will reduce threats to global health, and drive breakthroughs in health systems and health security.</p>

<p>To broaden economic growth, enhance peace and security, and advance equality, we are putting women and girls at the heart of our foreign and development policy.</p>

<p>We are leading global efforts to give all girls access to 12 years of quality education. The Transforming Education Summit must help make this a reality.</p>

<p>We are empowering women and girls by unlocking their social, economic, and political potential, and by standing up for their bodily autonomy.</p>

<p>And we are championing action to end all forms of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence.</p>

<p>Climate change and nature loss remain urgent, existential threats. Our security and prosperity rely on a transition to Net Zero.</p>

<p>Our planet needs us to deliver on the commitments made at COP26. The window to keep 1.5 degrees alive is closing fast.</p>

<p>Everyone must step up to implement the Glasgow Climate Pact ahead of COP27. This means revisiting and strengthening NDCs; Long Term Strategies aligned to Net Zero; and developed countries doubling their adaptation finance by 2025.</p>

<p>We need an ambitious and transformative global biodiversity framework at CBD this December, including the global 30 by 30 goal, stronger accountability and the finance needed for implementation.</p>

<p>The UK Government will also deliver over $9.5 billion of development investment a year by 2025, through British International Investment - our new development finance institution.</p>

<p>This will support countries to build green, secure and open thriving economies as part of our British Investment Partnerships offer.</p>

<p>Collaboration between government and the private sector will unlock enormous advances in our efforts to finance the SDGs.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to lose focus from Agenda 2030 and the SDGs.</p>

<p>So let’s work together, and all play our part in ensuring no one is left behind.</p>
