<p>The United Kingdom remains open to discussions on improving penholding. We welcome these discussions being taken forward shortly within the Informal Working Group on documentation and other procedural matters.</p>

<p>Colleagues, the penholding convention we know today is still relatively new.&nbsp; As mandated missions grew and files became more complex, the current approach evolved to provide efficiency, continuity and predictability.</p>

<p>This flexible and informal approach means that anyone can penhold and there are different ways of doing it.&nbsp; Indeed we have seen many valuable products initiated by elected members, particularly during their presidencies – such as on peacekeeping, WPS, climate security and protection of civilians.</p>

<p>We have also been open to co-penholding to enhance the process and have done so recently with Germany on Sudan and Libya sanctions and with Gabon on UNOCA.</p>

<p>The UK’s approach to penholding reflects a deep sense of responsibility for the Council’s role of addressing conflict and human suffering through proactive and practical action, and its mandate to address threats to international peace and security.</p>

<p>We strive to balance differing views. To reach consensus the UK has to go against our own national position.&nbsp; For example the fourth 3 month extension of the UNSMIL mandate last month; and the technical rollover of UNITAMS/Sudan mandate in June. The last time a UK-drafted resolution did not reach nine positive votes was in 1976.</p>

<p>Colleagues, the objective of improving working methods is surely for improving better outcomes, including Council products.</p>

<p>What underpins penholding it is what underpins all Council negotiations: the willingness of all of us to collaborate, listen and bridge national positions for the greater good.</p>

<p>But there is another approach pursued by the Russian Federation. Not engaging in negotiations, then tabling alternative texts for a vote, without taking into account the views of most Council members, is not consistent with this spirit of collaboration.&nbsp; Such showdowns are not best practice.</p>

<p>We note that the Russian Federation has initiated texts themselves, on Libya, WPS and on the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.&nbsp; These were not successful because they refused to take account of other views to reach consensus.</p>

<p>Colleagues, Note 507 - agreed recently in 2017 - sets out helpful guidance for enhancing ‘the full participation of Council members in the preparation of Council documents’.</p>

<p>The UK strives to take a professional, transparent, consensus-based, collaborative approach to enable all stakeholders time to articulate their views. Consulting the host government and the region early is critical for us. &nbsp; For example, the two technical rollovers of AMISOM in 2021 and 2022 ensured African partners and the African Union were ready to engage on a substantive reconfiguration of the mission.</p>

<p>We welcome further suggestions for how the process can be improved further and look forward to constructive discussions in the IWG.</p>

<p>Finally colleagues, it needs no reminding that Russia has convened this discussion today on working methods while their invasion of Ukraine - now six months in -&nbsp; remains in flagrant breach of the UN Charter – the very foundation that underpins everything the Council does and how it functions.</p>
