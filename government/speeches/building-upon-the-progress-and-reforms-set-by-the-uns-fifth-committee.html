<p>Thank you Mr Chair,</p>

<p>Firstly, given the gravity of the situation, like others, I want to acknowledge what is happening in Ukraine.
Russia’s assault is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. The UK and our international partners stand united in condemning the Russian government’s reprehensible actions, which are an egregious violation of international law and the UN Charter. We condemn the Russian Federation’s increasing use of heavy weapons, including the use of cluster munitions in population centres, and yesterday’s attack on the largest nuclear power station in Europe. We welcome the clear message contained in the General Assembly resolution passed on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Russia must urgently de-escalate and withdraw its troops. It must be held accountable and stop undermining democracy, global stability, and international law.</p>

<p>Mr. Chair,</p>

<p>Turning to the Fifth Committee, let me begin by congratulating Pakistan for assuming Chairpersonship of the Group of 77 and China. We look forward to working constructively with you and your group, and thank the previous Chair, Guinea for their engagement.</p>

<p>The reforms this Committee agreed previously have helped the UN respond more effectively to two of the most challenging years in recent history. We once again have the opportunity to ensure the Organisation is equipped to deliver relevant, system-wide and cost-effective solutions to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Let us make the most of that opportunity this session.</p>

<p>Mr. Chair,</p>

<p>It has been over four years since this committee has provided guidance on the UN’s efforts to strengthen its human resources management. It is our responsibility to ensure that the UN and its staff have modern, fit for purpose human resources policies. We hope to make progress on this important issue and will make further comments next week.</p>

<p>Strengthening the accountability system, and improving transparency, is central to an effectively managed United Nations. We look forward to discussing progress and how we can enhance a culture of accountability at all levels.</p>

<p>Mr. Chair,</p>

<p>We were delighted to hear from the Secretary General that the UN’s financial situation has improved. Our move to realign UK payments to the UN financial year will hopefully have contributed to that, and we encourage others to do the same.</p>

<p>Reforms agreed three years ago continue to have a positive impact on the financial health of peacekeeping operations, including more timely payments to troop and police contributing states. We hope we can consolidate and build on those reforms to address remaining challenges, in particular for the regular budget.</p>

<p>We look forward to making progress on After Service Health Insurance, which is also important for the long-term financial health of the organisation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chair,</p>

<p>The past two years have demonstrated that integrated, agile and responsive supply chains and cost-effective, transparent, procurement activities are crucial for efficient mandate implementation, as well as supporting the health of personnel.</p>

<p>The Secretariat’s focus on the entire supply chain - and transition to a circular supply chain - supports efficiency and sustainability. UN supply chain activities should reduce climate impacts and support the Agenda 2030, in line with best value and UN procurement principles, and across the three dimensions of sustainability – economic, environmental and social.</p>

<p>Mr. Chair,</p>

<p>The UN Support Mission in Libya plays an important role in protecting peace and security in Libya. The new ceasefire mechanism is critical to supporting a fragile security environment and keeping the political process on track. We must ensure adequate, cost effective resourcing in support of full mandate delivery, including swift onboarding of ceasefire monitors.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Chair, you have our full support as we seek to make tangible progress this session.</p>
