<p>Like many Asian parents, my mum always wanted me to be a GP.</p>

<p>When I told her I’d been made Health and Social Care Secretary, she said: “Well, you didn’t quite make it to GP, but at least you’re working in healthcare!”</p>

<p>In truth, she was only half joking. There’s a reason why people such as my mum have such high regard for GPs: their powerful blend of expertise and empathy has made generations of communities happier and healthier.</p>

<p>So I want to say a huge thank you to GPs and their teams across the country for their commitment to patients during the most challenging of times.</p>

<p>I may not have become a GP, but I do want to make it easier for them to do their vital work.
Equally, I am committed to making sure patients can see their GP in the way they choose and have a better experience when they do. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9558165/Mail-Sunday-leads-campaign-make-GPs-patients-face-face-again.html">The Mail has run an important campaign on this issue.</a></p>

<p>Working closely with the NHS, we’ve made a plan for GPs and patients to do just that: it will mean more appointments in the ways people want.</p>

<p>While I’m determined to get us closer to pre-pandemic levels of face-to-face appointments, it is, of course, true that online and telephone consultations are more convenient for many people.</p>

<p>There’s no question that telephone and video calls will be a part of the future of general practice. But it cannot be the whole future.</p>

<p>With winter just around the corner, I know GPs are under real pressure: the demand for appointments is high and so is their workload.</p>

<p>So today, I’m announcing a fresh £250 million investment in general practice to boost capacity ahead of the winter, opening up more appointments.</p>

<p>With this money, we will expect GPs to provide clear plans for how they will improve access and deliver more face-to-face appointments, such as offering appointments on evenings and weekends.</p>

<p>By and large, people understand why it’s been a difficult time for our GPs: coronavirus (COVID-19) pressures, concerns about infection and reduced space in waiting rooms have often made the process of getting an appointment more difficult.</p>

<p>While I understand the frustration, violence and abuse towards GPs and their teams will never be tolerated.</p>

<p>GPs and their teams need to feel safe at work, and the NHS is making £5 million available for practices to improve their security measures as part of our plan.</p>

<p>Another way we’re going to ensure more time is spent with patients is by spreading the workload.</p>

<p>I want every practice to use the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/primary-care/pharmacy/community-pharmacist-consultation-service/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Community Pharmacy Consultation Service</a>, so our brilliant community pharmacists can do more in terms of prescribing.</p>

<p>I’m asking my department to work with the NHS and look at a ‘Pharmacy First’ scheme for England, so pharmacists can provide treatment for specific conditions such as sore throats, without patients having to go to their GP – building on pilot schemes in England and much as they already do in Scotland.</p>

<p>We also need to measure GPs against clearer standards. The vast majority of GPs are doing brilliant work but, where GPs are not, we have to fix it: it’s simply not fair for their patients to suffer in silence.</p>

<p>The challenges in general practice are far from over, but I have every confidence we can meet the difficulties ahead by working together to achieve our common goal – delivering for patients.</p>
