<p>Good afternoon everybody,</p>

<p>It is now clearly the will of the parliamentary conservative party that there should be a new leader of that party</p>

<p>and therefore a new Prime Minister</p>

<p>and I have agreed with Sir Graham Brady</p>

<p>the chairman of our backbench MPs</p>

<p>that the process of choosing that new leader should begin now</p>

<p>and the timetable will be announced next week</p>

<p>and I have today appointed a cabinet to serve - as I will - until a new leader is in place</p>

<p>so I want to say to the millions of people who voted for us in 2019 – many of them voting Conservative for the first time</p>

<p>thank you for that incredible mandate</p>

<p>the biggest Conservative majority since 1987</p>

<p>the biggest share of the vote since 1979</p>

<p>and the reason I have fought so hard for the last few days to continue to deliver that mandate in person</p>

<p>was not just because I wanted to do so</p>

<p>but because I felt it was my job, my duty, my obligation to you to continue to do what we promised in 2019</p>

<p>and of course I am immensely proud of the achievements of this government</p>

<p>from getting Brexit done and settling our relations with the continent after half a century</p>

<p>reclaiming the power for this country to make its own laws in parliament</p>

<p>getting us all through the pandemic</p>

<p>delivering the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe</p>

<p>the fastest exit from lockdown</p>

<p>and in the last few months leading the west in standing up to Putin’s aggression in Ukraine</p>

<p>and let me say now to the people of Ukraine that I know that we in the UK will continue to back your fight for freedom for as long as it takes</p>

<p>and at the same time in this country we have at the same time been pushing forward a vast programme of investment in infrastructure, skills and technology</p>

<p>the biggest for a century</p>

<p>because if I have one insight into human beings</p>

<p>it is that genius and talent and enthusiasm and imagination are evenly distributed throughout the population</p>

<p>but opportunity is not</p>

<p>and that is why we need to keep levelling up</p>

<p>keep unleashing the potential of every part of the United Kingdom</p>

<p>and if we can do that in this country, we will be the most prosperous in Europe</p>

<p>and in the last few days I have tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments</p>

<p>when we are delivering so much</p>

<p>and&nbsp;when we have such a vast mandate and when we are actually only a handful of points behind in the polls</p>

<p>even in mid term after quite a few months of pretty unrelenting sledging</p>

<p>and when the economic scene is so difficult domestically and internationally</p>

<p>and&nbsp;I regret not to have been successful in those arguments</p>

<p>and of course it is painful not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself</p>

<p>but as we’ve seen at Westminster, the herd is powerful and when the herd moves, it moves and</p>

<p>and my friends in politics no one is remotely indispensable</p>

<p>And our brilliant and Darwinian system will produce another leader equally committed to taking this country forward through tough times</p>

<p>not just helping families to get through it but changing and improving our systems, cutting burdens on businesses and families</p>

<p>and – yes – cutting taxes</p>

<p>because that is the way to generate the growth and the income we need to pay for great public services</p>

<p>and to that new leader I say, whoever he or she may be, I will give you as much support as I can</p>

<p>and to you the British people I know that there will be many who are relieved</p>

<p>but perhaps quite a few who will be disappointed</p>

<p>and I want you to know how sad I am to give up the best job in the world</p>

<p>but them’s the breaks</p>

<p>I want to thank Carrie and our children, to all the members of my family who have had to put up with so much for so long</p>

<p>I want to thank the peerless British civil service for all the help and support that you have given</p>

<p>our police, our emergency services and of course our NHS who at a critical moment helped to extend my own period in office</p>

<p>as well as our armed services and our agencies that are so admired around the world and</p>

<p>[Political content ommitted]</p>

<p>I want to thank the wonderful staff here at Number Ten and of course at chequers and our fantastic protforce detectives – the one group, by the way, who never leak</p>

<p>and above all I want to thank you the British public for the immense privilege you have given me</p>

<p>and I want you to know that from now until the new Prime Minister is in place, your interests will be served and the government of the country will be carried on</p>

<p>Being Prime Minister is an education in itself</p>

<p>I have travelled to every part of the United Kingdom and in addition to the beauty of our natural world</p>

<p>I have found so many people possessed of such boundless British originality and so willing to tackle old problems in new ways that I know that even if things can sometimes seem dark now, our future together is golden.</p>

<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
