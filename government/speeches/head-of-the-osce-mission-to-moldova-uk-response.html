<p>Thank you, Dr Neukirch, for your report to the Permanent Council.</p>

<p>Madame Chair, I would like to congratulate Dr Neukirch on his leadership which has enabled the Mission to continue to play its mediatory role effectively despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. We were pleased that the Mission team was able to complete its projects in 2020, and I welcome Dr Neukirch’s assessment that conditions are easing and that normal working practices are resuming, as is evidenced by our presence here today at the Hofburg.</p>

<p>Dr Neukirch, the United Kingdom regret that talks in the “5+2” format were not possible during the reporting period, but we are encouraged by your Report at the prospects of a full 5+2 meeting later this year.  That of course depends on their being substantive issues to discuss and the opportunity for real progress at such a meeting.</p>

<p>We commend your shuttle diplomacy during the reporting period, and your frequent contacts with the Parties and fellow mediators. It is clear that your activism and the trust which both Chief Negotiators have in you, has enabled you to greatly contribute to what progress there has been on the Berlin+ package and other Confidence Building Measures.</p>

<p>We welcome and share your view that these practical steps are vital precursors to a final settlement of the conflict.  I would welcome your assessment of the conditions which would be necessary for the resumption of discussion of the so-called “Third Basket”, which has been off the table for many years.</p>

<p>Dr Neukirch, we greatly appreciate your Mission’s monitoring and reporting of activity in the security zone, specifically recent reporting and action on human rights cases in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom shares your concern at the use of the so-called “Strategy for Combatting Extremism” by the de facto authorities as a means of silencing political opposition and freedom of speech.  We are also concerned at the conditions in which Oleg Horjan is being detained, as we approach the third anniversary of his detention in June. I am grateful to you for repeatedly raising these concerns with your Transnistrian interlocutors. Human rights abuses undermine the safety of citizens on both banks of Nistru and the negotiation process itself.</p>

<p>We welcome the lifting of the checkpoints which were established without due consideration through the Joint Control Commission in March 2020, and the lifting of restrictions on free movement starting with the Orthodox Easter holiday period.  We call for the de facto authorities in Transnistria not to re-impose any restrictions on free movement.</p>

<p>In the context of early parliamentary elections which will take place in Moldova on 11 July, I would like to acknowledge the particular importance you place on media freedom. I will take this opportunity to express our hope that media reporting during parliamentary elections will be accurate and balanced, and that polling will be free, fair and credible, and carried out in accordance with international rules and norms.</p>

<p>On gender; the UK believes that more gender balanced negotiations at Working Group level, but also within the Joint Control Commission and other relevant structures, could bring substantial benefits for citizens on both banks of the Nistru, and support the overall reintegration process. As such, we commend your intention to strengthen gender mainstreaming throughout the Mission’s programmes and encourage both parties to actively incorporate gender aspects into the deliberations of the working groups.</p>

<p>We note and welcome Chairperson-in-Office’s comments on the importance of gender in the 5+2 process.  We would be interested to hear what plans Dr Neukirch has to take that forward.  In particular, what expertise is available to the Mission in this area and how you cooperate with the OSCE Mediation Support Team, the OSCE Senior Adviser on Gender and the Chairpersonship-in-Office’s Special Representative on Gender.</p>

<p>In closing, the UK notes the continued lack of progress on removing ammunition from Cobasna. We deeply regret this state of affairs, and welcome Dr Neukirch’s confirmation that the Mission stands ready to assist. Let me repeat the United Kingdom’s call for Russian Forces stationed in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova without host nation consent to leave, in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolutions.</p>

<p>Finally, Dr Neukirch, I’d like to reiterate the UK’s strong support for your Mission and your continuing efforts to mediate between the two sides. The UK continues to support an outcome which respects Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and with a special status for Transnistria.</p>

<p>Thank you to you and your team.</p>
