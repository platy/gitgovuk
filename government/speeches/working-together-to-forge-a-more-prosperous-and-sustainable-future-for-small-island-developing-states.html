<p>Good afternoon, everyone.</p>

<p>Thank you very much to the panel for the very interesting interventions.</p>

<p>Today we strive to build a more secure and sustainable future for some of the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>

<p>There is no doubting the challenges we face.</p>

<p>Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine is damaging the global economy and compounding food insecurity.</p>

<p>The impacts of COVID-19 remain with us.</p>

<p>And the climate crisis continues to threaten lives and livelihoods.</p>

<p>Small Island Developing States have, of course, been disproportionately affected.</p>

<p>Yet you also have very powerful voices.</p>

<p>You have played a vital role in pushing for climate action. Thanks to the promises made in Glasgow, the 1.5 degree warming limit remains within reach.</p>

<p>You are also vital partners in the achievement of SDG 14, as you steward nearly a third of our global ocean.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is committed to supporting SIDS to become more resilient to climate and economic shocks.</p>

<p>We stand with you in your determination to achieve your development and economic goals.</p>

<p>Our new International Development Strategy sets out this vision.</p>

<p>We know that reforms are needed. It is crucial to place issues of vulnerability and resilience at the heart of planning and decisions about finance.</p>

<p>We launched a Call to Action on Access to Finance last year with Belize, Fiji and the Alliance of Small Island States, and we are now working to deliver its recommendations.</p>

<p>We are determined to address challenges around debt, eligibility criteria and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>This includes the potential use of Multi-dimensional Vulnerability Indices, and we are really looking forward to considering the conclusions of the High-Level Panel.</p>

<p>We urge financial institutions to consider how they can best factor vulnerability into their systems.</p>

<p>We know that too many SIDS face a cliff edge when they are no longer eligible for Official Development Assistance.</p>

<p>The Glasgow Climate Pact challenged us all to take this seriously.</p>

<p>The ODA criteria must reflect our discussions in Glasgow and take into account the unique challenges of vulnerable small states.</p>

<p>We must also improve the quality of finance and ensure that aid has the greatest possible impact.</p>

<p>This is why the UK, Canada, and the Alliance of Small Island States will launch a set of joint principles this year.</p>

<p>We will ask donors to tailor their approaches, and ensure they are backed by time, expertise and resources.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the UK will continue to support SIDS through our £40 million programme, launched at COP26, to support your development goals.</p>

<p>And through our £36 million Sustainable Blue Economies programme launched by our Prime Minister at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.</p>

<p>In these times of challenge, let us take the opportunity to turn ambition into action, supporting economies, protecting nature and boosting climate resilience.</p>

<p>Together we can forge a more prosperous and sustainable future.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
