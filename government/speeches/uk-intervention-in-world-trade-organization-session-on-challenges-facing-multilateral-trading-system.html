<p>The peaceful waters of Lake Geneva are far removed from the scenes of chaos and horror broadcast from Ukraine over the past months.</p>

<p>Yet, as we begin this, the World Trade Organization’s 12th Ministerial Conference, the war in Ukraine should be uppermost in our minds.</p>

<p>Russia’s invasion is a threat to our democracy and the rules-based order - the foundation of our free, fair and open trading system. Britain will always uphold the values of her people and her allies, she will protect Ukraine’s democratic right to exist.</p>

<p>Britain believes that free, fair and open trade can prevent yet more lives being destroyed through developing a more sustainable, efficient and resilient food supply chain for the future.</p>

<p>To get on and do this, I am glad that the British-led Joint Statement on Open and Predictable Trade in Agriculture and Food Products has been endorsed by over 50 WTO members.</p>

<p>We must work together to learn the lessons of the pandemic, back business to continue to innovate and agree a substantive trade and health package so we are prepared for the future.</p>

<p>More broadly, Britain believes that the WTO has a crucial role to support the free and fair trade that will support developed economies to renew and developing countries to grow.</p>

<p>Beyond this Ministerial, we must unite to find a path to reforming the WTO and ensuring a fairer, more stable trading system.</p>

<p>The rules-based system relies on everyone playing by the rules. The WTO needs to root out those who do not.</p>

<p>This goes beyond economics. Britain will put the pressing need to protect the environment at the heart of this work. We believe that green trade has a powerful role to play in countering climate change, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, whilst securing and generating economic growth.</p>

<p>Your Excellencies, we - together - face significant challenges but I am confident that the spirit to deal with them is strong.</p>

<p>It is through a multilateral rules-based system of free trade fit for the 21st century that we will address these obstacles and overcome them. This is why - together - we must redouble our efforts, put our divisions aside and harness the power of free, open and fair trade to tackle our modern-day challenges.</p>
