<p>Thank you, Mr Chair. I would like to welcome you Ambassador von Arx back to the Permanent Council and thank you and your team for your report and work over the last year.</p>

<p>The UK has a strong bilateral relationship with Uzbekistan. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-minister-for-south-asia-and-the-commonwealth-lord-ahmad-on-official-visit-to-uzbekistan">As our Minister for responsible for South Asia, Lord Ahmad, said during a recent visit to Uzbekistan to sign an MOU on economic cooperation</a>, the UK is committed to continuing its support to the Government of Uzbekistan, including in carrying out its reforms in economic development and public administration.</p>

<p>On the OSCE field mission’s work in Uzbekistan, I would like to single out three areas of work for special mention.</p>

<p>First, I am pleased that cyber security is a priority area in the first dimension and to read about the work that has been done to build the capacity of  national stakeholders on cybersecurity related issues, particularly allowing them to identify and investigate cyber espionage. Cyber espionage is an increasing threat to security and stability, including through the targeting of critical national infrastructure. It is right that the OSCE missions consider it a priority and support resilience to address this threat.</p>

<p>Second, I welcome the work of the mission on improving media freedom and I encourage the Government of Uzbekistan to ensure continuous progress in this area. An able and impartial media is an essential component of any healthy democracy, and their ability to report on the issues of the day without fear of persecution is essential. In Uzbekistan, we were pleased to be able to work with the Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting to help build the capacity of journalists to counter disinformation and provide objective reporting.</p>

<p>Third, I would like to celebrate the work done to support female entrepreneurs in Uzbekistan, working with the Business Women Association of Uzbekistan to improve female entrepreneurs’ knowledge in business management, fundamental marketing concepts, marketing strategies, and financial management. We, too, recognise the importance of women’s economic empowerment, which is why we are working with UNICEF to form a new, global alliance of twelve special partners from the business world, closing the gap where young women are enabled to develop the skills needed to transition from school to the world of work and secure good quality jobs.</p>

<p>Mr Chair - our discussions today take place against the dark shadow of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which impacts on the security of all participating States in the OSCE. We support the OSCE’s work through the Project Coordinator in Uzbekistan on comprehensive security and would ask Ambassador von Arx to pass on our thanks to all his team.</p>
