<p>Secretary-General, Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining this critical event.</p>

<p>As a direct result of the Taliban’s violent takeover, Afghanistan is the scene of the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>…More than twenty million people in dire need of humanitarian support….Over one million children at risk of dying from hunger.</p>

<p>Even while we respond urgently to the crisis in Ukraine, we can’t neglect the people of Afghanistan.</p>

<p>That is why the United Kingdom is proud to be co-hosting this conference with the United Nations, Qatar, and Germany, to strengthen the international response which has already saved lives this winter.</p>

<p>The UK has led by example.</p>

<p>Under our G7 Presidency, we rallied our allies in calling on the Taliban to respect the freedom and human rights of all Afghans.</p>

<p>We’ve doubled UK aid to Afghanistan, disbursing £286 million - $380 million - this financial year. And I am pleased to announce that we will match that with the same amount in the financial year which starts tomorrow.</p>

<p>As part of a global effort, we have provided health services for over 300,000 people.</p>

<p>We have provided over 6 million people with emergency health, food, water, shelter and education support through the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund.</p>

<p>I want to thank the UN agencies and NGOs for working hard to deliver in these tough times.</p>

<p>We worked closely with partners in the UN Security Council to agree the humanitarian exception to the UN Afghanistan sanctions regime.</p>

<p>But there is more we can, and must, do together.</p>

<p>Now is the time to dig deep by pledging to support the Afghan population, particularly those most in need.</p>

<p>The UN has launched its largest ever appeal, for Afghanistan this year.</p>

<p>We need to work through the UN to deliver real change for the Afghan people, upholding their rights and holding the Taliban to account.</p>

<p>Our friends and partners in the region continue to play a critical role.</p>

<p>I’d like to thank countries across the region that have offered support and delivered urgent humanitarian aid. I especially welcome the OIC’s new trust fund.</p>

<p>We know there are no easy fixes to Afghanistan’s problems.</p>

<p>Whilst humanitarian assistance is vital now, it won’t be enough to restart Afghanistan’s economy.</p>

<p>All Afghans have the right to basic services like education and health.</p>

<p>And we want to see Afghanistan able to grow so it can in time finance its own development.</p>

<p>But our potential to provide support will depend on how constructively the Taliban engage on key issues like the rights of women and girls and also ethnic and religious minorities.</p>

<p>Women and girls are amongst the most marginalised groups. They have been denied opportunities in education and employment – which are key drivers of equality.</p>

<p>No nation can succeed if half of its population is held back.</p>

<p>Women and girls must be allowed the chance to study at all levels. Children have the right, regardless of where they are born, to build their own future through education.</p>

<p>Most Afghan women suffer violence in their lifetime, and more girls are being pushed into early marriages.</p>

<p>That isn’t acceptable, and it is why we must put women and girls at the heart of our response.</p>

<p>Afghan women are fierce advocates for their country and deserve the opportunity to realise their potential.</p>

<p>The UK is committed that at least 50% of those we reach with our aid should be women and girls.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to monitor the Taliban’s actions, especially in this area.</p>

<p>We have to work in unison to deliver a better future for Afghanistan.</p>

<p>And by stepping up to the plate, we can enable freedom to flourish.</p>

<p>Our aim cannot be merely for the Afghan people to survive – we want them to thrive.</p>

<p>And that’s the key to building a better and safer future for us all.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
