<p>On 24 February, &nbsp;Member States met virtually to discuss a new instrument on pandemic preparedness and response. Stemming from a WHA decision entitled ‘The World, Together’, it was a day where we all recognised that we must work together to tackle health threats.</p>

<p>Yet that very day President Putin regime launched his illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, causing horrific health impacts.</p>

<p>Since then, as others have said here, there have been over 250&nbsp;attacks on health care, thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, and huge disruption to Ukraine’s health services. &nbsp;Countless&nbsp;hospitals lie in ruins.</p>

<p>The psychological toll on Ukraine’s people is unimaginable. Dr. Tedros spoke moving movingly on Sunday of his experience as a child of war. Russia’s aggression is turning millions of Ukrainian children into children of war.</p>

<p>As we look across the world, there are far too many conflicts and crises causing suffering. Each constitutes a tragedy. Each&nbsp;deserves our greatest attention.</p>

<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having a global impact that is exacerbating all these crises.</p>

<p>People across the world are facing food, energy, and commodity price rises. Yet&nbsp;Russia sees this and continues its relentless assault, weaponizing the global food supply and harming the world’s most vulnerable, causing lasting damage to health.</p>

<p>I understand the concerns of Member States who fear the politicisation of the Assembly. But war is a health issue. Health for peace. Peace for Health. The&nbsp;WHA must not be afraid to address health crises, including the causes and, in this case, the aggressor.</p>

<p>Let me urge Member States to support the draft resolution before us and stand up for the people of Ukraine, for their health,&nbsp;and for international law.</p>

<p>To those tempted to support Russia’s resolution, let me urge you to think again. Strip away the diplomatic language. See what is left. A call for the protection of civilians, while Russian forces are killing and maiming those same civilians as we sit here.</p>

<p>A vote for the Russian resolution is a vote to condone that suffering.</p>

<p>We urges our fellow Member States to stand up for Health and Peace. Peace for Health.</p>
