<p>Mr President, Excellences, the UK is proud to defend and promote freedom around the world.</p>

<p>We come here to the Human Rights Council to unite in this shared mission.</p>

<p>Together, we have the moral duty to stand up to aggression – especially when it comes from members of this very council.</p>

<p>We remain concerned about reports of violations from China, particularly Xinjiang and Tibet and other parts of the world like Afghanistan and Myanmar.</p>

<p>But today, we must face up to the urgent situation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>As we speak, Russia continues with its illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The consequences of Vladimir Putin’s unjustified aggression are horrific.</p>

<p>Russian troops are laying siege to once peaceful European cities.</p>

<p>Tanks are tearing through towns while missiles hit homes and hospitals.</p>

<p>Putin is responsible for civilian casualties and over 500,000 people fleeing – with the numbers still rising fast.</p>

<p>The blood is on Putin’s hands, not just of innocent Ukrainians but the men he has sent to die.</p>

<p>He is violating international law, including the UN Charter and multiple commitments to peace and security.</p>

<p>He is violating human rights on an industrial scale and the world won’t stand for it.</p>

<p>The UK stands united in condemning Russia’s reprehensible behaviour.</p>

<p>There are no shades of grey to this conflict. It is about right and wrong.</p>

<p>This is President Putin’s war against a sovereign nation. There can be no apologising or excusing it.</p>

<p>I urge nations to condemn Russia’s appalling actions, and to isolate it on the international stage.</p>

<p>Russia is now becoming a global pariah.</p>

<p>Just last week, we joined over 40 countries at the OSCE in condemning its aggression.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe also voted to suspend Russia.</p>

<p>And at the UN, we joined over 80 members in backing a resolution condemning Russian aggression.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russia stood alone in opposing it.</p>

<p>This is the cost of isolation and it’s a consequence of Putin’s war of choice.</p>

<p>We must continue to lead a chorus of condemnation to show Moscow that Putin’s ambitions will not succeed.</p>

<p>This is a struggle not just for Ukraine’s freedom and self-determination, but for all our freedom and security.</p>

<p>That is why the United Kingdom is proud to be at the forefront of support for Ukraine economically, politically and defensively.</p>

<p>We were the first European nation to send defensive weapons to the country, and we are leading the way in humanitarian support.</p>

<p>We have just pledged £220 million, including providing Ukraine with access to basic necessities and vital medical supplies, for aid.</p>

<p>We call on Russia to enable unhindered humanitarian access into Ukraine and safe passage for civilians.</p>

<p>Now is the time to come together with a strong response.</p>

<p>We have joined forces with the US, G7, EU and with other partners to take decisive steps through sanctions.</p>

<p>Together, we are cutting out the vast majority of Russia’s banking system from the global financial system.</p>

<p>We are using our collective heft, making up over half of the world’s economy, to cut off funding for Putin’s war machine.</p>

<p>We are delivering severe economic costs through these sanctions, as ordinary Russians are finding from queues at their local banks and rising interest rates.</p>

<p>These consequences will only increase in breadth and severity as the conflict goes on.</p>

<p>We are working to squeeze the Putin regime harder and harder by steadily tightening the vice.</p>

<p>We are going after the highest echelons of the Russian elite, targeting President Putin personally and all of those complicit in his aggression.</p>

<p>Nothing – and no one – is off the table.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot pretend that this is the first time Russia has subjected Ukraine to such aggression.</p>

<p>This Council has heard many independent reports about widespread violations by Russia since their illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p>

<p>The Office of the High Commissioner has documented arbitrary arrests, detentions, intimidation, and torture.</p>

<p>Ukrainian political prisoners remain detained in Russia and Crimea. Many are subject to torture and denied medical care.</p>

<p>Such abuses are far from limited to Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia continues to show contempt for the freedoms people deserve worldwide.</p>

<p>It continues to undermine Georgia’s territorial integrity in breach of UN Resolutions.</p>

<p>It remains responsible for widespread violations in Syria.</p>

<p>This goes hand in hand with what is happening to Russian people at home.</p>

<p>The Putin regime is dogged by allegations of arbitrary detention, police brutality and torture.</p>

<p>It continues to suppress freedom across the board, from free speech to the freedom of assembly.</p>

<p>Political opponents like Alexey Navalny continue to face gave threats.</p>

<p>There are reports of people from the LGBT+ community being arrested, tortured and killed in Chechnya.</p>

<p>And the Kremlin continues to clamp down on civil society, shutting two of its oldest NGOs – International Memorial and the Memorial Human Rights Centre.</p>

<p>The Putin regime has left Russia’s moral authority in tatters. It should be ashamed to sit in this chamber.</p>

<p>We know many Russian people feel the same way, which is why thousands of people have been arrested across the country at anti-war protests.</p>

<p>But no matter how hard the Putin regime tries, they cannot hide the truth.</p>

<p>At this critical moment, members of this council must make their voices heard.</p>

<p>Together, we can stand up to Russian aggression and back the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p>We cannot rest in this task until Putin is stopped.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, his regime will be held to account for its actions in Ukraine and across the world.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
