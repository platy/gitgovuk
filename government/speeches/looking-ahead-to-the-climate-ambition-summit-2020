<p>Deputy Secretary-General,</p>

<p>Excellencies,</p>

<p>It is a real honour to be speaking to you all again at the UN.</p>

<p>As the Deputy Secretary General has just set out, climate action cannot wait.</p>

<p>Even though COP26 has been postponed, we need to act now to fulfil our Paris Agreement commitments.</p>

<p>When I was last here in March, I heard many of you talk about the challenges your countries face and the steps you are taking.</p>

<p>Since then I have met with Ministers from many of your countries. On Zoom, at virtual events, and recently in person once again.</p>

<p>In fact, I am speaking to you today from South Korea.</p>

<p>Over this time, I have been listening carefully to both Parties and non-state actors.</p>

<p>I have been impressed by the commitment to climate action that I have heard.</p>

<p>It is clear that the appetite to tackle this challenge remains, but we all must do more.</p>

<p>Together, I know we can ensure the Paris Agreement delivers.</p>

<p>That is why I am here to tell you more about the Climate Ambition Summit 2020; co-hosted by the UK COP26 Presidency, the UN and France, in partnership with Chile and Italy.</p>

<h3 id="summit-details">Summit Details</h3>

<p>This Summit will be an important milestone on the road to COP26. It will be a chance for leaders to demonstrate their commitment to the Paris Agreement and to come together in support of the multilateral process.</p>

<p>This Summit will provide a platform for leaders ready to come forward with announcements under the three pillars of the Paris Agreement; mitigation, adaptation and support.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are calling for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New, more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs);</li>
  <li>Long-Term Strategies setting out a pathway to net zero emissions;</li>
  <li>Climate finance commitments to support the most vulnerable;</li>
  <li>And crucially, ambitious adaptation plans and underlying policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>We must all maintain our focus on increasing ambition, and there will be no space for general statements.</p>

<p>Announcements must show genuine progress from existing policies and Paris targets.</p>

<p>We will give priority to the most transformational commitments put forward.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether it is a major economy or smaller climate vulnerable country.</p>

<p>As COP President Designate, I am committed to a ‘whole of society’ approach, and we will also use the Summit to create an inclusive and diverse platform.</p>

<p>Featuring a range of vital non-government voices to hold us all accountable.</p>

<p>This will be a virtual summit, held on Saturday the 12th of December starting at 9AM New York time.</p>

<p>We will be seeking pre-recorded statements, and I ask Parties to provide initial expressions of interest in a speaking slot - along with an indication of their ambition - by the 6th of November.</p>

<p>We will issue a full logistical note shortly, including all details of the event and how to formally request a speaking slot.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>While I recognise that time is short and that the world is facing an immense challenge with COVID-19, we urgently need to raise our ambition.</p>

<p>The Paris goals require us to halve global emissions over the next decade, and to rapidly adapt to our warming climate.</p>

<p>Current NDCs put us on track for 3 degrees warming.</p>

<p>This is simply unacceptable, we must close the gap.</p>

<p>Yet, I remain optimistic; countries such as Jamaica, the Marshall Islands, Norway, Moldova, and our partners Chile have shown leadership by announcing new, more ambitious NDCs.</p>

<p>I am asking today, that you join them by coming forward with enhanced ambition in December.</p>

<p>I also welcome the recent announcements made by President Xi at UNGA and Prime Minister Suga yesterday, and we look  forward to working with both countries on their climate ambition.</p>

<p>It is clear that recovery from COVID-19 and climate ambition are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Member states can build back better by embedding their climate commitments into COVID-19 recovery packages, taking advantage of the plummeting cost of renewables, and the opportunities for our societies that green and resilient growth brings.</p>

<p>This will be a chance for us all to turn words into action, and we hope you will all join us for this important summit.</p>

<p>Only by coming together can we build the zero carbon, climate resilient future that is essential for our people and our planet.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
