<p>Good afternoon</p>

<p>this has been a big day and an emotional day for millions of families up and down the country</p>

<p>as children see – and play with – their friends for the first time in months.</p>

<p>And although I know that some will have been anxious</p>

<p>as pupils always are on the first day of term –</p>

<p>I also know that the overwhelming feeling is one of relief.</p>

<p>And we all know that the education of our children is so important that the greater risk now is keeping them out of school for a day longer.</p>

<p>I want to thank all the teachers who have got their schools ready</p>

<p>and who have been teaching throughout the whole period</p>

<p>– whether that’s remotely or in person -</p>

<p>your work has been astonishing.</p>

<p>And I want to thank the parents and all those who have been teaching at home</p>

<p>who have had to master Zoom</p>

<p>who’ve had to communicate every detail of the syllabus from fronted adverbials to quadratic equations.</p>

<p>And we all know that the burden has disproportionately fallen on women, often holding down jobs and providing childcare at the same time.</p>

<p>So our job now as government is to build on your efforts so that from now on our school children not only catch up on lost learning</p>

<p>but take the biggest possible step forwards with a concerted national programme for educational recovery.</p>

<p>It is thanks to all of you</p>

<p>parents, teachers, pupils –</p>

<p>thanks to this huge national effort to keep kids at home</p>

<p>that we have been able significantly to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>And so today we have been able to take that crucial first step on what we hope is our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom</p>

<p>Today allowing people to meet one-on-one outside for the first time in months,</p>

<p>allowing care home visits to take place with all appropriate precautions.</p>

<p>And this first step on the road map is made possible above all by our NHS which has now vaccinated more than one third of the entire UK population.</p>

<p>And we take this first step with confidence because all four of the most vulnerable groups have not only been vaccinated in overwhelming numbers</p>

<p>but it is now at least three weeks since they received their first dose and so they will be feeling the full benefits of the vaccine protection.</p>

<p>We will continue on this roadmap</p>

<p>but we must remember that today’s return to schools will of course have an impact on the spread of the virus</p>

<p>and so at all times and as we decide on the next steps when we take them we will be driven by the data,</p>

<p>and with the number of patients being admitted to hospital with Covid each day still around eight times higher than the lows of last Summer,</p>

<p>it is more vital than ever to follow the rules.</p>

<p>Hands, face, space,</p>

<p>and please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
