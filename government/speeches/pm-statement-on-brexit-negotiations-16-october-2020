<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>We left the EU on January 31 and delivered on the largest democratic mandate in the history of this country.</p>

<p>And since then we have been in a transition period obeying EU law, paying our fees – as a non-voting member – working on the future relationship we hope to enjoy with our friends and partners from January.</p>

<p>And from the outset we were totally clear that we wanted nothing more complicated than a Canada-style relationship, based on friendship and free trade.</p>

<p>To judge by the latest EU summit in Brussels that won’t work for our EU partners. They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is obviously unacceptable to an independent country.</p>

<p>And since we have only ten weeks until the end of the transition period on January 1, I have to make a judgment about the likely outcome and to get us all ready.</p>

<p>And given that they have refused to negotiate seriously for much of the last few months, and given that this summit appears explicitly to rule out a Canada-style deal, I have concluded that we should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia’s based on simple principles of global free trade.</p>

<p>And we can do it, because we always knew that there would be change on January 1 whatever type of relationship we had.</p>

<p>And so now is the time for our businesses to get ready, and for hauliers to get ready, and for travellers to get ready.</p>

<p>And of course we are willing to discuss the practicalities with our friends where a lot of progress has already been made, by the way, on such issues as social security, and aviation, nuclear cooperation and so on.</p>

<p>But for whatever reason it is clear from the summit that after 45 years of membership they are not willing – unless there is some fundamental change of approach – to offer this country the same terms as Canada.</p>

<p>And so with high hearts and complete confidence we will prepare to embrace the alternative.</p>

<p>And we will prosper mightily as an independent free trading nation, controlling our own borders, our fisheries, and setting our own laws.</p>

<p>And in the meantime the government will be focussing on tackling COVID and building back better so that 2021 is a year of recovery and renewal.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
