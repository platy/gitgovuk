<p>Good afternoon and welcome to this press conference on what has been a big day for many of us –</p>

<p>with the first chance to see friends and family outdoors, whether as six people or two households.</p>

<p>And I want to congratulate the members of Ilkeston cycling club in Derbyshire that set off at midnight,</p>

<p>the swimmers who broached the chilly waters of the Hillingdon Lido at the crack of dawn,</p>

<p>and more than anything I know how much it will have meant to millions of people to have joined someone else for a cup of tea in the garden.</p>

<p>And I must stress that it is only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step to freedom today.</p>

<p>And we must proceed with caution.</p>

<p>It is great to see that yesterday we recorded the lowest number of new infections for six months</p>

<p>deaths and hospital admissions across the UK are continuing to fall.</p>

<p>But that wave is still rising across the Channel</p>

<p>and it is inevitable as we advance on this roadmap</p>

<p>that there will be more infections, and unavoidably more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths.</p>

<p>So what we need to do is continue flat out to build the immunity of our population</p>

<p>build our defences against that wave when it comes.</p>

<p>And now that we have vaccinated more than 30 million adults across the United Kingdom</p>

<p>it is more vital than ever to protect the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>the evidence seems pretty clear that vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable has helped to drive down rates of hospitalisation and death</p>

<p>and now we want to reinforce that protection with a second dose</p>

<p>so for many people April will be the “Second Dose Month”</p>

<p>and please take up your appointment when it’s your turn.</p>

<p>And at the same time as we push forwards with our programme to offer a vaccination to all adults by the end of July</p>

<p>we’re building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities.</p>

<p>I’ve already told you that Novavax</p>

<p>– a potentially significant new weapon in our armoury against Covid -</p>

<p>is going to be made at Fujifilm in the North East.</p>

<p>And I can today announce that the Vaccine Task Force has reached an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline</p>

<p>to finish and bottle this precious fluid also in the North East</p>

<p>giving us between 50 and 60 million doses of UK made vaccine subject to the right approvals from the MHRA.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there is one other way we can all build our own individual defences against Covid</p>

<p>and enjoy ourselves at the same time –</p>

<p>and that is to take more exercise.</p>

<p>So I am personally thrilled that I will be able to play tennis for instance</p>

<p>And without being remotely preachy I do hope that we can take advantage of this moment</p>

<p>and the beautiful weather –</p>

<p>to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience in that way too.</p>

<p>And remember that outdoors is generally much safer than indoors</p>

<p>and the way to continue on our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom is to follow the rules</p>

<p>and remember hands, face, space and fresh air.</p>
