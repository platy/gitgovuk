<p>Thank you, Mr President, and I start by thanking our briefers Filippo Grandi and Martin Griffiths.</p>

<p>As a result of President Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a country of 44 million people is now on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

<p>Whatever my Russian colleague claims, the world can see Russia’s indiscriminate attacks against men, women and children across Ukraine, and its disregard for international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>Missiles have rained down on Kharkiv, with cluster munitions hitting residential areas and injuring residents. 
Disruption to supply chains has caused food shortages in Kramatorsk.</p>

<p>The reckless bombing of an oil depot in Vasylkiv, has unleashed toxic fumes in nearby communities.</p>

<p>Violence in Kyiv has forced people to seek refuge underground, with many thousands, including the elderly and disabled, unable to evacuate.</p>

<p>And as we’ve heard from the UN, today, hundreds of civilians have been killed as a result of the Russian invasion.</p>

<p>My Russian colleague may try to paint the UN’s reporting as hysteria.</p>

<p>Just as they said it was Western hysteria to warn of their impending invasion.</p>

<p>But let’s look at the facts: half a million people have already fled to Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia and other countries. 7 million people have been displaced and that figure, as the High Commissioner told us, is rising exponentially.</p>

<p>UN agencies and humanitarian partners have been forced to suspend operations.</p>

<p>In this moment, as the High Commissioner said, of urgent need, the situation that the agencies face is impossible.</p>

<p>The UK stands with the Ukrainian people during their time of need.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, announced $54 million in aid to help our Ukrainian friends.</p>

<p>This latest assistance package brings the total amount of UK Government aid pledged to Ukraine this year to $190 million.</p>

<p>Last week, Prime Minister Johnson also announced the UK would guarantee up to $500 million of loans to Ukraine through the Multilateral Development Banks.</p>

<p>The UK will also participate in tomorrow’s UN appeal.</p>

<p>UK Government experts have also deployed to the region to provide humanitarian support to those fleeing violence in Ukraine.</p>

<p>But colleagues,</p>

<p>We know that a humanitarian response is not enough to save the Ukrainian people from the disaster that Russia is inflicting on them.</p>

<p>So our message today is simple:</p>

<p>Once again, for the sake of humanity, we call on President Putin to stop this war and withdraw his forces from Ukraine.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
