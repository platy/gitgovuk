<p>Good afternoon everybody,</p>

<p>as of today, every eligible adult in England can use the national booking service</p>

<p>to Get Boosted Now.</p>

<p>If you’re over 18 and had your second jab at least three months ago, then you can get jabbed right now.</p>

<p>And it’s absolutely vital that you do.</p>

<p>Because the wave of Omicron continues to roll in across the whole of our United Kingdom,</p>

<p>with over 78,000 Covid cases today, the highest ever daily number reported,</p>

<p>and the doubling rate of Omicron in some regions is now down to less than two days.</p>

<p>And I’m afraid we are also seeing the inevitable increase in hospitalisations,</p>

<p>up by 10 per cent nationally week on week</p>

<p>and up by almost a third in London.</p>

<p>But we are also seeing signs of hope,</p>

<p>because since we launched our Emergency Omicron appeal on Sunday night</p>

<p>a great national fight back has begun</p>

<p>and people have responded with an amazing spirit of duty and obligation to others.</p>

<p>And I want to say that each and every one of you who rolls up your sleeve to get jabbed is helping this national effort.</p>

<p>And I want to thank everyone who has come forwards,</p>

<p>whether you’ve had to queue around the block at a walk-in centre,</p>

<p>or whether you’ve booked online.</p>

<p>And, of course, on behalf of the whole country,</p>

<p>I want to thank our NHS, our GPs our pharmacists, who with barely a day’s notice – 48 hours’ notice, have so accelerated the programme that we began this week</p>

<p>with the biggest Vaccination Monday ever in England</p>

<p>and yesterday the biggest booster day yet, with more than 650,000 boosters delivered across the whole UK.</p>

<p>And across the country, after all they have been through, those teams are going to keep going through Christmas and beyond.</p>

<p>Jab heroes like</p>

<p>Kim Kirk, leading the King’s Mill hospital vaccination hub in Mansfield,</p>

<p>who was asked a year ago to do it for four weeks and has been doing it ever since, with 180,000 jabs and counting.</p>

<p>Dr Laura Mount and the team at Central and West Warrington PCN, who have been organising pop-up vaccination clinics for the homeless.</p>

<p>Or the team at Home Park in Plymouth who have been regularly jabbing until 2am, because they just carry on for as long as there are people there wanting a booster.</p>

<p>And I want to thank those from every walk of life who are stepping forward to support them.</p>

<p>The military personnel deployed across every region of the country,</p>

<p>including an additional 100 in Scotland from yesterday -</p>

<p>as well as 2,500 firefighters.</p>

<p>And since Sunday night, we’ve seen more than 20,000 new volunteers signing up to help with the booster effort as stewards,</p>

<p>taking the total number to almost 33,000.</p>

<p>With every day we’re expanding the ranks of these healthcare auxiliaries,</p>

<p>an emerging Territorial Army of the NHS -</p>

<p>in a race against time to get those jabs in arms and save lives.</p>

<p>And if you’re watching this and you want to get involved,</p>

<p>just visit the website <a href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk</a></p>

<p>and do something this Christmas that you can tell your grandchildren about many Christmases from now.</p>

<p>In total, we’ve now boosted more than 45 per cent of all adults in England,</p>

<p>including more than 88 per cent of those aged 70 and over,</p>

<p>And while hospital admissions are going up,</p>

<p>nationwide we are starting to see admissions coming down among some of the more vulnerable older age groups where we have already got those boosters in arms.</p>

<p>From tomorrow, we’re speeding things up even further by removing the 15 minute post-vaccination waiting time.</p>

<p>And while we’re at it, from Monday, 12 to 15 year olds can book in for a second jab.</p>

<p>And we know how crucial it is to keep children in school,</p>

<p>so let’s all make sure our children and young people are vaccinated before they go back next term.</p>

<p>As we take forward our national mission, we are of course supporting similar efforts by the Devolved Administrations,</p>

<p>which are also rapidly increasing vaccination rates across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>A COBR meeting with Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast is taking place this evening.</p>

<p>But already the pace of rollout across the four nations is such that the UK as a whole now has twice as many boosters per head as the EU</p>

<p>and more than twice as many as the United States.</p>

<p>So let’s keep going.</p>

<p>Let’s carry on giving Omicron both barrels.</p>

<p>Let’s slow its spread and give the vaccines more time</p>

<p>Wear face masks indoors</p>

<p>Use ventilation</p>

<p>Get tested if you’re going to an event where you’re likely to meet lots of people</p>

<p>And get tested if you’re going to meet elderly and vulnerable relatives.</p>

<p>And we’re helping to get you the tests that you need</p>

<p>I want to thank the Royal Mail who are doubling home deliveries of testing kits to 900,000 a day from Saturday.</p>

<p>So let’s slow down Omicron’s spread</p>

<p>And at the same let’s reduce the harm Omicron can do to us by building up our vaccine defences.</p>

<p>We’re jabbing in hospitals, we’re jabbing in surgeries,</p>

<p>We’re jabbing in pharmacies and in pop-up centres,</p>

<p>We’re jabbing in shopping centres and on high streets</p>

<p>and in football stadiums - with mass events planned at Stamford Bridge and Wembley this weekend and daily “jabbathons” at Elland Road in Leeds.</p>

<p>We’re throwing everything at it.</p>

<p>Wherever you are, we’ll be there with a jab for you.</p>

<p>So please Get Boosted Now.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
