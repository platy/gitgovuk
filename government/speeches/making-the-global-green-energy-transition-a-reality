<p>Thank you, Minister Singh for that introduction.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi has often said that, “the world is one family”.</p>

<p>There is no clearer example of this than climate change.</p>

<p>No one nation or sector can tackle the problem alone.</p>

<p>The world will succeed or fail as one.</p>

<p>We all have a part to play: countries, companies, investors, cities, regions and individuals.</p>

<p>To avoid the worst effects of climate change, we must decarbonise the global economy five times faster in the next ten years than we have done over the past twenty.</p>

<p>We all know that the power sector accounts for a quarter of global emissions.</p>

<p>Decarbonising is absolutely vital. Not only to reduce emissions.</p>

<p>But to boost access to power, and to support clean growth and development.</p>

<p>And this is why, as COP26 President, energy is one of five key areas that I am urging all countries to focus on.</p>

<p>And there is no doubt for us that India is a key partner.</p>

<p>Because, here, you are a global leader.</p>

<p>With pioneering international initiatives like the International Solar Alliance.</p>

<p>One Sun One World One Grid.</p>

<p>The World Solar Bank.</p>

<p>And the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.</p>

<p>Which the UK is very pleased to support.</p>

<p>India is home to a renewable energy revolution.</p>

<p>The scale and pace of change is absolutely remarkable.</p>

<p>With solar capacity increasing around thirteen times in five years.</p>

<p>And with some of the lowest solar prices in the world.</p>

<p>You have already connected 700 million people to power since the year 2000.</p>

<p>And thanks to Prime Minister Modi’s commitment to generate 450 gigawatts of renewable power within a decade. There will be much much more to come.</p>

<p>It is our experience in the UK, that setting such targets provide investors with confidence and clarity.</p>

<p>In the UK our emissions reduction targets have helped us to grow our economy by 75% over the last 30 years whilst at the same time reducing our emissions by 43%.</p>

<p>And this has helped us to develop the world’s largest offshore wind sector.</p>

<p>We will accelerate that success with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, which we announced last week.</p>

<p>And this includes a commitment to quadruple our offshore wind capacity within a decade, supporting many thousands of jobs .</p>

<p>I know India has also enjoyed a surge of investment in renewables.</p>

<p>This is vital.</p>

<p>To make the global green energy transition a reality. We need investors to keep seizing the opportunities presented by the renewables revolution. In India and of course around the world.</p>

<p>And these opportunities are enormous.</p>

<p>A study by Imperial College London and the International Energy Agency found that investments in renewables have repeatedly outperformed those in fossil fuels:</p>

<p>Over the past ten years, the past five years, and in 2020.</p>

<p>Solar and wind are already cheaper than coal power in two thirds of countries.</p>

<p>Momentum is building globally behind net zero. With China, Japan and South Korea all recently setting targets.</p>

<p>Colleagues and friends will know And on 12th December, the UK will co-host a summit, with the UN and France, and our partners Italy and Chile, to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>This will be the moment for global leaders to show that we can make a step change on climate action.</p>

<p>By focussing our efforts internationally, we can drive down costs and increase uptake.</p>

<p>Every time the global deployment of solar power doubles, its price has fallen by around a third.</p>

<p>That is why the UK is committed to working in partnership to drive the renewables revolution.</p>

<p>We have established the COP26 Energy Transition Council. Bringing global leaders together.</p>

<p>We work with India on Mission Innovation. Accelerating clean energy innovation globally.</p>

<p>And we are partnering with the Government of India.</p>

<p>To help mobilise private capital into its green investments.</p>

<p>Our new UK-India Sustainable Finance Forum will increase the flow of sustainable finance.</p>

<p>And we are both anchor investors in the Green Growth Equity fund.</p>

<p>Catalysing private sector investments, through the City of London, to infrastructure projects in India.</p>

<p>Through international partnerships like these.</p>

<p>The insight of investors.</p>

<p>And the ambition countries like India have shown.</p>

<p>Together, we will continue to usher in the green global future of energy.</p>

<p>Protecting our planet for future generations.</p>
