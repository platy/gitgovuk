          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Good morning everyone</p>

<p>I’m delighted to join you at the Africa debate.</p>

<p>You would have seen the recent, interview with the Ugandan entrepreneur Ham Serunjogi. He’s the co-founder of Chipper Cash, an app that’s allowing people across Africa to make and receive payments and invest their savings.</p>

<p>Today Chipper Cash has millions of users, across numerous countries. Last year its revenues stood at $75 million.</p>

<p>However, when Ham first pitched his idea to a venture capital firm – he was quizzed about why he wasn’t instead seeking donations or development funding.</p>

<p>I think this anecdote illustrates how still, too often, the image of African countries in people’s minds is inaccurate, outdated and becoming more obsolete by the day.</p>

<p>Of course, this vast, diverse and dynamic Continent can never be defined in a few words:</p>

<p>Increasingly its story is one of modern cities – places like Lagos, Luanda and Kigali – where new tower blocks are springing up over the skyline and with young, energetic and educated citizens.</p>

<p>It’s a story of a booming fintech industry. Major firms like Nigeria’s Paystack, South Africa’s Yoco, not to mention Chipper Cash, are connecting millions of consumers and entrepreneurs to the global financial system.</p>

<p>This is also a story of a continent that is a green energy pioneer.</p>

<p>Countries are turning to renewables to power their future growth instead of polluting fossil fuels and setting ambitious climate targets.</p>

<p>Of course, for too many people, in too many places, this latest chapter in Africa’s story is yet to unfold.</p>

<p>Poverty, inequality, disparities in access to healthcare and education do still loom large. Bureaucracy and outdated systems can still stand in the way of economic growth.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it’s clear that the world needs to wake up to Africa’s new and compelling narrative.</p>

<p>That is why, the UK is responding to the Continent’s growth story with a bold trade strategy:</p>

<p>A strategy that is about building a sustainable, enduring and productive partnership.</p>

<p>A partnership in which we use trade’s power to make dependable friends to strengthen the rules-based order.</p>

<p>This partnership is about truly understanding Africa’s needs and exploring how our businesses can support them through projects that create jobs, support inclusion and sustainability and bring lasting value.</p>

<p>In turn this will build the Continent’s economic strength, so that countries can command a fair price for their vast resources and their people’s skills, that reflects their true worth.</p>

<p>Equally, our partnership is about opening up new opportunities for UK businesses to trade with one of the most dynamic parts of the world.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Africa is the future.</p>

<p>The IMF forecast that over the next five years, half of the world’s ten fastest growing economies will be on the Continent.</p>

<p>By the end of this decade Africa’s working age population will have grown by 30pc on 2020 levels. By contrast, Europe’s will have contracted.</p>

<p>By 2085 Africa is forecast to be home to a third of the world’s people.</p>

<p>So in short this is going to be an astonishing growth story and the opportunity is there for all to see.</p>

<p>If the UK is to future-proof its place as the most forward thinking and dynamic independent trading nation on earth, we must play our part.</p>

<p>So, what does that trading relationship and partnership look like in practice?<br>
First, it’s about investment. It’s about the UK helping to power African countries’ growth, both today and tomorrow, through its expertise and ideas.</p>

<p>As the Prime Minister has said, we aspire to be Africa’s investor of choice.</p>

<p>And, I’m pleased to say that according to UNCTAD, our investment in the Continent is valued at £49 billion, that’s more than any other nation.</p>

<p>This investment has continued to flow despite Covid19’s impact and the shockwaves caused by Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>UK Export Finance has also committed more to the Continent than anywhere else in the world, supporting projects from the Cairo monorail to hospitals across Cote d’Ivoire.</p>

<p>The possibilities for partnership are endless – too many for me to cover in this speech.</p>

<p>So if I may, I’ll focus today on one particular area, renewables:</p>

<p>In this, the year in which Egypt will be hosting COP27 – the question of how the Continent will power its astonishing growth and provide access to energy for all its people – has come under sharp focus.</p>

<p>Whether its wind power projects in Senegal, geothermal energy in Ethiopia, hydropower in Mozambique…as I mentioned earlier, increasing numbers of African countries believe that  renewables could be part of the solution.</p>

<p>And UK firms, with their expertise in everything from smart grids to solar energy, are already leading the way in supporting transition.</p>

<p>We’re not only the largest renewables investor in South Africa, we’re involved in projects, big and small, covering every aspect of green technology.</p>

<p>Indeed, renewables projects have formed the greater part of DIT’s investment support in Africa over the last year.</p>

<p>Wind turbines besides the Gulf of Suez are helping to power Egypt, as a result of a major investment from British investor, Actis.</p>

<p>In Mozambique, UK company Globeleq, has invested £20 million in solar energy and will soon develop a wind energy plant too.</p>

<p>While in Nigeria, Konexa, a British start-up, is pioneering a model of national grid optimization that could apply across the Continent. This will give people the confidence that when they click a switch, they’ll have the power they need.</p>

<p>In addition, there are scores of new, innovative companies with expertise in everything from hydrogen to energy efficiency, looking at Africa investment opportunities.</p>

<p>Hive Energy – based in Hampshire – is one example.</p>

<p>It’s part of a multi-billion investment in hydrogen and green ammonia production in South Africa. Technology by Sheffield based ITM Power is at the project’s core.</p>

<p>There are huge opportunity for us to achieve even more together.</p>

<p>To make this happen we need to bring together people, finance and ideas.</p>

<p>In January this year, our second Africa Investment Conference did exactly that. It focused on how the UK can further support the Continent’s transition towards cleaner growth.</p>

<p>We’ll be building  on this at the second UK-Africa Investment Summit next year.</p>

<p>More broadly, our DIT-led Africa Investors’ Group, made up of UK investors small and large, is helping to identify ways in which our firms can support growth across the Continent.</p>

<p>For my part, I hope to visit again soon in the near future, to see this productive investment partnership in action.</p>

<p>Last year I had the privilege of seeing some amazing solar panels projects of investment in Malawi and Egypt, so I’m looking forward to going back as soon as I can.</p>

<p>The second element of the UK-Africa trading partnership is the need to ensure the free trade of goods and services.</p>

<p>Back to those extraordinary demographics: African nations rising populations are going to result in surging demand.</p>

<p>In fact, according to our analysis, Africa’s import markets are forecast to undergo exponential growth – expanding more than five-fold from nearly $700 billion in 2019, to $3.9 trillion by 2050.</p>

<p>Again, this translates into extraordinary opportunities. We want to be able to position our businesses to seize those.</p>

<p>Clearly, to achieve this and to reduce costs for consumers and businesses in African countries, we need to remove trade barriers.</p>

<p>That’s why when the UK left the EU, we have signed no fewer than nine trade agreements with 18 African nations.</p>

<p>These deals also offer us an opportunity to build our understanding of countries’ ambitions and how we can respond to those needs.</p>

<p>However, Africa of course will truly come into its own economically when it trades more with itself. In 2019, trade between African nations, made up just 15% of trade on the Continent.</p>

<p>So, if the UK can be the partner helping Africa on this new course, we too, can grow with the Continent.</p>

<p>That is why we are enormous supporters of the African Continental Free Trade Area.</p>

<p>We see it as a game-changer and possibly the most exciting trade initiative globally.</p>

<p>The Free Trade Area will connect 1.3 billion people and economies with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion, through a single set of trading rules. This could boost intra African trade by over 50% and lift 100 million people out of poverty.</p>

<p>Last year, the UK became the first non-African country to sign an agreement with the Free Trade Area Secretariat…pledging to work with it on a range of areas including investment and trade facilitation.</p>

<p>In March I was delighted to invite Secretary General Wamkele Mene to the Department, to our department where we announced a UK programme to support negotiations and the Free Trade Area implementation. I’ll really like to take this opportunity to commend him for the way he is stewarding this incredibly important initiative.</p>

<p>Another key plan of the UK-African partnership is the fact that it exemplifies how trade as a force for good in the world.</p>

<p>Often when we talk about trade we understandably focus on the numbers, the exports, the imports, the investment. Yet we forget at our peril about the people behind those statistics – the jobs created, the businesses built, the lives changed.</p>

<p>But our human capital will always be our greatest asset.</p>

<p>So major UK firms investing in African countries, demonstrate that understand already.</p>

<p>The drinks manufacturer, Diageo, employs around 4,000 people across Africa.</p>

<p>It’s also having a powerful positive impact on communities through its policy of using local suppliers, and helping its employees to gain new skills, which in turn benefits local economies.</p>

<p>Across the Continent, there are countless other, smaller yet no less significant examples – demonstrating how the UK’s trading relationship with African countries is improving people’s lives.</p>

<p>Take the farmers in Zimbabwe’s Chimanimani Mountains who are rebuilding their communities after a devastating earthquake by selling their chilli crops to UK markets…</p>

<p>Or the hundreds of jobs generated by Bridgend-based manufacturer Nodor Group, in its factory outside Nairobi.</p>

<p>Those if you who are old enough will remember the TV show Bullseye and you might be interested to know, the factory makes dart boards for the biggest tournaments worldwide.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that increased UK-Africa trade also has the potential to be a real force for good for the UK. Access to new markets helps build strong businesses. Strong businesses generate prosperity for the whole country here to.</p>

<p>Equally, by establishing even closer trading links with African countries – we will open our economy to some of the most forward looking and entrepreneurial countries on earth.</p>

<p>This will build on the huge economic and cultural contribution of UK African communities to the UK.</p>

<p>So, the UK-Africa trade partnership offers us huge opportunities.</p>

<p>But there are still some countries on the outside looking in – effectively barred from all these benefits.</p>

<p>These nations might have natural resources and talent in abundance but their path to prosperity is blocked by poverty, conflict, exploitative models and vested interests.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re going to introduce two initiatives which we hope will help:</p>

<p>First, we’ve confirmed plans to launch our ambitious Developing Countries Trading Scheme.</p>

<p>It introduces more generous, less bureaucratic trading rules, that reduce tariffs, simplify rules of origin and the requirements to access better tariff rates.</p>

<p>For UK businesses, the scheme strips away red-tape and cuts costs, through over £700 million worth of tariff reductions – incentivising firms to import goods from developing countries.</p>

<p>Secondly, to mark Her Majesty’s 70 years as Head of the Commonwealth, in her Platinum Jubilee year, the Prime Minister announced a new initiative at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last month, called Platinum Partnerships, which will build closer trading ties between the UK and commonwealth countries.</p>

<p>While DCTS and Platinum Partnerships are focused on a country level – we also want to support individuals.</p>

<p>Those of you have heard before, my passion for female entrepreneurs, who I genuinely believe provides the economic backbone of many African countries, there creativity and development are sometimes constrained by factors like a lack of finance.</p>

<p>We know that equality opens the door to opportunity.</p>

<p>So, the UK is going to be joining forces ahead of the next UK-Africa Investment Summit with partner African organisations and institutions, to explore how we can find some solutions for this ongoing lack of finance for female entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>

<p>In October we will mark 75 years since the General Agreement on Tariffs (GAT) and Trade was signed in Geneva.</p>

<p>That agreement formed the foundation of the modern trading system that has done so much to increase prosperity around the world.</p>

<p>Today, I believe we are at another inflection point in the story of global trade – as the world’s axis of economic growth pivots towards the economies of tomorrow… like those in Africa.</p>

<p>So Before us there is a new opportunity – for the UK and Africa to build an extraordinary new trading partnership for the 21st century.</p>

<p>A partnership, in which we use trade’s power to build deeper, lasting and creative connections between our peoples and businesses.</p>

<p>If we take full advantage of this opportunity, I have every confidence that we will together, not only increase prosperity and create new growth. We will make a real difference to millions of people’s lives, today and for generations to come. Thank you.</p>
