<p>Thank you Mr Chair. Ambassador Villadsen, dear Henrik, we are grateful to you for briefing the Permanent Council and for your final report on the work of the Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine (<abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr>).</p>

<p>I want to begin by expressing my appreciation for the work and achievements of the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr> in the over two decades that it has operated in Ukraine. The UK acknowledges the historic role of the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr> in helping Ukraine meet its OSCE commitments. The <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr>’s strong relationship with its host has allowed it to contribute meaningfully to Ukraine’s resilience and development. This includes in the areas of rule of law, environment, assisting conflict-affected populations, reform, good governance and gender equality – to name but a few. These are all foundational elements of security, and the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr>’s wide-ranging approach to state resilience embodies OSCE principles.</p>

<p>The support of Ukraine and your team’s light-footedness have enabled you to maintain relevance despite dramatically changed circumstances. The <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr> was undaunted by the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued to deliver excellent value for money. Your last report included the period since 24 February which, as this Council is well aware, has witnessed large-scale and truly appalling events following Russia’s invasion. Once again, you and your team stepped up. Your work in the conflict space has been invaluable. To name just a couple of achievements from the most recent reporting period: the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr>’s work with local authorities and social services on psycho-social rehabilitation of veterans, and launch of mechanisms to help victims of human trafficking, are examples of how the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr> continues to make an impact on conflict-related issues.</p>

<p>It is therefore with deep regret that we recall Russia’s stated refusal to support the renewal of the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr>’s mandate on 30 June. Mr Chair, this is part of a troubling pattern. Russia blocked the Border Observation Mission; it blocked the Special Monitoring Mission and now it has announced its blocking of the mandate of the OSCE’s long-standing <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr>. This unilateral and destructive behaviour undermines the principles and institutions of the OSCE. It also underscores Russia’s isolation in the international community.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to pass on the UK’s immense gratitude to you, Henrik, your team and everyone who has previously worked for the Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine. We are grateful to the <abbr title="Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine">PCU</abbr> for its professionalism and hard work in these most challenging of circumstances. We wish you success in your future endeavours. Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
