<p>Good afternoon, it’s a pleasure to speak to you today.</p>

<p>Governments and businesses around the world are continuing to respond to the immediate and acute challenges posed by the covid pandemic.</p>

<p>But we know that the climate crisis has not taken any time off.</p>

<p>We must ensure that the global recovery delivers a greener, more inclusive and more resilient future for all our peoples.</p>

<p>One that delivers on the commitments of the Paris Agreement and meets the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>I would like to congratulate President Macron and Secretary-General Guterres for their leadership in holding this event.</p>

<p>The first ever global summit of public development banks.</p>

<p>Finance has a pivotal role in tackling climate change.</p>

<p>The IPCC estimate that limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees would require global energy investments of around $3.5 trillion a year until 2050.</p>

<p>And public finance has a crucial role to play in stimulating private investment.</p>

<p>Last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a plan to double UK climate finance to £11.6bn over the period 2021-2025.</p>

<p>And we call on others to match that ambition.</p>

<p>The OECD has estimated that climate finance from developed countries reached 79 billion dollars in 2018, up 10 percent from the year before.</p>

<p>And that bilateral and multilateral public finance has increased by 64 percent since 2013.</p>

<p>This shows progress, but there is much further to go.</p>

<p>Donors must meet and surpass the goal of mobilising $100 billion a year.</p>

<p>And our COP26 Presidency will focus on working with others to mobilise funds and improve access for adaptation and resilience.</p>

<p>Before COP26, we need to see all public development banks coming forward with clear plans.</p>

<p>Including target dates by which their operations will be fully aligned with the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>The Finance in Common Summit Declaration will point the way forward for our work.</p>

<p>Focusing on the green recovery and accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<p>And on 12 December, the UK, the UN and France will co-host a Climate Ambition Summit, in partnership with Chile and Italy.
And I invite leaders to use this as an opportunity to announce new commitments under the three pillars of the Paris Agreement; mitigation, adaptation and support.</p>

<p>Working together, we can deliver the greener, more inclusive, more resilient future that we all want to see.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
