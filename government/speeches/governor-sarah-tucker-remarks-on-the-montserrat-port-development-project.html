<p>Good morning, I would like to adopt the protocol already established.</p>

<p>First of all I would like to join others and say how very pleased I am to be part of this ground-breaking ceremony for the Montserrat Port Development Project.</p>

<p>If you forgive the analogy, we have had to navigate some challenging and at times choppy waters since this project was first launched in 2019. It has been a labour of love for all concerned to get to today.</p>

<p>I commend the Office of the Premier, the Ministry of Communication, Works, Labour &amp; Energy – and the Project Management Office - for their hard work and collaboration with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in achieving this key milestone for Montserrat.</p>

<p>The UK Government understands how pivotal the Little Bay Port Development Project is for Montserrat’s revitalisation, economic development, and sustainability. As Governor I was so pleased to receive confirmation that the UK was able to make a tangible demonstration of its continued support for our wonderful Island, by increasing the funding for this project from £14 million to over £28 million.</p>

<p>This investment in the port infrastructure will provide a safe, secure, modern and green facility for the island to improve access for all marine Traffic, be that, cargo vessels or cruise ships. It will boost Montserrat’s ability to connect to the region and the world.</p>

<p>This port will provide a vital pillar of infrastructure to underpin our economic growth, enabling development in tourism, trade and accessibility. Accessibility in its broadest sense, ensuring, as a modern faculty, Montserrat can meet the needs of all travellers, providing ramps and wide doorways continuing our development as an inclusive society.</p>

<p>We hope this new port will bring new job opportunities, and enable new investment, as part of the ongoing sustainable development of Montserrat.</p>

<p>I know the FCDO team would want me to thank the Government of Montserrat for its consultative and participatory approach, and its commitment to continue with strong community engagement throughout project design and implementation.</p>

<p>We welcome the focus on climate resilience in the project design which I know Meridian will develop further, so that the infrastructure can withstand climate shocks and is environmentally sound and sustainable.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to stand by Montserrat in supporting its resilient growth and key development priorities to improve the lives of its people. The FCDO and my office, look forward to our continued collaboration with partners in Government, as well as our colleagues at CDB, to ensure the smooth and efficient delivery of this transformative project.</p>
