<h3>A new age of optimism for Britain</h3>

<h4>Global Investment Summit</h4>

<p>Guildhall</p>

<p>18th October 2021</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/133399/cx_at_gis.jpg" alt="The Chancellor at the Global Investment Summit"></div></figure>
<p> </p>

<p>Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>

<p>I spent this afternoon in the House of Commons listening to the moving tributes to Sir David Amess.</p>

<p>Tonight, I know our thoughts are with his loved ones.</p>

<p>A unifying thread through the tributes to Sir David</p>

<p>…was his unbreakable sense of pride and optimism in this country.</p>

<p>And I think we honour him by embracing that same theme tonight.</p>

<p>So, let me begin by asking you to look up.</p>

<p>To look up at the magnificent ceiling of this ancient hall and imagine the skill and effort it took to carve every stone by hand.</p>

<p>Building work was completed the same year Gutenberg made the first printing press…</p>

<p>…at the beginning of that extraordinary flourishing of art, science, culture and commerce - the renaissance.</p>

<p>I believe that Britain is once again on the cusp of a new age of optimism.</p>

<p>Our goal is nothing less than for this country to be the most exciting and dynamic place in the world for you to do business.</p>

<p>This is a bold claim.</p>

<p>But I’m confident about this country’s future.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Well, I could talk about our world-leading industries – the creative sector, life sciences, or financial services, the engine that powers your businesses.</p>

<p>I could talk about our competitive corporate tax regime – yes, it’s going up, but still the lowest in the G7 and fourth lowest in the G20.</p>

<p>I could talk about our super deduction – the biggest tax cut for business investment this country has ever seen…</p>

<p>…making the UK right now the most generous, tax-advantaged place for you to invest.</p>

<p>I could talk about our agile regulation which leads the world in balancing the interests of consumers and businesses.</p>

<p>But I’m not going to talk about any of those things.</p>

<p>Not least because I know you’re waiting for your starter.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to give you three reasons to join me in being excited about the UK right now: our people, our ideas, and our transition to net zero.</p>

<p>Your businesses can’t thrive without talented people.</p>

<p>The UK has some of the best educated people in the world.</p>

<p>But one of the areas we’ve fallen behind is skills and education outside of university.</p>

<p>And we know that 80% of our 2030 workforce are already in work…</p>

<p>…so we’re doing more to support people throughout their lives to retrain and upskill in the sectors of the future.</p>

<p>We’re investing record amounts in adult skills and technical training.</p>

<p>We’re changing our student finance system to better support mid-career and lifelong learning.</p>

<p>We’re setting up new skills bootcamps, to help people retrain or upskill in high-growth areas…</p>

<p>…like AI, cybersecurity, and green energy.</p>

<p>And we’re massively investing in apprenticeships…</p>

<p>…giving employers greater incentives and a bigger role in how they’re delivered.</p>

<p>But we don’t have a monopoly on talent in this country.</p>

<p>So we’re making our visa system for international talent the most competitive in the world.</p>

<p>If you’re an overseas business who want to transfer staff here - we’re making it easier.</p>

<p>If you’re an entrepreneur who wants to start a business here - we’re making it simpler.</p>

<p>And, if you’re a talented student who wants to stay here - we’re making that easier too.</p>

<p>As well as brilliant people, Britain is also the home of brilliant ideas.</p>

<p>With less than 1% of the world’s population, we have 4 of the world’s top 20 universities;</p>

<p>15% of the world’s most impactful research;</p>

<p>The third highest number of publications worldwide;</p>

<p>The second most Nobel Laureates of any nation.</p>

<p>But having ideas isn’t enough.</p>

<p>We need to turn those ideas into companies, products and services that can change the world.</p>

<p>And that’s why I’m proud we’ve got more tech unicorns than any country, bar China and the US.</p>

<p>Proud of having more venture capital here than France and Germany combined - not that I’m in any way competitive.</p>

<p>So yes, this country is a science and technology superpower – but we need to do more.</p>

<p>We’re significantly increasing government R&amp;D spending, now the highest level in four decades.</p>

<p>To better support modern methods of innovation, we’re looking at broadening the scope of our R&amp;D Tax Credits;</p>

<p>To increase capital flowing to innovative businesses, we’re reforming our listing rules…</p>

<p>…and co-investing with VCs through our Future Funds;</p>

<p>And to turbocharge all of your supply chains, our new Help to Grow programme supports SMEs with mini-MBAs…</p>

<p>…and new software to boost their productivity and their innovation.</p>

<p>When you’re sitting in your Boardrooms, thinking about investment decisions…</p>

<p>…those critical first two questions about people and ideas are now matched by a third – Net Zero.</p>

<p>I know that for all of you, climate change is transforming how you think about your businesses.</p>

<p>Well, could there be a better place for you than the country that’s decarbonised quicker over the last twenty years than anyone else?</p>

<p>The first country in the world to legislate for Net Zero by 2050?</p>

<p>We’ve already established the UK Infrastructure Bank to partner with you on new green projects.</p>

<p>Just last month, we raised £10bn through the sale of the UK’s first Green Gilt – the largest inaugural issuance of any country to date.</p>

<p>And, after we became the first country to commit to mandatory climate-risk disclosures…</p>

<p>…today, we are publishing our Green Finance Roadmap – to make the UK the place for green investment.</p>

<p>So, people, ideas, Net Zero – three reasons for you to join me in being, confident, optimistic and above all, excited, about this country’s future.</p>

<p>As we begin this new age of optimism, there’s one central insight driving everything we do.</p>

<p>We know where ideas come from, where wealth is generated, where jobs are created.</p>

<p>Not by me. Not by Government.</p>

<p>By you. All of you.</p>

<p>Your businesses.</p>

<p>I want this country to be known around the world as a beacon for free enterprise.</p>

<p>A hotbed of brilliant international minds coming here to access our culture, our capital, our people, our markets.</p>

<p>A country where young people with brilliant ideas have the freedom and opportunity to found and grow the most exciting businesses in the world.</p>

<p>That is the kind of economy we are building;</p>

<p>That is what we are inviting you to be part of;</p>

<p>That is why I say…</p>

<p>…confidently and clearly and without reservation…</p>

<p>…Britain is open for business.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
