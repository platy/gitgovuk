      <div class="govspeak">
<p>Good evening everyone.</p>

<p>We are entering a new and crucial phase of our fight against Coronavirus.</p>

<p>Because the number of cases has gone up four times in four weeks</p>

<p>and it is once again spreading among the elderly and vulnerable.</p>

<p>There are already more Covid patients in UK hospitals today than there were on 23 March when the whole country went into lockdown</p>

<p>and deaths, alas, are also rising once again.</p>

<p>These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet.</p>

<p>And we must act now.</p>

<p>So we are giving local authorities across England around a billion pounds so they can protect vital services as they fight the virus.</p>

<p>Nightingale Hospitals across the North of England are being prepared for service.</p>

<p>And so we can squash this virus wherever it appears</p>

<p>we are today simplifying, standardising and in some places toughening local rules in England by introducing three levels of Covid Alert.</p>

<p>Medium, with existing national measures such as the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm.</p>

<p>High, with extra measures including a ban on indoor social mixing between households or support bubbles.</p>

<p>And Very High, for places where, without further action, the NHS will swiftly be under intolerable pressure.</p>

<p>Areas within the Very High Alert category will be reviewed every four weeks and nowhere will be shut down indefinitely.</p>

<p>And the exact restrictions at this level, Very High, will be worked out with local leaders, along with tailored packages of support.</p>

<p>But at a minimum they will, sadly, include a ban on all social mixing between households in private places, including gardens</p>

<p>and pubs and bars must close unless they can operate solely as a restaurant, serving alcohol only as part of a main meal.</p>

<p>We will also ask people not to travel into and out of Very High alert level areas.</p>

<p>Nobody affected by this will be left to fend for themselves.</p>

<p>And we will expand our unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions,</p>

<p>extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close,</p>

<p>and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks,</p>

<p>and extra funding too for those in the Very High category for local test and trace and enforcement.</p>

<p>You will shortly be able to type in your postcode into Gov.UK and see exactly what restrictions apply where you live.</p>

<p>The majority of the country will, for now, be at medium.</p>

<p>Most areas currently under local intervention will be at High,</p>

<p>and Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham itself, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move to this level.</p>

<p>Over the weekend we have been working with local leaders in areas where the data are most worrying.</p>

<p>And from Wednesday, local authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move to the Very High alert level.</p>

<p>In addition to pubs and bars we have agreed with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram that gyms, leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will close.</p>

<p>We are still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas.</p>

<p>But tackle it we will.</p>

<p>No one, least of all me, wants to impose these kinds of erosions of our personal liberty,</p>

<p>but I am as convinced as I have ever been that the British people have the resolve to beat this virus</p>

<p>and that, together, we will do just that.</p>

<p>With that I’ll hand over to the Chancellor, who has some more details on how we’ll be supporting these businesses, employees and areas affected by today’s changes.</p>
