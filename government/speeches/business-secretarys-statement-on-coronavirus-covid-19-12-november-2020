<p>Good afternoon. I am joined today by Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England</p>

<p>The average number of new cases each day is now 22,524, compared to 22,398 a week ago.</p>

<p>There are now 14,196 <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> patients in hospital across the UK, compared to 12,406 a week ago.</p>

<p>1,219 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, compared to 1,142 a week ago.</p>

<p>And, sadly, another 595 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported yesterday.</p>

<p>The 7 day average daily number of deaths each day in the UK within 28 days of positive test by date reported is now 375, up from 295 a week ago.</p>

<p>Our thoughts are very much with the families and loved ones of those who’ve lost their lives.</p>

<p>Which is a reminder to us, as to why we are taking the action we are, to stop the spread of this virus and ultimately save lives.</p>

<p>Today, we are also reminded about the vital importance of fighting this virus to protect our economy.</p>

<p>Whilst the economy grew by 15% in the third quarter, it slowed in September and remains 8.2% below where we were in February.</p>

<p>We in government understand acutely the human impact this statistic represents.</p>

<p>It’s jobs, livelihoods, and families affected.</p>

<p>So we will continue to support businesses now, and as they recover.</p>

<p>The government has provided unprecedented levels of support for businesses over the past 8 months.</p>

<p>To date, that represents over £200 billion in support.</p>

<p>This is one of the most generous and comprehensive packages of financial support provided in the world, which the International Monetary Fund has praised.</p>

<p>Just this month we have announced an extension of the self-employed grant scheme to March next year.</p>

<p>An extension of the furlough scheme, at 80% until the spring.</p>

<p>Cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses in England, which are required to be closed due to this month’s national restrictions.</p>

<p>These will benefit 600,000 business premises.</p>

<p>And I can confirm today that we will be distributing £2.2 billion to local authorities tomorrow, to allow them to make these vital grant payments to businesses which have been affected.</p>

<p>All of these measures are designed to preserve jobs and help businesses stay afloat.</p>

<p>Today, we have also announced that more than 19,000 jobs have been created so far through our Kickstart Scheme.</p>

<p>These jobs are spread across the country and in a variety of sectors.</p>

<p>I know how hard this job market is, particularly for young job seekers, hoping to enter the workplace for the first time.</p>

<p>The Kickstart Scheme is a ray of hope for young people, and I want to thank all the businesses which have stepped up to participate in this scheme.</p>

<p>I speak to businesses everyday, and I can see, that despite the tough times, they are determined to soldier through this.</p>

<p>Through sheer hard work, innovation, resilience and invoking a real community spirit across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>For example, in Aberdeenshire, Brewdog has made hand sanitiser to protect our front-line NHS staff.</p>

<p>In Belfast, Axial3D has helped to develop thousands of new ventilators.</p>

<p>In Surrey, Carousel Lights have adapted their manufacturing process to produce ‘sneeze screens’ for GP surgeries, pharmacies, and care homes.</p>

<p>In Caerphilly, Transcend Packaging has converted production lines to create <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, almost doubling their workforce in just four months.</p>

<p>Because, despite the government’s support, and when it comes down to it, it is you who are keeping this country going.</p>

<p>You who are powering our economic recovery.</p>

<p>Just as our brilliant scientists and researchers are powering ahead in the race to discover a safe and effective vaccine.</p>

<p>A little over 6 months ago, I stood here and announced the creation of the Vaccines Taskforce.</p>

<p>A team of industry experts, scientists and civil servants, with one mission: to secure a vaccine to beat down this virus.</p>

<p>Since then, they have secured access to 350 million doses, through agreements on 6 of the leading candidates in the world.</p>

<p>The Taskforce has demonstrated how we can work together at pace.</p>

<p>Business and science, the NHS and local communities, together forging a path out of this predicament.</p>

<p>But, although this week’s announcement on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is potentially very good news, we still have a lot of hurdles to overcome before we can be certain of its safety and efficacy.</p>

<p>And so we must ensure that we continue to follow the guidance.</p>

<p>To protect our loved ones, our families, our friends, our communities.</p>

<p>Because the virus is still here. It is still a danger.</p>

<p>So we must not lose our resolve now.</p>

<p>We must keep focused.</p>

<p>To protect the health of the nation and the health of the economy.</p>

<p>Working together, supporting each other, we will get through this.</p>

<p>We will come out the other side stronger, more resilient and more united.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
