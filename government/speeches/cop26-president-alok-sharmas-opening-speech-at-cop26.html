<p>Friends, it is an honour to speak to you today for the first time as COP President.</p>

<p>And I want to thank my dear friend Carolina for her really strong leadership over the past two years.</p>

<p>Friends, I am very aware of the responsibility placed upon me in this role.</p>

<p>And I do not underestimate the challenge.</p>

<p>Let me start first by formally welcoming you to Glasgow.</p>

<p>And I want to thank you for all your efforts in getting to the United Kingdom, which I know for some has been arduous due to the impacts of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Indeed for almost two years now the pandemic has caused devastation and disruption, to lives and livelihoods across the world.</p>

<p>And I know this has particularly affected the least developed countries and the small island developing states.</p>

<p>And because of the pandemic, as you know, we postponed COP26 by a year. But during that year, climate change did not take time off.</p>

<p>And the IPCC report in August was a wake-up call for all of us.</p>

<p>It made clear that the lights are flashing red on the climate dashboard.</p>

<p>That report, agreed by 195 Governments, makes clear that human activity is unequivocally the cause of global warming.</p>

<p>And we know that the window to keep 1.5 degrees within reach is closing.</p>

<p>I have been humbled to speak over this year with communities devastated by climate change.</p>

<p>On a visit to Jomsom in Nepal, in the Hindu-Kush region I spoke to communities literally displaced from their homes from a combination of droughts and floods.</p>

<p>In Barbuda I met communities still suffering from the ravages of Hurricane Irma four years ago.</p>

<p>I have spoken with communities in East Africa fighting plagues of locusts spawned by climate change.</p>

<p>And earlier this month I spoke to a group of women in Madagascar,</p>

<p>Determinedly coping with what some describe, as the first climate induced famine in the world.</p>

<p>Friends, in each of our countries we are seeing the devastating impact of a changing climate.</p>

<p>Floods, cyclones, wildfires, record temperatures.</p>

<p>We know that our shared planet is changing for the worse.</p>

<p>And we can only address that together, through this international system.</p>

<p>And we know what we need to do.</p>

<p>Because six years ago, in Paris we agreed our shared goals.</p>

<p>We said we would protect people and nature from the effects of climate change.</p>

<p>We said we would get finance flowing to climate action.</p>

<p>And we said we would limit the rise in global temperature to well below two degrees pursuing efforts towards 1.5.</p>

<p>The rapidly changing climate is sounding an alarm to the world, to step up on adaptation, to address loss and damage, and to act now to keep 1.5 alive.</p>

<p>We know that this COP, COP26, is our last best hope to keep 1.5 in reach.</p>

<p>And I know that we have an unprecedented negotiations agenda ahead of us.</p>

<p>But I believe this international system can deliver.</p>

<p>It must deliver.</p>

<p>And as COP President I am committed to promoting transparency and inclusivity.</p>

<p>And I will lead this conference in accordance with the draft rules of procedure, and with the utmost respect for the party-driven nature of our process.</p>

<p>In that spirit I believe that we can resolve the outstanding issues. We can move the negotiations forward. And we can launch a decade of every increasing ambition and action.</p>

<p>And, together, we can seize the enormous opportunities for green growth, for good green jobs, for cheaper, cleaner power.</p>

<p>But we need to hit the ground running to develop the solutions that we need.</p>

<p>And that work, my friends, starts today.</p>

<p>And we will succeed.</p>

<p>Or fail.</p>

<p>As one.</p>

<p>Astronauts speak of the intense emotion they feel when looking back at Earth from space. Seeing it gleaming through the darkness of the cosmos.</p>

<p>Incredible, improbable and infinitely precious.</p>

<p>And if we act now, and we act together, we can protect our precious planet.</p>

<p>So letâ€™s come together over these two weeks.</p>

<p>And ensure that where Paris promised, Glasgow delivers.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
