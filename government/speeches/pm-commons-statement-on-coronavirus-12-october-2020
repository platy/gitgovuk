<p>Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our continuing fight against coronavirus</p>

<p>and how we intend to fulfil our simultaneous objectives</p>

<p>saving lives, protecting the NHS</p>

<p>while keeping our children in school and our economy running,</p>

<p>and protecting jobs and livelihoods</p>

<p>This morning the Deputy Chief Medical Officer set out the stark reality of the second wave of this virus</p>

<p>the number of cases has quadrupled in the last three weeks</p>

<p>there are now more people in hospital with Covid</p>

<p>than when we went into lockdown on March 23</p>

<p>and deaths are already rising</p>

<p>and of course there are those who say that on that logic we should go back into a full national lockdown</p>

<p>of indefinite duration</p>

<p>closing schools and businesses</p>

<p>telling people again to stay at home as we did in March</p>

<p>once again shuttering our lives and our society</p>

<p>I do not believe that would be the right course,</p>

<p>We would not only be depriving our children of their education</p>

<p>we would do such damage to our economy as to erode our long term ability to fund the NHS and other crucial public services</p>

<p>And on the other side of the argument there are those who think that the patience of the public is now exhausted</p>

<p>and that we should abandon the fight against Covid</p>

<p>stand aside, let nature take her course, and call a halt to these repressions of liberty</p>

<p>and of course I understand those emotions</p>

<p>I understand the frustration of those who have been chafing under the restrictions, the sacrifices they have made</p>

<p>But if we were to follow that course Mr Speaker, and let the virus rip,</p>

<p>then the bleak mathematics dictate that we would suffer not only an intolerable death toll from Covid,</p>

<p>We would put such huge strain on our NHS, with an uncontrolled second spike</p>

<p>that our doctors and nurses would be simply unable to devote themselves to the other treatments</p>

<p>for cancer, for heart disease and hundreds more</p>

<p>that have already been delayed and that would be delayed again</p>

<p>with serious long term damage to the health of the nation</p>

<p>and I am afraid it is no answer to say that we could let the virus take hold among the young and fit</p>

<p>while shielding the elderly and vulnerable</p>

<p>because the virus would then spread with such velocity in the general population that there would be no way of stopping it from spreading among the elderly</p>

<p>and even if the virus is less lethal for the under 60s</p>

<p>there will still be many younger people for whom, alas, it remains lethal</p>

<p>So Mr Speaker, we don’t want to go back to another national lockdown</p>

<p>We can’t let the virus rip</p>

<p>and so we have followed since June a balanced approach with the support of many Members across the House</p>

<p>to keeping the R down</p>

<p>while keeping schools and the economy going</p>

<p>and controlling the virus by changing our behaviour so as to restrict its spread</p>

<p>That is why we have the Rule of Six,</p>

<p>and why we have restrictions such as a 10pm closing time on our hospitality sector.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, I take no pleasure whatsoever in imposing restrictions on these businesses, many of which have gone to great lengths to reopen as safely as possible.</p>

<p>Nor do I want to stop people enjoying themselves,</p>

<p>but we must act to save lives.</p>

<p>And the evidence shows that</p>

<p>in changing our behaviour</p>

<p>in restricting transmission between us our actions are saving lives.</p>

<p>Left unchecked each person with the virus will infect on average between 2.7 and 3 others</p>

<p>but SAGE assess that the current R nationally is between 1.2 and 1.5.</p>

<p>So we are already suppressing that R to well below its natural level</p>

<p>which is why the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in March.</p>

<p>But we need to go further.</p>

<p>In recent months, we have worked with local leaders to counter local spikes with targeted restrictions.</p>

<p>But this local approach has inevitably produced different sets of rules in different parts of the country</p>

<p>that are now complex to understand and enforce.</p>

<p>So just as we simplified our national rules with the Rule of Six,</p>

<p>we will now simplify and standardise our local rules</p>

<p>by introducing a three tiered system of local Covid Alert Levels in England - set at medium, high, and very high.</p>

<p>The “medium” alert level, which will cover most of the country, and will consist of the current national measures.</p>

<p>This includes the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm.</p>

<p>The “high” alert level reflects the interventions in many local areas at the moment.</p>

<p>This primarily aims to reduce household to household transmission, by preventing all mixing between different households or support bubbles indoors.</p>

<p>In these areas, the Rule of Six will continue to apply outdoors, where it is harder for the virus to spread, in public spaces as well as private gardens.</p>

<p>Most areas which are already subject to local restrictions will automatically move into the “high” alert level.</p>

<p>As a result of rising infection rates, Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move into the “high” alert level.</p>

<p>The “very high” alert level will apply where transmission rates are rising most rapidly and where the NHS could soon be under unbearable pressure without further restrictions.</p>

<p>In these areas the government will set a baseline of prohibiting social mixing indoors and in private gardens</p>

<p>and, I’m sorry to say, closing pubs and bars,</p>

<p>We want to create the maximum possible local consensus behind this more severe local action,</p>

<p>so in each area, we will work with local government leaders on the additional measures which should be taken.</p>

<p>This could lead to further restrictions on the hospitality, leisure, entertainment or personal care sectors.</p>

<p>But retail, schools and universities will remain open.</p>

<p>As my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor has set out, the government will expand its unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions,</p>

<p>extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close,</p>

<p>and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks.</p>

<p>We will also provide Local Authorities across England with around £1 billion of new financial support, on top of our £3.6 billion Towns Fund.</p>

<p>And for very high areas, we will give further financial support for local test and trace, and local enforcement</p>

<p>and assistance from the armed forces – not for enforcement but rather to support local services, if desired in the local area.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, I can report that we have been able to reach agreement with leaders in Merseyside.</p>

<p>Local Authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move into the “very high” alert level from Wednesday.</p>

<p>In addition to the baseline I have outlined, that is as well as pubs and bars, in Merseyside gyms and leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will also close.</p>

<p>I would like to put on record my thanks to Steve Rotheram and his colleagues for their cooperation in very difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Engagement with other leaders in the North West, the North East and Yorkshire & Humber is continuing.</p>

<p>I know how difficult this is – they like, like everyone in the House, us are grappling with very real dilemmas - but we cannot let the NHS fall over when lives are at stake.</p>

<p>So let me repeat the offer that we are making to those local authorities – work with us on these difficult but necessary measures in the areas that are rated very high areas, in return for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more support for local test and trace</li>
  <li>more funding for local enforcement</li>
  <li>the offer of help from the armed services</li>
  <li>the job support scheme as announced by the Chancellor</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe not to act would be unforgivable, so I hope that rapid progress can be made in the coming days.</p>

<p>Regulations for all three Covid local alert levels are being laid today. They will be debated and voted on tomorrow, before coming into force on Wednesday.</p>

<p>We will also keep these measures under constant review, including a four-week sunset clause for interventions in “very high” areas.</p>

<p>A postcode search on gov.uk, as well as the NHS Covid-19 app, will show which local alert level applies in each area</p>

<p>and we are also publishing updated guidance to explain what the Covid alert levels mean for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.</p>

<p>And while these levels specifically apply to England, we continue work closely with the Devolved Administrations to tackle this virus across the whole of United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker</p>

<p>This is not how we want to live our lives,</p>

<p>but this is the narrow path we have to tread</p>

<p>between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown</p>

<p>and the massive human and indeed economic cost of an uncontained epidemic</p>

<p>With local and regional and national government coming together</p>

<p>in a shared responsibility</p>

<p>and a shared effort</p>

<p>to deliver ever better testing and tracing, ever more efficient enforcement of the rules</p>

<p>and with ever improving therapies, with the mountains of PPE and the ventilators that we have stockpiled</p>

<p>With all the lessons we have learned in the last few months we are becoming better and better at fighting this virus</p>

<p>and though I must warn the House again that the weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult</p>

<p>and will test the mettle of this country</p>

<p>I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed</p>

<p>And I commend this statement to the House</p>
