<p>It is a pleasure to join you today.</p>

<p>And to participate in the opening of Mock COP.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard to deliver this event.</p>

<p>And I applaud your dedication and commitment to tackling climate change.</p>

<p>Across the world, young people are leading the charge on climate action.</p>

<p>We see this, in projects like the Resilient40.</p>

<p>Which is amplifying the voices of over 60 youth leaders, from 29 African countries in vital climate change discussions.</p>

<p>Or indeed the Resolution Project, which supports student entrepreneurs with over 300 social ventures in more than 80 countries.</p>

<p>From recycling solutions in Ethiopia.</p>

<p>To water management in Brazil.</p>

<p>And household biogas generation in Nepal.</p>

<p>Young people are on the frontline of global climate action.</p>

<p>And this is absolutely vital.</p>

<p>For the future of our planet.</p>

<p>And for the success of COP26 next November.</p>

<p>The gravity and urgency of the situation we face demands that COP26 marks the moment</p>

<p>when the world unites together behind a fair, resilient and zero emissions future.</p>

<p>And that means governments committing to ambitious emission reduction targets, and adaptation plans.</p>

<p>It means donor countries living up to their obligations.</p>

<p>And fulfilling the commitments that they have made to the global South to put $100 billion a year into international climate finance.</p>

<p>And it means listening to diverse voices in the negotiations.</p>

<p>So that we are ensuring the interests of young people, as well as Civil Society as a whole, are heard loud and clear.</p>

<p>From both the global South and North.</p>

<p>To achieve this, I have been clear that we want civil society groups to be at the heart of both our preparations for COP, and the summit itself.</p>

<p>That is why I met with young people and civil society organisations on a visit to the UN in New York earlier in the year.</p>

<p>And I commit to meeting groups which comprise young people and civil society in every country that I visit going forward.</p>

<p>It is also why we have established the COP26 Civil Society and Youth advisory council.</p>

<p>Where young activists, NGOs, indigenous peoples and faith groups are very much part of our conversations in planning COP26.</p>

<p>We are also supporting our COP partners, Italy.</p>

<p>Both in their preparations for the Pre-COP and of course the Youth Event next September.</p>

<p>And in the launch of their Youth4Climate series.</p>

<p>Helping to support and amplify the work of young climate activists.</p>

<p>Because such activism plays a really vital role.</p>

<p>Although the commitments required in the Paris Agreement need to be made by national governments, success will belong to each and every one of us.</p>

<p>Reaching net zero will only be achieved through a joint effort.</p>

<p>And for this civil society is absolutely vital.</p>

<p>You are vital in pushing all of us to go further: governments and regions; businesses and cities; schools and universities.</p>

<p>By raising awareness, generating support, and asking us to do more.</p>

<p>That is one of the great benefits of this Mock COP.</p>

<p>It will show governments and organisations around the world the appetite that exists for ambitious climate action from young people.</p>

<p>So I will finish with this ask: keep up that momentum.</p>

<p>Keep showing us what is possible.</p>

<p>And keep advocating for climate action in your home countries.</p>

<p>Because if you do, the job of negotiators, who are urging countries around the world to make more ambitious commitments, becomes much easier.</p>

<p>As does the work of the Race to Zero campaign.</p>

<p>Which is encouraging non-state actors, such as businesses, cities, regions and universities around the world to commit to net zero as soon as possible.</p>

<p>And if we work together in this way, I believe COP26 will mark the moment when the potential of the Paris Agreement is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
