          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Good morning – welcome to London tech week.</p>

<p>Your success is personal to me.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of living, studying, and working in California.</p>

<p>That experience left a lasting mark on me.</p>

<p>I lived and breathed the culture that was adventurous, optimistic, and forward-thinking.</p>

<p>Willing to take risks.</p>

<p>To be imaginative.</p>

<p>To build new products, services, businesses that could change the world.</p>

<p>And I see that culture here at home, too.</p>

<p>I’ve been travelling a lot in the last few months, right across the UK.</p>

<p>And wherever I go, I meet young people who are hungry, ambitious, unencumbered by timidity and orthodoxy.</p>

<p>And looking at all of you, I know that we’ll see that same spirit here at Tech Week, too.</p>

<p>So I’m optimistic.</p>

<p>And the statistics show there is good cause to be optimistic.</p>

<p>The UK has created more tech unicorns than any other country, bar the US and China.</p>

<p>We have extraordinary, distinctive strengths in FinTech, life sciences, and creative industries.</p>

<p>Our corporate and capital gains tax rates are internationally competitive.</p>

<p>And we’re known around the world for our agile approach to regulation…</p>

<p>…which acts, where needed, to address concerns about large, dominant players…</p>

<p>…while backing innovation.</p>

<p>You can see that in our approach to financial regulation, where we’ve pioneered:</p>

<p>The regulatory sandbox, Open Banking, and now, an innovative framework for crypto and blockchain.</p>

<p>So we already have an incredible, thriving tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>But we know we need to do more.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest question we face right now is where our future growth is going to come from.</p>

<p>The answer is innovation.</p>

<p>Just look at our history.</p>

<p>Over the last 50 years, innovation broadly defined created around half of the UK’s productivity growth.</p>

<p>But since the financial crisis, like many countries around the world, our rate of innovation does seem to have slowed.</p>

<p>But I am confident that we can turn that round.</p>

<p>With the rise of general-purpose technologies like AI, it is plausible to believe we are on the cusp of a new wave of innovation.</p>

<p>But we need to make sure we are ready to capitalise.</p>

<p>To do that, there are three tools at our disposal – capital, people, and ideas. And we are deploying them all.</p>

<p>First, capital.</p>

<p>The UK is already a natural home for growing businesses to raise finance.</p>

<p>In 2021, even in the midst of covid, VC investment in the UK didn’t just grow – it more than doubled.</p>

<p>London is fourth for VC investment globally, behind only Beijing, San Francisco, and New York.</p>

<p>Our tax reliefs for investing in start-ups are internationally best in class.</p>

<p>And it’s not just private markets, but public too.</p>

<p>In 2021, over 120 companies chose to list in London; confirming that London is the dominant European IPO market.</p>

<p>And we want to go further.</p>

<p>We’re reforming our Listing Rules to make it even easier for companies to raise public funding.</p>

<p>We’re overhauling Solvency II and the charge cap regime to unlock pensions and insurance industry capital.</p>

<p>And through the Future Funds and British Business Bank…</p>

<p>…we’re providing direct government backing to some of the most exciting, fastest-growing scale-up businesses.</p>

<p>So if you’re an entrepreneur looking for funding – I want you to look at the UK and say: that’s where I want to be.</p>

<p>Now our second priority is to equip our people with the skills they need to thrive.</p>

<p>We have some of the best educated people in the world.</p>

<p>And the percentage of tertiary-level graduates studying STEM courses here in the UK, is higher than even the US.</p>

<p>But we don’t have a monopoly on talent.</p>

<p>Nearly half of our STEM researchers are immigrants…</p>

<p>…and around half of our most innovative fastest companies have an immigrant founder.</p>

<p>So we’re making our visa system for international talent the most competitive in the world.</p>

<p>Let me give you just one example.</p>

<p>We’ve just announced a new High Potential Individual visa.</p>

<p>If you’re a young person…</p>

<p>Who’s graduated from a global top 50 university…</p>

<p>You can come to the UK…</p>

<p>With virtually no conditions…</p>

<p>No job offer…</p>

<p>And stay here, with your family, for two years…</p>

<p>To just explore. Work. Study. Invent. Figure out what you want to do.</p>

<p>And that should send a strong and clear message to the brightest global talent:</p>

<p>If you come to the UK, we will back you to succeed.</p>

<p>Nothing like that exists anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>And it sums up our philosophy when it comes to visas:</p>

<p>Less ‘build it and they will come’, and more ‘let them come and they will build it’.</p>

<p>So, capital, people, and third – ideas.</p>

<p>The UK has less than 1% of the world’s population, but four of the world’s top 20 global universities.</p>

<p>The 2nd most Nobel laureates out of any nation.</p>

<p>The third highest number of research publications worldwide.</p>

<p>But we can’t be content to rest on our laurels.</p>

<p>We need to do more to support private sector R&amp;D.</p>

<p>And that includes tax.</p>

<p>On the face of it, we have one of the most generous tax regimes for R&amp;D investment anywhere, measured by how much we spend on it.</p>

<p>But despite spending huge and rapidly growing sums, clearly it is not working as well as it should.</p>

<p>In the UK, business spending on R&amp;D amounts to just three times the value of the R&amp;D tax relief.</p>

<p>The OECD average? 13 times.</p>

<p>So I will make sure that our tax regime for innovation is globally competitive and creates proper incentives for all of you to invest and invent.</p>

<p>And of course, the government will do our bit, too.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, we’re increasing government investment in R&amp;D by almost 50%.</p>

<p>As a % of GDP, that will put us above Germany, France, Israel, Canada, Japan, and the US.</p>

<p>And one technology that will become ever-more critical in the years to come – is advanced computing.</p>

<p>The extraordinary power of the emerging generation of super computers will change every aspect of our economy.</p>

<p>So I’m delighted to launch today, a new review into the future of compute.</p>

<p>Led by Professor Zoubin Ghahramani… [GAR-A-MAA-NEE]</p>

<p>AI Professor at the University of Cambridge and Director of Google Brain……</p>

<p>It will report later this year with recommendations for how we can deliver the UK’s computing needs not just this year, but for decades to come.</p>

<p>Let me close with one final thought.</p>

<p>My political opponents actually love to paint me as some kind of tech geek.</p>

<p>As I’m sure you’ve gathered this morning – that’s a label I’m actually proud of.</p>

<p>I will always be on the side of entrepreneurs, innovators, young people inventing the future.</p>

<p>Because the biggest lesson I took from my time in California still guides me now, as Chancellor.</p>

<p>What really matters for economic success – is innovation.</p>

<p>If we want our country to succeed, we need to do what we’ve always done and embrace new technologies, and the people and culture that creates them.</p>

<p>No serious analysis of our prospects could conclude anything different.</p>

<p>Because if we can get this right…</p>

<p>If we can back our capital, people, and ideas…</p>

<p>If we can encourage that incredible spirit I see everywhere in this country…</p>

<p>Then we can be confident that Britain stands on the cusp of a new era of innovation and change.</p>

<p>And ultimately, what gives me that confidence is standing here at this podium and looking out at all of you.</p>

<p>People of talent and ambition and imagination, searching relentlessly…</p>

<p>…for that next new idea that will shape our lives and change the world.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
