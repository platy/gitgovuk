<p>Since becoming Transport Secretary, I have worked consistently to raise the bar on motorway safety and I am determined to make sure people using our motorways continue to benefit from one of the safest and best-performing road networks in the world.</p>

<p>To this end, one of my first actions as Transport Secretary was to order a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-motorway-evidence-stocktake-and-action-plan" class="govuk-link">stocktake of smart motorways</a>. I also welcome the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/153/transport-committee/news/158468/transport-committee-pause-smart-motorway-rollout-until-safety-can-be-delivered-and-assured/">Transport Committee’s report published on 2 November 2021</a>, following their inquiry into the rollout and safety of smart motorways.</p>

<p>The Stocktake and Action Plan, which I published in March 2020, focused efforts on further upgrading the safety of smart motorways. I am pleased that these efforts have been recognised by the committee, which agreed that the government was right to focus on upgrading the safety of all lane running (<abbr title="all lane running">ALR</abbr>) smart motorways, rather than reinstating the hard shoulder – which the committee recognised could cause more deaths or serious injuries on our roads.</p>

<p>Having carefully considered the committee’s report, I will be taking forward all of its recommendations. This includes the recommendation to pause the rollout of future <abbr title="all lane running">ALR</abbr> smart motorway schemes until a full 5 years’ worth of safety data is available.</p>

<p>During the pause, we will continue to make sure all existing <abbr title="all lane running">ALR</abbr> smart motorways are equipped with best-in-class technology and resources and are as safe as they can possibly be.</p>

<p>I will also follow the recommendations to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pause the conversion of dynamic hard shoulder smart motorways to <abbr title="all lane running">ALR</abbr> until the next Road Investment Strategy</li>
  <li>retrofit more emergency areas across existing <abbr title="all lane running">ALR</abbr> schemes</li>
  <li>conduct an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of stopped vehicle detection technology</li>
  <li>explore the introduction of the emergency corridor manoeuvre to the Highway Code</li>
  <li>investigate the benefits of health and safety assessments being undertaken by the Office of Rail and Road.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken together, and building on my initial stocktake, these measures will ensure that our roads continue to be among the safest in the world – helping drivers not just to be safe, but crucially, to feel safe and confident when driving.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the Transport Committee’s scrutiny and to all those who provided evidence for their work. I will be instructing National Highways to take immediate steps to implement the actions as set out in the response and will update the committee on progress over the coming year.</p>
