<h3>Introduction: state of the war</h3>

<p>I beg to move… that this House has considered the situation in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin’s unprovoked, illegal war has now entered its third month.</p>

<p>Russian forces failed in their initial war aims.</p>

<p>They failed to take Kyiv and they have suffered heavy losses.</p>

<p>But Ukraine now faces a renewed offensive in the East and the South. And we are seeing atrocities in Mariupol, Odesa, and beyond.</p>

<p>We must double down in our response.</p>

<p>So far Putin’s planning has been riddled with misconceptions and miscalculations.</p>

<p>He was wrong about Ukraine’s strength and determination.</p>

<p>We must prove him wrong again in his expectations of our stamina and our commitment.</p>

<p>Our aim remains clear: Putin must lose in Ukraine.  And we will do everything we can to ensure that.</p>

<p>We know his ambitions don’t stop at Ukraine.</p>

<p>I am in constant contact with Allies and partners, urging more action.</p>

<p>That was the case I made to NATO and G7 Foreign Ministers earlier this month… and in every exchange I have with my counterparts around the world.</p>

<p>Since those meetings we’ve seen action in 3 areas…</p>

<h4>Lethal aid</h4>

<p>First of all, we are stepping up lethal aid.</p>

<p>The UK has always led this effort.</p>

<p>We have already supplied 6,000 anti-tank weapons and 120 armoured fighting vehicles, as well as ammunition, and other weapons.</p>

<p>We are helping other countries deliver equipment by providing logistics support.</p>

<p>We are also backfilling third countries’ stocks, for example offering to deploy British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland.</p>

<p>And we are training Ukrainian troops to use the new equipment.</p>

<p>Our allies are stepping up too.</p>

<p>For too long there was a false distinction between defensive and offensive weapons.</p>

<p>It became an excuse for some to drag their feet.</p>

<p>That time has now passed.</p>

<p>NATO allies are clear that we are delivering heavy weapons.</p>

<p>That is what Ukraine needs to halt the latest Russian initiative and to regain control over their territory.</p>

<h4>Sanctions</h4>

<p>Second, we are also relentlessly ramping up our economic action to choke off the funding for Putin’s war effort.</p>

<p>Again the UK is leading the way.</p>

<p>We have sanctioned more individuals and more organisations than any other nation.</p>

<p>So far we have designated over 1,500 individuals and entities.</p>

<p>Including over 100 oligarchs with assets worth over £198 billion.</p>

<p>We have put asset freezes on 18 major Russian banks - and like to see other countries follow - and barred over 3 million Russian companies from raising money on our capital markets.</p>

<p>These actions have been closely coordinated with the G7 and others.</p>

<p>We have also taken decisive action on trade – cutting Russia off from WTO terms and banning high tech exports to halt their technological development.</p>

<p>We have announced a ban on all new outward investment into Russia.</p>

<p>We cannot stop here.</p>

<p>We will keep increasing the pressure.</p>

<p>We need a new wave of sanctions.</p>

<h4>Diplomatic action</h4>

<p>Third, we are resolute in our diplomatic response.</p>

<p>We are reopening our Embassy in Kyiv.</p>

<p>I want to thank Ambassador Melinda Simmons and her team for their courage and action.</p>

<p>We are further isolating Putin on the world stage.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom led the diplomatic push to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council.</p>

<p>We are using our Presidency of the UN Security Council to expose Russia’s war crimes, appalling rape and sexual violence seen systematically used in Ukraine.</p>

<p>We gave President Zelenskyy a platform to detail the abhorrent crimes that have been committed by Putin’s forces.</p>

<p>And we have launched the Murad code to set the global standard for evidence gathering from sexual violence.</p>

<p>We’re also working with the 141 countries that voted to condemn Russia in the UN General Assembly to toughen our stance.</p>

<p>Russia is not serious about negotiations.</p>

<p>Any eventual settlement would need to secure both Ukrainian and European security.</p>

<p>Must be backed up by international enforcement – both economic and security.</p>

<p>The fact is that Russia simply can’t be trusted to follow through on what it signs up to.</p>

<p>There has to be full enforcement of any settlement that is eventually reached.</p>

<h4>Keeping Ukraine afloat</h4>

<p>While the war continues we also need to support the Ukrainian people.</p>

<p>We’re helping refugees, delivering food, medicine and other essentials, and helping to keep their economy afloat.</p>

<p>Our overall package of humanitarian, economic and military support is worth $2 billion.</p>

<p>I can confirm today that two convoys of more than 40 fire engines have now arrived in Ukraine, packed with rescue equipment.</p>

<p>And we are supplying 22 more ambulances to Ukraine – equipped with paramedic kits and medical grab bags.</p>

<p>We secured the World Bank’s largest ever financial commitment to low income countries to help them deal with rising food security and energy prices.</p>

<p>Throughout this crisis the generosity of the British people has been incredible.</p>

<p>They donated over £300 million to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, including the UK’s largest ever government aid-match of £25 million.</p>

<p>I have seen Ukrainian flags flying all over the country.</p>

<p>The British people are standing with Ukraine.</p>

<h4>Looking to the future</h4>

<p>When the war is finally over, we will continue to support a strong, sovereign Ukraine.</p>

<p>We will help to bolster their security against future threats.</p>

<p>To that end, we are working on a joint commission with Poland to ensure Ukraine has the means to defend itself in the longer term, including with NATO-standard weapons.</p>

<p>And we will all help Ukraine to rebuild.</p>

<p>I am determined to work with the US, EU and other partners on a new Marshall Plan for the country.</p>

<p>We need to see a landmark international effort to rebuild Ukraine’s towns and cities, regenerate their industries and secure their freedom.</p>

<p>We will also ensure that Putin and his regime are held to account for their crimes in Ukraine.</p>

<p>We led calls at the OSCE for an independent investigation.</p>

<p>It has reported “credible evidence” of torture, rape, the killing of civilians and the forced deportation of over half a million people.</p>

<p>We have referred Russia to the ICC. It is now backed by over 40 states.</p>

<p>We are providing additional funding to the Court, as well as UK personnel to provide technical assistance.</p>

<p>And we have appointed Sir Howard Morrison to support the Ukrainian Prosecutor General in her investigations.</p>

<p>This House can be assured that whatever it takes to bring the perpetrators to justice will be done.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The repulsive behaviour of Putin and his forces only strengthens our resolve to stand with Ukraine.</p>

<p>This is a battle for Ukraine’s freedom and sovereignty – and for the very principles of self-determination and the rule of law.</p>

<p>Ukraine must triumph.</p>

<p>We will not relent in our efforts until they do.</p>
