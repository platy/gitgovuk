<p>Your Excellency Noura Al Kaabi and your distinguished guests, good morning.</p>

<p>It’s fantastic to be here - and firstly, can I thank the UAE for hosting this wonderful event.</p>

<p>I’ve never been to anything quite like this before and I’m very proud that we’ve been able to bring you just a little bit of Britain and our UK Pavilion.</p>

<p>The UK and the UAE share a deep and historic bond.</p>

<p>We’re committed to tackling global issues together, and we’ve strengthened that relationship through our new and ambitious “Partnership for the Future” - which alongside our expanded UAE UK sovereign investment partnership, we’ll use to create new trade, and collaborate on a number of areas including life sciences, education, climate and security.</p>

<p>I’m here to strengthen that partnership even further and, on UK National Day, to celebrate everything that makes Britain great.</p>

<p>I might be biased, but there’s quite a list.</p>

<p>We’re the home of Shakespeare and Fleabag; Potter and Bond.</p>

<p>Adele and Ed Sheeran.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton and, as mentioned,  Stephen Hawking.</p>

<p>The birthplace of the man who invented the world wide web - changing life as we all know it.</p>

<p>And the country where the greatest game on earth, football, was invented.</p>

<p>It’s hard to condense thousands of years of literature and innovation, science and creativity into one single space - and so I’d recommend that people come and see it with their own eyes with a visit to the UK.</p>

<p>Our doors are wide open.</p>

<p>Thanks to our phenomenal vaccine and booster rollout, we’re one of the most open countries in Europe, with one of the strongest economies, too.</p>

<p>Just as the UAE has an excellent record on covid vaccination and it’s economy has remained strong throughout this pandemic, as has ours.</p>

<p>And we’re ready to give a very warm welcome to visitors in every single corner of the country - in what is set to be an incredibly exciting and historic year for the UK.</p>

<p>Firstly, we’re hosting one of the biggest events in the sporting calendar, the Commonwealth Games, in Birmingham.</p>

<p>And you might have spotted it, but today, on UK National Day, the Baton for the Commonwealth Games is taking a very special journey around the Expo site - carried by a number of inspiring Batonears.</p>

<p>It’s travelled all over the world before it makes its way to Birmingham for 11 days of incredible sport.</p>

<p>And after two years of hunkering down in our own countries to shelter from COVID, that little baton is a powerful physical symbol of the renewed ties between us - connecting us all, country by country.</p>

<p>Alongside Birmingham Commonwealth Games, in 2022, we’re also celebrating a festival of creativity, Unboxed, which will be enjoyed across the entire UK.</p>

<p>But most importantly, this year is the year, the UK is marking one very special occasion - the jewel in our crown of what is going to be an incredible year.</p>

<p>Now, I know the UAE has been celebrating its own Golden Jubilee.</p>

<p>But without one upmanship taking place here, this year our Queen will make history with her own Platinum Jubilee: marking the 70th  year of her reign.</p>

<p>No other British monarch has ever reached that milestone. Not Victoria, not Elizabeth I.</p>

<p>We’re going to put on a celebration to remember Her Majesty’s honour, with four days of parades and street parties, and all the very best of British pomp and pageantry the kind that I know we Brits do really well.</p>

<p>The UK will be absolutely buzzing this summer, the way it was when we hosted the Olympic Games in 2012.</p>

<p>And I cannot wait to welcome as many visitors there as possible for this once-in-a-lifetime moment in our history.</p>

<p>So consider this my invitation to everyone, to the entire Expo, to come and celebrate our Queen in this very special year.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
