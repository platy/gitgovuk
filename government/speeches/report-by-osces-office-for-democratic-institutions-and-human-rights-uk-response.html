<p>Madam Chair,</p>

<p>I wish to thank the Director of OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (<abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>), dear Matteo, for your presentation.  It was a reminder, at the end of another challenging year, of the importance of <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s work in helping participating States implement the OSCE’s unique concept of comprehensive security.
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-acknowledges-odihrs-work-at-30th-anniversary-event-14-to-15-october-2021" class="govuk-link">As we said in Warsaw in October when congratulating <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> for its 30 years of achievements</a> - your work to strengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law and human rights across the OSCE region has made, and continues to make, a tangible, positive difference to many.</p>

<p><abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s deployment of its 400th election observation mission this year was a noteworthy milestone.  That landmark is testament to the success of <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s impartial and facts based approach to observing elections which, rightly, treats elections as more than a one day event.  The UK continues to support <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s election observation methodology which ensures you can provide independent advice to help all participating States live up to our commitments - dating back to Copenhagen in 1990 – to hold periodic, genuine, free and fair elections.<br>
We disagree with the criticism of <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s methodology.  We have, as 57 participating States, provided <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> with a mandate to decide how to credibly and effectively observe elections.  For example, the use of expert Needs Assessment Missions as part of <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s methodology allows the Organization to decide in a transparent, professional and impartial manner, the requirements for election observation missions.  The consequence is that they will decide on different observation missions to meet different circumstances.</p>

<p>Whilst we congratulate <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> for deploying its 400th mission, we regret that not all participating States have cooperated as appropriate, and required, under our human dimension commitments.  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/uk-national-statement-to-the-2021-osce-ministerial-council" class="govuk-link">As the UK Foreign Secretary noted at the Ministerial Council</a>, there has been a lack of political will to follow through on our shared principles, and freedom and democracy have been under attack.</p>

<p>That makes it all the more important that <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> continues to have the staunch support of the overwhelming majority of participating States.  Political support and cooperation is, of course, crucial.  But so is support for <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s budget, which ensures that <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> has the funds needed to implement its mandate.  If participating States are serious in our commitment to the OSCE’s concept of comprehensive security, then we must truly value what <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> delivers.  Not attack its budget as part of an a la carte approach to the OSCE’s commitments and institutions.</p>

<p>Matteo – we look forward to your report in the Spring on <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr>’s 2021 activities.  In the meantime, thank you for the update to this Permanent Council, and for the continued hard work and dedication of all <abbr title="OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights">ODIHR</abbr> staff, and to helping us participating States uphold our human dimension commitments.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
