<p>Good afternoon everybody, thank you for joining us,</p>

<p>When I asked you to go into lockdown exactly a year ago</p>

<p>it seemed incredible that in the 21st Century</p>

<p>this was the only way to fight a new respiratory disease -</p>

<p>to stay at home</p>

<p>to avoid human contact</p>

<p>to shun so many of the patterns of behaviour that are most natural and obvious to all of us.</p>

<p>But we did it together</p>

<p>to protect the NHS</p>

<p>to save lives.</p>

<p>And for the entire British people it has been an epic of endurance and privation,</p>

<p>of children’s birthday parties cancelled</p>

<p>of weddings postponed</p>

<p>of family gatherings of all kinds simply deleted from the diary.</p>

<p>And worst of all in that time</p>

<p>We’ve suffered so many losses</p>

<p>and for so many people</p>

<p>our grief has been made more acute</p>

<p>because we have not been able to see our loved ones in their final days</p>

<p>to hold their hands</p>

<p>or even to mourn them together.</p>

<p>And at the right moment, we will come together as a country to build a fitting and a permanent memorial to the loved ones we have lost</p>

<p>and to commemorate this whole period.</p>

<p>For month after month our collective fight against Coronavirus was like fighting in the dark against a callous and invisible enemy,</p>

<p>until science helped us to turn the lights on and to gain the upper hand.</p>

<p>And I want to renew my thanks to everyone responsible for the astounding vaccine roll-out</p>

<p>which has enabled us to protect more than 28 million people across the whole of the United Kingdom with a first jab</p>

<p>and administer more than 30 million doses in total.</p>

<p>And I want to thank everybody for their courage, your courage, discipline and patience.</p>

<p>When people come to describe this epidemic to future generations,</p>

<p>we’ll tell the story of the heroes of the NHS and social care</p>

<p>of pharmacists, teachers, armed service personnel, shop workers, transport workers, the police and so many others.</p>

<p>But in the end this was unlike any other struggle in my lifetime, in that our entire population has been engaged,</p>

<p>and it’s thanks to all of you therefore that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom.</p>

<p>We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable,</p>

<p>and offering a first dose of the vaccine to every adult by the end of July.</p>

<p>And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab,</p>

<p>this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms.</p>
