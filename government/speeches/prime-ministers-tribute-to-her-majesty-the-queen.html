<p>Mr Speaker, in the hours since last night’s shocking news, we have witnessed the most heartfelt outpouring of grief at the loss of Her Late Majesty The Queen.</p>

<p>Crowds have gathered.</p>

<p>Flags have been lowered to half-mast.</p>

<p>Tributes have been sent from every continent around the world.</p>

<p>On the death of her father King George VI, Winston Churchill said the news had:</p>

<p>….”stilled the clatter and traffic of twentieth-century life in many lands.”</p>

<p>Now, 70 years later, in the tumult of the 21st century, life has paused again.</p>

<p>Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was one of the greatest leaders the world has ever known.</p>

<p>She was the rock on which modern Britain was built.</p>

<p>She came to the throne – at just 25 – in a country that was emerging from the shadow of war.</p>

<p>She bequeaths a modern, dynamic nation that has grown and flourished under her reign.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is the great country it is today because of her.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth is the family of nations it is today because of her.</p>

<p>She was devoted to the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>She served 15 countries as Head of State and she loved them all.</p>

<p>Her words of wisdom gave us strength in the most testing times.</p>

<p>During the darkest moments of the pandemic, she gave us hope that we would meet again.</p>

<p>She knew this generation of Britons would be as strong as any.</p>

<p>As we meet today, we remember the pledge she made on her 21st birthday to dedicate her life to service.</p>

<p>The whole House will agree: never has a promise been so completely fulfilled.</p>

<p>Her devotion to duty remains an example to us all.</p>

<p>She carried out thousands of engagements.</p>

<p>She took a red box every day.</p>

<p>She gave Her Assent to countless pieces of legislation,</p>

<p>and was at the heart of our national life for seven decades.</p>

<p>As Supreme Governor of the Church of England, she drew on her deep faith.</p>

<p>She was the nation’s greatest diplomat.</p>

<p>Her visits to post-apartheid South Africa and to the Republic of Ireland showed a unique ability to transcend difference and heal division.</p>

<p>In total she visited well over 100 countries.</p>

<p>She met more people than any other Monarch in our history.</p>

<p>She gave counsel to Prime Ministers and Ministers across government.</p>

<p>I have personally greatly valued her wise advice.</p>

<p>Only last October, I witnessed first-hand how she charmed the world’s leading investors at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>She was always so proud of Britain and always embodied the spirit of our great country.</p>

<p>She remained determined to carry out her duties even at the age of 96.</p>

<p>It was just three days ago at Balmoral that she invited me to form a government and become her 15th Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Again she generously shared with me her deep experience of government, even in those last days.</p>

<p>Everyone who met her will remember the moment.</p>

<p>They will speak of it for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Even for those who never met her, Her Late Majesty’s image is an icon for what Britain stands for as a nation - on our coins, on our stamps and in portraits around the world.</p>

<p>Her legacy will endure through the countless people she met,</p>

<p>the global history she witnessed,</p>

<p>and the lives that she touched.</p>

<p>She was loved and admired by people across the United Kingdom and across the world.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for that affection was her sheer humanity.</p>

<p>She re-invented the monarchy for the modern age.</p>

<p>She was a champion of freedom and democracy around the world.</p>

<p>She was dignified but not distant.</p>

<p>She was willing to have fun, whether on a mission with 007 or having tea with Paddington Bear.</p>

<p>She brought the monarchy into people’s lives and into people’s homes.</p>

<p>During her first televised Christmas message in 1957, she said:</p>

<p>“Today we need a special kind of courage…so we can show the world that we are not afraid of the future.”</p>

<p>We need that courage now.</p>

<p>In an instant, yesterday, our lives changed forever.</p>

<p>Today we show the world we do not fear what lies ahead.</p>

<p>We send our deepest sympathy to all members of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>We pay tribute to our late Queen, and we offer loyal service to our new King.</p>

<p>His Majesty King Charles III bears an awesome responsibility that he now carries for all of us.</p>

<p>I was grateful to speak to His Majesty last night and offer my condolences</p>

<p>Even as he mourns, his sense of duty and service is clear.</p>

<p>He has already made a profound contribution through his work on conservation, education, and his tireless diplomacy.</p>

<p>We owe him our loyalty and devotion.</p>

<p>The British people, the Commonwealth, and all of us in this House…</p>

<p>…will support him as he takes our country forward to a new era of hope and progress…</p>

<p>…our New Carolean age.</p>

<p>The Crown endures.</p>

<p>Our nation endures.</p>

<p>And in that spirit, I say: God save The King.</p>
