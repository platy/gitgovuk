<p>High Commissioner, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,</p>

<p>Two years on from the Global Refugee Forum, the picture remains sobering.</p>

<p>Since then, we have faced challenges that none of us had seen before.</p>

<p>The nightmare combination of conflict, COVID-19 and the climate crisis means the number of people forced from their homes is set to pass 100 million next year.</p>

<p>In a world in crisis, it is vital that we come together to help those in greatest need.</p>

<p>So I pay tribute to the generosity of host nations and communities who welcome those driven from their homes.</p>

<p>I recognise how difficult this can be, particularly in the face of lengthy crises, heightened by the pandemic.</p>

<p>I also commend the UNHCR staff who have worked tirelessly to stay and deliver, supporting refugees during this very challenging period.</p>

<p>I am proud that the UK has a strong track record of helping those who need our protection.</p>

<p>Our commitment to supporting refugees remains strong.</p>

<p>Our focus is on a holistic approach, restoring dignity and offering refugees a viable future.</p>

<p>We continue to play our part in delivering on the Global Compact.</p>

<p>This includes significant support to the world’s largest refugee crises.</p>

<p>We have provided £732 million since 2011 to support Syrian refugees and host communities.</p>

<p>In Jordan, our £216 million programme has helped to create small business opportunities and jobs for Syrians and Jordanians.</p>

<p>In Bangladesh, our £320 million response to the Rohingya crisis has provided lifesaving food assistance, health support and sanitation for refugees since 2017.</p>

<p>And in Uganda, we have a six-year, £210 million, programme supporting refugees and host communities.</p>

<p>To ensure refugee children have opportunities for a brighter future, we are helping 300,000 of them to continue their educations in ten countries.</p>

<p>Since 2015, we have resettled more than 25,000 men, women and children seeking refuge from persecution across the world.</p>

<p>We have issued more than 39,000 visas under the Refugee Family Reunion Rules – around half to children.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme will give up to 20,000 at-risk people a new life in the UK.</p>

<p>We stand firm in our commitment to the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>

<p>And I am encouraged by the wider commitment, at senior levels, demonstrated at our meeting today.</p>

<p>As COP presidents, the UK particularly welcomes the focus on climate change.</p>

<p>We are encouraged, too, that refugees are increasingly participating in the decisions that concern them.</p>

<p>This, of course, is vital.</p>

<p>We will continue to work with you – the UNHCR and our fellow member states – and with those at the very heart of our work.</p>

<p>Together, we will continue to drive progress and momentum towards achieving the goals of the Global Compact.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
