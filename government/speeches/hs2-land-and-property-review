<p>High Speed Two (<abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>) is at the heart of our plans to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic, creating 1000s of skilled jobs, boosting connectivity between our towns and cities and helping to rebalance opportunity across the country for years to come.</p>

<p>However, as part of that commitment to build back better, it’s crucial that we deliver <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> in a way that is as considerate as possible of those disrupted by the project, who may face losing their homes and relocating their businesses.</p>

<p>In confirming <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> would go ahead in February 2020, the Prime Minister also committed to a step-change in <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s performance and to drive improvements in transparency, accountability and value to the taxpayer. This included a renewed focus on placing people – the communities and individuals who will be impacted by <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> – at the heart of everything the government does.</p>

<p>So following my appointment as the Minister for <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>, I initiated a review of the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> land and property acquisition programme, to ensure that those most directly affected were placed at its heart.</p>

<p>The review examined <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd’s operational acquisition processes and, where the evidence demonstrated it, associated wider-government policies. It focussed on 4 areas. How to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliver a step-change in community engagement on the land and property acquisition programme</li>
  <li>protect the interests of those impacted</li>
  <li>improve process efficiency and delivery by <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd</li>
  <li>drive a better tone, showing conspicuous respect, courtesy and understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, I’m pleased to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hs2-land-and-property-review-2020" class="govuk-link">publish the findings of this review</a>. Copies of the report have been laid in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p>The government is grateful for the contributions made by Members of the House and their constituents, external stakeholders, the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Residents’ Commissioner and the <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Construction Commissioner. The review also considered lessons from Phase One of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> and examined compensation regimes employed on other UK infrastructure projects and abroad.</p>

<p>The review generated a number of proposals that are designed to speed up property valuations and disturbance payments, settle cases and disputes more quickly and build on the improvements <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd have been introducing to engage more effectively with people.</p>

<p>The focus now will be on how the government and <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr> Ltd turn these proposals into long-lasting changes that not only improve the delivery of <abbr title="High Speed Two">HS2</abbr>, but also the experience and well-being of individuals, businesses and communities impacted by them.</p>

<p>The government wants to ensure that those living near the route receive the right support at all stages of the project. Importantly, it remains committed to ensuring that those affected are properly compensated and treated with compassion, dignity and respect.</p>
