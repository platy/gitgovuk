<p>Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>The high inflation we are experiencing now is causing acute distress for the people of this country.</p>

<p>I know they are worried, I know people are struggling.</p>

<p>I want to explain what is happening, why it is happening, and what we propose to do about it.</p>

<p>I trust the British people, and I know they understand no government can solve every problem, particularly the complex and global challenge of inflation.</p>

<p>But this government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right – as we did throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>We need to make sure that for those whom the struggle is too hard…and for whom the risks are too great…they are supported.</p>

<p>This government will not sit idly by whilst there is a risk that some in our country might be set so far back… they might never recover.</p>

<p>This is simply unacceptable. I will never allow that happen.</p>

<p>And I want to reassure everybody – we will get through this.</p>

<p>We have the tools and the determination we need to combat and reduce inflation.</p>

<p>We will make sure the most vulnerable and the least well off get the support they need at this time of difficulty.</p>

<p>And we will turn this moment of difficulty into a springboard for economic renewal and growth.</p>

<p>With more jobs, higher skills, greater investment - our plan for a stronger economy.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>Before I turn to the details of our plan, let me put into context for the House, the challenge we face.</p>

<p>This country is now experiencing the highest rate of inflation we have seen for forty years.</p>

<p>The Bank of England expect inflation to average around 9% this year.</p>

<p>Our exposure to global shocks continues to explain most of the inflation above the 2% target.</p>

<p>Supply chain disruption as the world reopened from Covid…</p>

<p>…combined with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine…</p>

<p>…and potentially exacerbated by recent lockdowns in China…</p>

<p>…are all contributing to significant price increases for goods and energy.</p>

<p>However, over the course of this year, the situation has evolved and has become more serious.</p>

<p>There are areas of particular concern.</p>

<p>Even excluding energy and food, core inflation has become broader based and elevated.</p>

<p>Of the basket of goods and services we use to measure inflation, a record proportion are seeing above average price increases.</p>

<p>Also, we are acutely exposed to the European energy price shock and, like the US, we have a tight labour market.</p>

<p>Make no mistake – the lowest unemployment in almost 50 years, just months after averting a jobs crisis during the pandemic, is good news.</p>

<p>But combined with the shock to European energy prices, it does contribute to the UK’s relatively high rate of inflation.</p>

<p>And lastly, as the Bank have noted, longer-term inflation expectations have risen above their historical averages, by more than they are in the US and Europe.</p>

<p>We cannot and must not allow short term inflationary pressures to lead people to expect that high inflation will continue over the long term.</p>

<p>Because Madam Deputy Speaker</p>

<p>We can get inflation under control.</p>

<p>It is not some abstract force outside our grasp.</p>

<p>It may take time, but we have the tools we need and the resolve it will take to reduce inflation.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>We have three specific tools available to combat and reduce inflation – and we are using them all.</p>

<p>Independent monetary policy. Fiscal responsibility. And supply side activism.</p>

<p>First, our primary tool is a strong, independent monetary policy.</p>

<p>Since control of monetary policy was taken out of the hands of politicians 25 years ago, inflation has averaged precisely 2%.</p>

<p>It is right the Bank of England are independent.</p>

<p>And I know the Governor and his team will take decisive action to get inflation back on target and ensure inflation expectations remain firmly anchored.</p>

<p>Second, we need responsible fiscal policy.</p>

<p>That means providing fiscal support where required but not making the situation unnecessarily worse…causing inflation, interest, and mortgage rates to go up further than they otherwise would.</p>

<p>Excessively adding fiscal stimulus into a supply constrained economy…</p>

<p>…especially one in which households and businesses have built up over £300 billion of excess savings…</p>

<p>…risks being counterproductive and increasing inflationary pressures.</p>

<p>In other words, fiscal support should be timely, targeted, and temporary.</p>

<p>Timely, because we need to help people when the shock is at its worst.</p>

<p>Targeted, because unconstrained stimulus will make the problem worse.</p>

<p>And temporary, because if we do not meet our fiscal rules, and ensure the public finances are resilient in the longer run…</p>

<p>…we create even greater risks on inflation, interest rates, and the trend rate of economic growth.</p>

<p>And third, we are taking an activist approach to supply side reforms.</p>

<p>This will increase our productive capacity, ease inflationary pressures, and raise our long-term growth potential.</p>

<p>The PM’s energy security strategy will, over time, reduce bills by increasing energy supply and improving energy efficiency.</p>

<p>The W&amp;P Secretary is moving half a million jobseekers off welfare and into work…</p>

<p>…and doing more to support older people back into the jobs market.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary is making our visa regime for high-skilled migrants one of the most competitive in the world.</p>

<p>And, in the autumn, we will bring forward tax cuts and reforms to encourage businesses to invest more, train more, and innovate more – the path to higher growth.</p>

<p>So, independent monetary policy.</p>

<p>Fiscal responsibility.</p>

<p>Supply side reform.</p>

<p>The country should have confidence, that using these three tools…</p>

<p>…we will combat inflation – and reduce it over time.</p>

<p>But of course, we know that households are being hit hard, right now.</p>

<p>So today, Madam Deputy Speaker, we will provide significant support to the British people.</p>

<p>But as I have said, a critical part of how we are dealing with inflation is responsible fiscal policy.</p>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that as we support people more, we need to think about the fairest way to fund as much of that cost as possible.</p>

<p>The oil and gas sector is making extraordinary profits.</p>

<p>Not as the result of recent changes to risk taking or innovation or efficiency.</p>

<p>But as the result of surging global commodity prices – driven in part by Russia’s war.</p>

<p>And for that reason, I am sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly.</p>

<p>But as ever, there is a sensible middle ground.</p>

<p>We should not be ideological about this…we should be pragmatic.</p>

<p>It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly…and incentivise investment.</p>

<p>And so, like previous governments, including Conservative ones – we will introduce a temporary, targeted, Energy Profits Levy.</p>

<p>But, we have built into the new Levy a new Investment Allowance, similar to the super-deduction…</p>

<p>…that means companies will have a new and significant incentive to reinvest their profits.</p>

<p>The new Levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25%.</p>

<p>It will be temporary, and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels, the Levy will be phased out – and with a sunset clause written into the legislation.</p>

<p>And, crucially, with our new investment allowance, we are nearly doubling the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies.</p>

<p>This means that, for every £1 a company invests, they’ll get back 90 per cent in tax relief.</p>

<p>So the more a company invests, the less tax they will pay.</p>

<p>And we understand that certain parts of the electricity generation sector are also making extraordinary profits.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the way our market works.</p>

<p>The price electricity generators are paid is linked not to the costs they incur in providing that electricity…but rather to the price of natural gas – which is extraordinarily high right now.</p>

<p>Other countries like France, Italy, Spain and Greece have already taken measures to correct this.</p>

<p>As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, we are consulting with the power generation sector and investors…</p>

<p>…to drive forward energy market reforms and ensure that the price paid for electricity is more reflective of the costs of production.</p>

<p>Those reforms will take time to implement.</p>

<p>So, in the meantime, we are urgently evaluating the scale of these extraordinary profits…and the appropriate steps to take.</p>

<p>So, Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>Our Energy Profits Levy will encourage investment, not deter it.</p>

<p>It raises around £5bn revenue over the next year so that we can help families with the cost of living.</p>

<p>And it avoids having to increase our debt burden further.</p>

<p>Because there is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt to pay…</p>

<p>…because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions.</p>

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>I know the whole House will agree we have a responsibility to help those who…</p>

<p>…through no fault of their own…</p>

<p>…are paying the highest price for the inflation we face.</p>

<p>To help with the cost of living, we are going to provide significant, targeted support to millions of the most vulnerable people in our society:</p>

<p>Those on the lowest incomes, pensioners, and disabled people.</p>

<p>First, people on the lowest incomes.</p>

<p>Over eight million households already have incomes low enough for the state to be supporting their cost of living through the welfare system.</p>

<p>They could be temporarily unemployed and looking for work.</p>

<p>Unable to work because of long-term sickness or disability.</p>

<p>Or on low pay and using benefits to top up their wages.</p>

<p>Right now, they face incredibly difficult choices.</p>

<p>So, I can announce today we will send, directly to around eight million of the lowest income households, a one-off Cost of Living Payment of £650.</p>

<p>Support worth over £5bn to give vulnerable people certainty that we are standing by them at this challenging time.</p>

<p>DWP will make the payment in two lump sums - the first from July, the second in autumn, with payments from HMRC for those on Tax Credits, following shortly after.</p>

<p>There is no need for people to fill out complicated forms or bureaucracy – we will send the payment straight into their bank accounts.</p>

<p>Our policy will benefit over eight million households in receipt of means-tested benefits, from July.</p>

<p>Uprating, in that time frame, could only be done for those on Universal Credit.</p>

<p>And our policy will provide a larger average payment this year of £650.</p>

<p>Whereas uprating the same benefits by 9% would only be worth, on average, £530.</p>

<p>There are two further groups who will need targeted extra support.</p>

<p>Many pensioners are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs.</p>

<p>They can’t always increase their incomes through work.</p>

<p>And, because they spend more time at home, and are more vulnerable, they often need to keep the heating on for longer.</p>

<p>And we estimate many people who are eligible for Pension Credit are not currently claiming it…</p>

<p>…which means there will be many vulnerable pensioners not receiving means-tested benefits.</p>

<p>So, I can announce today that, from the autumn, we will send over eight million pensioner households who receive the Winter Fuel Payment – an extra, one-off Pensioner Cost of Living Payment of £300.</p>

<p>Disabled people also face extra costs in their day-to-day lives – like having energy-intensive equipment around the home or workplace.</p>

<p>So, to help the 6 million people who receive non-means tested disability benefits, we will send them, from September…</p>

<p>…an extra, one-off Disability Cost of Living Payment, worth £150.</p>

<p>Many disabled people will also receive the payment of £650 I have already announced, taking their total cost of living payments to £800.</p>

<p>And I can reassure the House that next year, subject to the Secretary of State’s review, benefits will be uprated by this September’s CPI…</p>

<p>…which, on current forecasts, is likely to be significantly higher than the forecast inflation rate for next year.</p>

<p>Similarly, the triple lock will apply for the state pension.</p>

<p>Of course, we recognise the risk that, as with any policy, there may be small numbers of people who fall between the cracks.</p>

<p>For example, it is not possible right now for DWP or HMRC to identify people on Housing Benefit who are not also claiming other benefits.</p>

<p>So, to support them and others, we will extend the Household Support Fund, delivered by Local Authorities, by £500m from October.</p>

<p>This is a significant set of interventions to support the most vulnerable in our country.</p>

<p>We will legislate to deliver this support on the same terms in every part of the United Kingdom – including Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>And, taken together, our direct cash payments, will help one third of all UK households with the cost of living, support worth over £9bn.</p>

<p>So, Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>We are meeting our responsibility to provide the most help to those on the lowest incomes.</p>

<p>I believe that is fair and I’m confident the House would agree.</p>

<p>But there are many other families who do not require state support in normal times.</p>

<p>They are also facing challenging times.</p>

<p>Is it fair to leave them unsupported?</p>

<p>The answer must surely be no.</p>

<p>While it is impossible for any government to solve every problem, we can and will ease the burden as we help the entire country through the worst of this crisis.</p>

<p>So, we will provide more support with the rising cost of energy – and that support will be universal.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we announced £9bn to help with the cost of energy.</p>

<p>Including a Council Tax rebate of £150 for tens of millions of households.</p>

<p>And we plan to provide all households with £200 off their energy bills from October, with the cost of that repaid over the following five years.</p>

<p>Since then, the outlook for energy prices has changed.</p>

<p>I’ve heard people’s concerns about the impact of these repayments on future bills.</p>

<p>So I have decided that those repayments will be cancelled.</p>

<p>So, for the avoidance of doubt, this support is unambiguously a grant.</p>

<p>And furthermore, I have decided that the £200 of support for household energy bills will be doubled to £400 for everyone.</p>

<p>We’re on the side of hard-working families, with £6bn of financial support.</p>

<p>So, Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>

<p>To summarise.</p>

<p>Our strategy is to combat and reduce inflation over time through independent monetary policy, fiscal responsibility, and supply side activism.</p>

<p>We are raising emergency funds to help millions of the most vulnerable families who are struggling right now.</p>

<p>And all households will benefit from universal support for energy bills of £400 – with not a penny to repay.</p>

<p>In total, the measures I’ve announced today provide support worth £15bn.</p>

<p>Combined with the plans we’ve already announced…that means we are supporting families with the cost of living to the tune of £37bn or 1.5% of GDP.</p>

<p>That’s higher or similar to countries like France, Germany, and Italy.</p>

<p>And I’m proud to say that around three quarters of the total support will go to vulnerable households.</p>

<p>As a result of the measures we’ve announced today, and the action we’ve already taken this year:</p>

<p>The vast majority of households will receive £550.</p>

<p>Pensioners will receive £850.</p>

<p>And almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households in the country will, in total, receive support of at least £1,200.</p>

<p>Let me put this into context.</p>

<p>The House will have noted the news from Ofgem earlier this week.</p>

<p>They currently expect the energy price cap to rise in October to £2,800.</p>

<p>That’s an average increase in people’s bills this year of just under £1,200.</p>

<p>The same amount our policies will provide for the most vulnerable this year.</p>

<p>I know there are other pressures.</p>

<p>I am not trying to claim we have solved the entire problem for everyone.</p>

<p>No government could.</p>

<p>But I hope that when people hear the significant steps we are taking…</p>

<p>…the millions we are helping…</p>

<p>…they will feel some of the burden eased, some of the pressures lifted.</p>

<p>And they will know, this Government is standing by them.</p>

<p>And Madam Deputy Speaker in conclusion,</p>

<p>Supporting people with the cost of living is only one part of our plan for a stronger economy…</p>

<p>…A plan that is creating more jobs…</p>

<p>…Cutting taxes for working people…</p>

<p>…Reducing our borrowing and debt…</p>

<p>…Driving businesses to invest and innovate more…</p>

<p>…unleashing a skills revolution…</p>

<p>…Seizing the benefits of Brexit…</p>

<p>…And levelling up growth in all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The British people can trust this government because we have a plan for a stronger economy and I commend this Statement to the House.</p>
