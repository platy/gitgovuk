<p>Thank you, Madam President, and thank you to our briefers. Ms Shawky, your words eloquently capture the universal hopes of the Yemeni people and - along with the continued warnings from Mr Lowcock that Yemen is on the brink not just of a devastating famine, but a prolonged starvation - are why ending the conflict in Yemen is a priority for the UK and why it should be a priority for the world.</p>

<p>We urgently need an opportunity to advance peace. We need, as we have heard, an end to fighting, a nationwide ceasefire, and an inclusive political process that ends the conflict. The UK is grateful to Special Envoy Griffiths for his tireless work and for his renewed efforts in recent weeks.</p>

<p>But despite recent efforts, the Houthis have, as Resolution 2564 warns, escalated military attacks, intensifying attacks on Saudi Arabia and on Marib. Their actions are making the humanitarian crisis worse. With 140,000 people already displaced from Marib, the UK strongly condemns these escalations, as we did in a joint statement with France, Germany, Italy and the US last week.</p>

<p>We are also concerned about reports of protesters storming the presidential palace in Aden today and reports of security forces firing on protesters in Seyoun yesterday. We call for restraint from both protesters and security forces.</p>

<p>We also remain deeply concerned by the grave threat posed by the SAFER oil tanker. The Houthis most urgently implement the multiple Security Council calls for them to facilitate the UN assessment and repair mission.</p>

<p>We also call on the Houthis to ensure a transparent and independent investigation into the Houthi-run migrant centre fire in Sana’a, including the involvement of the Houthi Security Service. Scores may have died. International agencies must have unrestricted access to the site and to those injured. The Houthis’ treatment of migrants must improve.</p>

<p>Humanitarian aid must not be used as a political tool. In line with Security Council Resolutions 2451 and 2417, we call on all parties to facilitate unhindered humanitarian access and to ensure that humanitarian workers are able to continue their work safely and without harm. It is also critical that imports flow into the port of Hodeidah and that vital onward supply routes remain open. We call on the Government of Yemen to immediately approve fuel ships to enter northern ports. Significant external financial assistance is also needed to enable affordable food imports.</p>

<p>The UK continues to be a leading donor to Yemen. We have so far pledged $120 million to the 2021 appeal. This will feed an additional 240,000 of the most vulnerable Yemenis every month and provide clean water for 1.6 million people.</p>

<p>Thank you, Madam President.</p>
