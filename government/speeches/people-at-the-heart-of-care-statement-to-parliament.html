          <div class="govspeak">
<p>With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on our plans for adult social care.</p>

<p>Today we are publishing our ambitious 10-year vision for adult social care – our white paper <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform-white-paper" class="govuk-link">People at the Heart of Care</a>. It is a product of years of work, not only by every level of government, but by many involved in the sector, including people who give care, people who draw on care, and their families. I wish once again to underline my appreciation and admiration for everyone who works to deliver this most vital of public services, especially through this challenging pandemic.</p>

<p>Those working in social care – both paid and unpaid – deserve our deepest respect, yet they also deserve a system that works for them, and it is fair to say that that has not always been the case. Time and again, we in this House have heard about the challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the high turnover in the workforce</li>
  <li>the lottery of how people pay for care</li>
  <li>unsustainable local markets</li>
  <li>the varying quality and safety of care</li>
  <li>the low uptake of technology</li>
  <li>those carers who are not just unpaid, but under-appreciated; and</li>
  <li>the complexity of the system for everyone involved</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure honourable members will have their own challenges to add to that list. Make no mistake, these are complex issues – so complex, of course, that successive governments, over decades, have decided to duck rather than deal with them. This government, however, are determined to get it right. After all, we cannot be serious about levelling up unless we are also serious about social care.</p>

<p>In September, we took a vital first step on the road to fixing this generational problem when the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Secretary of State announced our new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-levy" class="govuk-link">Health and Social Care Levy</a>. The focus on how we must pay for it is absolutely right, but we were clear then, and we are clear now, that there is much else we need to do. 
The white paper contains more detail on what we plan to do over the next 3 years to transform the sector over the next decade. It is underpinned by 3 core principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>That everybody has choice, control and support to live independent lives</li>
  <li>That everyone can access outstanding personalised care and support; and</li>
  <li>That adult social care is fair and accessible for everyone who needs it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The principles we hold are important, but we know we will ultimately be judged on our actions. I will therefore set out some of those actions before the House.</p>

<p>First, giving everyone the choice, control and support to live independent lives requires both physical and digital infrastructure. We are investing £300 million in housing. That investment will support local authorities to increase the range of new supported housing options because it is vital that people live in homes that meet their needs and give them the independence they require. Moreover, we are setting up a new practical support service to help people with minor repairs and changes, which will help them to live independently for longer. That is in addition to increasing the upper limit of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disabled-facilities-grants" class="govuk-link">Disabled Facilities Grant</a> for home adaptations, which includes things such as stairlifts, wet rooms and home technology.</p>

<p>The digital infrastructure we put in place can be equally transformational, because we know that digital tools and technology can support independent living and improve the quality of care. We are therefore putting at least £150 million of funding to drive the greater adoption of such technology, with the ambition to achieve widespread digitisation across social care. We are setting up a new national website, which will explain all the upcoming changes, and we are piloting innovative new ways to help people understand and access the care and support they need.</p>

<p>Our second principle is to ensure outstanding personalised care and support, and at the heart of that is looking after the people who work in care. We are spending at least half a billion pounds on the social care workforce over the next 3 years. Some of those funds will help us to deliver new qualifications and better career routes in care, which we know is crucial for holding on to our caring and compassionate workforce. We are also directing funds into stronger mental health and wellbeing support for care staff because colleagues cannot care for people unless we care for colleagues.</p>

<p>We are putting funds behind a change in the services we provide to support unpaid carers, and we will find and test what works best for those who are caring under challenging circumstances. Regardless of whether that solution is old or new, if it works, we want to do it. We are also considering funding local areas to support their efforts to innovate around the care they provide, so that they can provide more options that suit people’s individual needs. Those new models of care, including housing-with-care, have the potential to play a pivotal role in delivering care that promotes prevention, is more personalised, and enables people to live independently.</p>

<p>Our third principle is care that is fair and accessible for everyone. We are introducing a cap on care costs so that no one will have to pay more than £86,000 over their lifetime. That cap will be there for everybody, regardless of any conditions they have, how old they are or how much they earn. It is a universal cap. Importantly, it will provide everyone with the peace of mind of knowing that the days of unlimited and unpredictable costs are coming to an end. The reforms will also make the existing means test far more generous, compared with both the current system and with previous abandoned proposals. Crucially, the £100,000 upper capital limit will be available to those in home care, and we expect many more people to be in home care. Let me be clear: no one will be worse off compared with the current system, and many, many people will be better off.</p>

<p>All the ambitious plans that we are setting out today must be underpinned by a sustainable care market. The £3.6 billion we are giving to reform the social care charging system will help all local authorities to pay a fairer rate for care, and put back into the system the fairness we all want.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, allow me to put on record once again my thanks to everybody who has played their part in developing this important white paper. The reform of social care in this country has been ducked for far too long, but we will do whatever it takes to take on this tough challenge, and we will get it right.</p>

<p>Today’s white paper is an important step on our journey to giving more people the dignified care that we want for our loved ones, setting out important changes that will last for generations and stand the test of time. As a government, we are determined to get this right – I am determined to get this right – so that we can build the healthier, fairer and more caring country that we all deserve.</p>

<p>I commend this statement to the House.</p>
