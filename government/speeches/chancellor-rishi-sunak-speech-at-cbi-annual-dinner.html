<p>Good evening everybody, it’s fantastic to be with you here today.</p>

<p>It’s a great privilege to address this distinguished audience for the first time in fact since I became Chancellor two and a half years ago.</p>

<p>So let me take this opportunity to say thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your support. Your advice. Your challenge.</p>

<p>The country is not going to become wealthy and prosperous solely because of the things that I do.</p>

<p>Change doesn’t happen behind a desk in Whitehall. Not even the Chancellor’s desk. It comes from all of you.</p>

<p>When your businesses invest, things get built.</p>

<p>When you train someone, they excel.</p>

<p>When you invent new products and services that people want to buy, you change the world.</p>

<p>That insight is at the centre of my economic outlook.</p>

<p>Now I know there are sometimes frustrations and frictions. We won’t always completely agree or go as far as you would like.</p>

<p>But you must never, ever doubt that I and the government on your side.</p>

<p>You asked for more generous capital allowances.</p>

<p>So we introduced the biggest two-year business tax cut in modern British history: the super deduction.</p>

<p>You asked for more flexibility over apprenticeships.</p>

<p>We’re delivering, with lots of improvements including new flexible training models.</p>

<p>You asked us to cut business rates.</p>

<p>We’re providing a discount of 50% for shops, restaurants, gyms; any business in retail, hospitality, or leisure.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s more to do.</p>

<p>But I do want to take this moment to celebrate the partnership between this Government and all of you.</p>

<p>This is very personal for me.</p>

<p>I remember my very early days as Chancellor.</p>

<p>Sitting at my desk in the Treasury in those first few days and weeks, reading the daily Covid case numbers by the light of my desk lamp.</p>

<p>I was feeling an almost overwhelming sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>It was a privilege and a relief to be able to call people like Carolyn and Rain at the CBI for advice.</p>

<p>Just as it is a privilege and a relief now to be able to call on Tony.</p>

<p>Under yours and Karan’s leadership the CBI continues to be what it has always been: a vital role and voice in our public life.</p>

<p>Please join me in thanking them for their extraordinary contribution.</p>

<p>Rarely has your leadership been needed more than now.</p>

<p>I hardly need to tell this audience that the economic situation is extremely serious.</p>

<p>A perfect storm of global supply shocks is rolling through our economy simultaneously.</p>

<p>Global demand – shifting last year from services to goods and exacerbating supply chain bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine - causing energy and commodity prices to spike severely.</p>

<p>And now a fresh wave of lockdowns in China - disrupting industrial production and adding to widespread backlogs in freight and in shipping.</p>

<p>Now while these are global forces, they are hitting families and businesses here at home.</p>

<p>Just this morning figures show that in April, CPI was 9%.</p>

<p>The Bank of England now expect inflation to peak at 10% later this year.</p>

<p>And those inflationary pressures are starting to weigh on growth.</p>

<p>Let me set out the way through this. Let me tell you the plan.</p>

<p>A plan to help people with the cost of living. And a plan for growth.</p>

<p>First, our plan to help with the cost of living.</p>

<p>It is the Bank of England’s role to control inflation. And they are rightly independent.</p>

<p>Over the quarter century since we took monetary policy out of the hands of politicians, inflation has averaged precisely 2%.</p>

<p>And I know the Governor and his team are completely focused on getting inflation back to target.</p>

<p>Our role in government is to help cut costs for families.</p>

<p>I cannot pretend this will be easy.</p>

<p>As I told the House of Commons yesterday:</p>

<p>There is no measure that any government could take, no law we could pass, that can make these global forces disappear overnight.</p>

<p>The next few months will be tough.</p>

<p>But where we can act, we will.</p>

<p>We are providing £22 billion of direct support.</p>

<p>With fuel duty – cut by 5p a litre.</p>

<p>Council tax – cut by £150.</p>

<p>The Warm Homes Discount – increased to £150.</p>

<p>We’re making work pay by increasing the National Living Wage and cutting the Universal Taper rate.</p>

<p>And in just a few weeks’ time, we’ll increase the National Insurance threshold to £12,500 – a £6billion tax cut for 30 million working people.</p>

<p>Because tackling high inflation is not just an economic necessity.</p>

<p>It is a social and moral necessity.</p>

<p>Those who suffer most are not the wealthiest, who can find ways to protect themselves.</p>

<p>It is always the poor.</p>

<p>Our policy to date has focused on supporting people in work and I make no apology for that.</p>

<p>There is nobility in work. It is the best way out of poverty.</p>

<p>And I’m proud that under this government, it always pays to work.</p>

<p>But right now, we also have a collective responsibility to help the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

<p>And so, as the situation evolves our response will evolve.</p>

<p>I have always been clear, we stand ready to do more.</p>

<p>At the same time, we need to be careful.</p>

<p>As Tony rightly warned us this week, at a time of severe supply restrictions, an unconstrained fiscal stimulus does risk making the problem worse.</p>

<p>By pushing up prices still further.</p>

<p>Embedding high inflation expectations.</p>

<p>And creating a vicious cycle of even higher interest rates and more pain for tens of millions of mortgage holders and small businesses.</p>

<p>So even as we protect people from the worst of the crisis, we must continue to be responsible with the public finances and get borrowing sustainably under control and debt falling.</p>

<p>So our plan will deal with the immediate impacts of inflation.</p>

<p>Cutting costs for families. Cutting the deficit.</p>

<p>And we are also growing the economy.</p>

<p>Over the long-term, higher productivity is the only way to raise living standards.</p>

<p>To do that, we will build on our enduring strengths.</p>

<p>In the UK, our children are some of the best educated in the world.</p>

<p>Our incredible universities produce the third highest number of publications worldwide and we have the second most Nobel Laureates of any nation.</p>

<p>Our artists, musicians, game designers, and filmmakers are creating work that is defining our era.</p>

<p>Our economy has decarbonised quicker than anyone else over the last twenty years.</p>

<p>Our deep and liquid capital markets finance the world’s commerce.</p>

<p>Our start-ups attract more venture capital than France and Germany combined.</p>

<p>Our language is the international language of business.</p>

<p>Our agile and flexible regulation is the model for others.</p>

<p>I could go on and on.</p>

<p>But we need to be honest.</p>

<p>We also need to overcome our longstanding weaknesses in investment, skills, and innovation.</p>

<p>Even in the decade before the global financial crisis, capital investment had weakened.</p>

<p>Research from the Resolution Foundation and the LSE shows that lower capital per hour worked explains around half our productivity gap with France and Germany.</p>

<p>On skills, our school and university performance has improved dramatically.</p>

<p>But four in five of our 2030 workforce are already in work.</p>

<p>So if we want to raise productivity in this country we need to do more to support those already in work.</p>

<p>And, since the financial crisis, the rate of increase in innovation has slowed considerably.</p>

<p>A weakness that explains almost our entire productivity gap with the United States.</p>

<p>So why is this happening? The problem I don’t believe is any longer the government.</p>

<p>Public sector net investment is reaching its highest sustained level since the 1970s.</p>

<p>Yet capital investment by UK businesses, as a % of GDP, is a lot lower than the OECD average.</p>

<p>Government funding for post-16 education is increasing, the Prime Minister has announced a lifelong learning entitlement, alongside a plethora of new skills initiatives like Skills Bootcamps and T levels.</p>

<p>But UK employers spend just half the European average training their employees.</p>

<p>And over this Parliament, we in government are delivering our pledge to increase public investment in research and development by 50% to £22 billion.</p>

<p>But businesses investment in R&amp;D, as a % of GDP, is less than half the OECD average.</p>

<p>In other words, further government action can only take us so far. We need you.</p>

<p>The wealth creators. The entrepreneurs. The leaders.</p>

<p>We need you to invest more, train more, and innovate more.</p>

<p>And as I’ve said previously, our firm plan is to reduce and reform your taxes to encourage you to do all those things.</p>

<p>That is the path to higher productivity, higher living standards, and a more prosperous and secure future.</p>

<p>One of the biggest debates in economics right now is about whether the world is facing a great slowing down.</p>

<p>Will we ever see again the kind of transformation that came from the introduction of railways to transport people and goods and ideas;</p>

<p>Cables and pylons to carry electricity into factories and homes;</p>

<p>Machines that freed people from backbreaking labour?</p>

<p>It is easy to look at the challenges we face now and feel disheartened.</p>

<p>But I am not. I believe our most exciting companies are still to be founded.</p>

<p>Our most talented people are still to be taught.</p>

<p>Our best ideas are still to be discovered.</p>

<p>Our best days lie ahead.</p>

<p>Government alone cannot get us there.</p>

<p>It will take all of us, together.</p>

<p>But we can get there. So let’s get to work.</p>
