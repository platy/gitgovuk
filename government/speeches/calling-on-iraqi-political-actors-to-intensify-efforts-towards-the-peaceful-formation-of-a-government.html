<p>Thank you, Madam President.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom commends the continued work of the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq and the work of SRSG Hennis-Plasschaert. I also welcome our Iraqi colleagues in the Chamber today.</p>

<p>I wish to make four points.</p>

<p>First, we welcome the successful ratification of Iraq’s election results and the steps taken towards government formation. We condemn the recent rise in attacks against political parties, and echo the SRSG’s call for all Iraqi political actors to work towards a peaceful and constructive post-election environment, and, most importantly, towards a government that can deliver for the Iraqi people. We commend UNAMI’s continued support to the Independent High Electoral Commission, and to the Electoral Commission’s post-election review.</p>

<p>Second, we commend the increased participation of women as both candidates and as voters in Iraq’s election, and call for the meaningful representation of women in Iraq’s next government. We urge the swift adoption of the draft Anti-Domestic Violence Law as a crucial protection against women.</p>

<p>Third, our collective efforts to secure the lasting defeat of Daesh remain essential. The Global Coalition continues to stand alongside the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to tackle the Daesh threat. The UK welcomes the commitment of the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to enhance their security cooperation to eradicate the Daesh threat.</p>

<p>Finally, we thank the SRSG for her update on missing Kuwaiti and third country nationals and missing Kuwaiti property. The progress made on the identification of remains of missing persons represents an important step forward. We commend the commitment of Iraq and Kuwait to continued cooperation on this important matter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we call on all Iraqi political actors to intensify their efforts to support the peaceful formation of a government that can deliver for all Iraqis.  And we call on the international community to be ready to support that government in tackling the pressing challenges it will face – in providing security, delivering services, reforming the economy, and moving away from dependence on hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
