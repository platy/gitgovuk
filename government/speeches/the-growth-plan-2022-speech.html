          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Let me start directly with the issue most worrying the British people – the cost of energy.</p>

<p>People will have seen the horrors of Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>They will have heard reports that their already-expensive energy bills could reach as high as £6,500 next year.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, we were never going to let this happen.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has acted with great speed to announce one of the most significant interventions the British state has ever made.</p>

<p>People need to know that help is coming.</p>

<p>And help is indeed coming.</p>

<p>We are taking three steps to support families and businesses with the cost of energy.</p>

<p>Firstly, to help households, the Energy Price Guarantee will limit the unit price that consumers pay for electricity and gas.</p>

<p>This means that for the next two years, the typical annual household bill will be £2,500.</p>

<p>For a typical household, that is a saving of at least £1,000 a year, based on current prices.</p>

<p>We are continuing our existing plans to give all households £400 off bills this winter.</p>

<p>So taken together, Mr Speaker, we are cutting everyone’s energy bills by an expected £1,400 this year.</p>

<p>And millions of the most vulnerable households will receive additional payments, taking their total savings this year to £2,200.</p>

<p>Secondly, as well as helping people, we need to support the businesses who employ them.</p>

<p>The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will reduce wholesale gas and electricity prices for all UK businesses, charities, and the public sector like schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>This will provide a price guarantee equivalent to the one provided for households, for all businesses across the country.</p>

<p>Thirdly, energy prices are  extremely volatile, erratically rising and falling every hour.</p>

<p>This creates real risks to energy firms who are otherwise viable businesses.</p>

<p>Those firms help supply the essential energy needed by households and businesses.</p>

<p>So to support the market, we are announcing the Energy Markets Financing Scheme.</p>

<p>Delivered with the Bank of England, this scheme will provide a 100% guarantee for commercial banks to offer emergency liquidity to energy traders.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The consensus amongst independent forecasters is that the Government’s energy plan will reduce peak inflation by around 5 percentage points.</p>

<p>It will reduce the cost of servicing index-linked government debt and lower wider cost of living pressures.</p>

<p>And it will help millions of people and businesses right across the country with the cost of energy.</p>

<p>Let no one doubt: during the worst energy crisis in generations, this Government is on the side of the British people.</p>

<p>The Bank of England are taking further steps to control inflation, acting again only yesterday.</p>

<p>I can assure the House, this Government considers the Bank of England’s independence to be sacrosanct.</p>

<p>And we remain closely coordinated, with the Governor and myself speaking twice a week.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>High energy costs are not the only challenge confronting this country.</p>

<p>Growth is not as high as it should be.</p>

<p>This has made it harder to pay for public services, requiring taxes to rise.</p>

<p>In turn, higher taxes on capital and labour have lowered returns on investment and work, reducing economic incentives and hampering growth still further.</p>

<p>This cycle has led to the tax burden being forecast to reach the highest levels since the late 1940s – before even Her Late Majesty acceded to the throne.</p>

<p>We are determined to break that cycle.</p>

<p>We need a new approach for a new era, focused on growth.</p>

<p>Our aim, over the medium term, is to reach a trend rate of growth of 2.5%.</p>

<p>And our plan is to expand the supply side of the economy through tax incentives and reform.</p>

<p>That is how we will deliver higher wages, greater opportunities, and crucially, fund public services, now and into the future.</p>

<p>That is how we will compete successfully with dynamic economies around the world.</p>

<p>That is how we will turn the vicious cycle of stagnation into a virtuous cycle of growth.</p>

<p>So as a Government, we will focus on growth – even where that means taking difficult decisions.</p>

<p>None of this is going to happen overnight. But today we are publishing our Growth Plan that sets out a new approach for this new era, built around three central priorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reforming the supply-side of the economy.</li>
  <li>Maintaining responsible approach to public finances</li>
  <li>And cutting taxes to boost growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The UK has the second-lowest debt to GDP ratio of any G7 country.</p>

<p>In due course, we will publish a Medium-Term Fiscal Plan, setting out our responsible fiscal approach more fully.</p>

<p>Including how we plan to reduce debt as a percentage of GDP over the medium term.</p>

<p>And the OBR will publish a full economic and fiscal forecast before the end of the year, with a second to follow in the new year.</p>

<p>Fiscal responsibility remains  essential for economic confidence, and it is a path we remain committed to.</p>

<p>Today we are publishing costings of all the measures the Government has taken.</p>

<p>And those costings will be incorporated into the OBR’s forecast in the usual way.</p>

<p>The House should note that the estimated costs of our energy plans are particularly uncertain, given volatile energy prices.</p>

<p>But based on recent prices, the total cost of the energy package, for the six months from October, is expected to be around £60bn.</p>

<p>We expect the cost to come down as we negotiate new, long term energy contracts with suppliers.</p>

<p>And, in the context of a global energy crisis, it is entirely appropriate for the government to use our borrowing powers to fund temporary measures in order to support families and businesses.</p>

<p>That’s what we did during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>A sizeable intervention was right then…and it is right now.</p>

<p>The heavy price of inaction would have been far greater than the cost of these schemes.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of a new era.</p>

<p>As we contemplate this new era, we recognise that there is huge potential in our country.</p>

<p>We have unbounded entrepreneurial drive.</p>

<p>We have highly skilled people.</p>

<p>We have immense global presence in sectors like finance, life sciences, technology, and clean energy.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker, there are too many barriers for enterprise. We need a new approach to break them down. That means reforming the supply side of our economy.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks, my Cabinet colleagues will update the House on every aspect of our ambitious agenda.</p>

<p>Those updates will cover: the planning system, business regulations, childcare, immigration, agricultural productivity, and digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>And Mr Speaker, we start this work today.</p>

<p>An essential foundation of growth is infrastructure.</p>

<p>The roads, railways, and networks that carry people, goods, and information all over our country.</p>

<p>Today, our planning system for major infrastructure is too slow and fragmented.</p>

<p>The time it takes to get consent for nationally significant projects is getting slower, not quicker, while our international competitors forge ahead.</p>

<p>We have to end this.</p>

<p>We can announce that in the coming months, we will bring forward a new Bill to unpick the complex patchwork of planning restrictions and EU-derived laws that constrain our growth.</p>

<p>We will streamline a whole host of assessments, appraisals, consultations, endless duplications, and regulations.</p>

<p>We will also review the government’s business case process to speed up decision making.</p>

<p>And today, we are publishing a list of infrastructure projects that will be prioritised for acceleration, in sectors like transport, energy, and telecoms.</p>

<p>And, to increase housing supply and enable forthcoming planning reforms, we will also increase the disposal of surplus government land to build new homes.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, we are getting out of the way to get Britain building.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>One of the proudest achievements of our government is that unemployment is at the lowest level for nearly fifty years.</p>

<p>But with more vacancies than unemployed people to fill them, we need to encourage people to join the labour market.</p>

<p>We will make work pay by reducing people’s benefits if they don’t fulfil their job search commitments.</p>

<p>We’ll provide extra support for unemployed over-50s.</p>

<p>And we’ll ask around 120,000 more people on Universal Credit to take active steps to seek more and better paid work, or face having their benefits reduced.</p>

<p>And, Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>At such a critical time for our economy, it is simply unacceptable that strike action is disrupting so many lives.</p>

<p>Other European countries have Minimum Service Levels to stop militant trade unions closing down transport networks during strikes.</p>

<p>So we will do the same.</p>

<p>And we will go further.</p>

<p>We will legislate to require unions to put pay offers to a member vote, to ensure strikes can only be called once negotiations have genuinely broken down.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr Speaker, to drive growth, we need new sources of capital investment.</p>

<p>To this end, I can announce that we will accelerate reforms to the pension charge cap so that it will no longer apply to well-designed performance fees.</p>

<p>This will unlock pension fund investment into UK assets and innovative, high growth businesses.</p>

<p>It will benefit savers and increase growth.</p>

<p>And, we will provide up to £500 million to support new innovative funds and attract billions of additional pounds into UK science and technology scale-ups.</p>

<p>And Mr Speaker, this brings me to the cap on bankers’ bonuses.</p>

<p>A strong UK economy has always depended on a strong financial services sector.</p>

<p>We need global banks to create jobs here, invest here, and pay taxes here in London, not Paris, not Frankfurt, not New York.</p>

<p>All the bonus cap did was to push up the basic salaries of bankers, or drive activity outside Europe.</p>

<p>It never capped total remuneration, so let’s not sit here and pretend otherwise.</p>

<p>So we’re going to get rid of it.</p>

<p>And to reaffirm the UK’s status as the world’s financial services centre, I will set out an ambitious package of regulatory reforms later in the Autumn.</p>

<p>But Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>To support growth right across the country, we need to go further, with targeted action in local areas.</p>

<p>So today, I can announce the creation of new investment zones.</p>

<p>We will liberalise planning rules in specified agreed sites, releasing land and accelerating development.</p>

<p>And we will cut taxes.</p>

<p>For businesses in designated tax sites, for ten years, there will be:</p>

<p>Accelerated tax reliefs for structures and buildings.</p>

<p>And 100% tax relief on qualifying investments in plant and machinery.</p>

<p>On purchases of land and buildings for commercial or new residential development, there will be no stamp duty to pay whatsoever.</p>

<p>On newly occupied business premises, there will be no business rates to pay whatsoever.</p>

<p>And if a business hires a new employee in the tax site, then on the first £50,000 they earn…</p>

<p>…the employer will pay no National Insurance whatsoever.</p>

<p>That is an unprecedented set of tax incentives for business to invest, to build, and to create jobs right across the country.</p>

<p>I can confirm for the House that we’re in early discussions with nearly 40 places like Tees Valley, the West Midlands, Norfolk and the West of England to establish Investment Zones.</p>

<p>And we’ll work with the devolved administrations and local partners to make sure Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also benefit, if they are willing to do so.</p>

<p>If we really want to level up, Mr Speaker – we have to unleash the power of the private sector.</p>

<p>And now, Mr Speaker, we come to tax – central to solving the riddle of growth.</p>

<p>The tax system is not simply about raising revenue for public services, vitally important though that is. Tax determines the incentives across our whole economy.</p>

<p>And we believe that high taxes reduce incentives to work, they deter investment and they hinder enterprise.</p>

<p>As the Prime Minister has said, we will review the tax system to make it simpler, more dynamic, and fairer for families.</p>

<p>And we are taking that first step today.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The interests of businesses are not separate from the interest of individuals and families.</p>

<p>In fact, it is businesses that employ most people in this country.</p>

<p>It is businesses that invest in the products and services we rely on.</p>

<p>Every additional tax on business is ultimately passed through to families through higher prices, lower pay, or lower returns on savings.</p>

<p>So I can therefore confirm that next year’s planned increase in Corporation Tax will be cancelled.</p>

<p>The UK’s corporate tax rate will not rise to 25% - it will remain at 19%.</p>

<p>We will have the lowest rate of Corporation Tax in the G20.</p>

<p>This will plough almost £19bn a year back into the economy.</p>

<p>That’s £19bn for businesses to reinvest, create jobs, raise wages, or pay the dividends that support our pensions.</p>

<p>I’ve already taken steps elsewhere in this statement to support financial services, so the Bank Surcharge will remain at 8%.</p>

<p>But, Mr Speaker, we will do more to encourage private investment.</p>

<p>The Annual Investment Allowance, which gives 100% tax relief on investments in plant and machinery, will not fall to £200,000 as planned…</p>

<p>It will remain at £1m.</p>

<p>And it will do so permanently.</p>

<p>Our duty is to make the UK one of the most competitive economies in the world – and we are delivering.</p>

<p>And Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>We want this country to be an entrepreneurial, share-owning democracy.</p>

<p>The Enterprise Investment Scheme. The Venture Capital Trusts. We will extend them beyond 2025.</p>

<p>The Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme. Company Share Option Plans. We will increase the limits to make them more generous.</p>

<p>Crucial steps on the road to making this a nation of entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>For the tax system to favour growth, it needs to be much simpler.</p>

<p>I’m hugely grateful to the Office of Tax Simplification for everything they have achieved since 2010.</p>

<p>But instead of a single arms-length body which is separate from the Treasury and HMRC, we need to embed tax simplification into the heart of Government.</p>

<p>That is why I have decided to wind down the Office of Tax Simplification, and mandated every one of my tax officials to focus on simplifying our tax code.</p>

<p>To achieve a simpler system, I will start by removing unnecessary costs for business.</p>

<p>Firstly, we will automatically sunset EU regulations by December 2023, requiring departments to review, replace or repeal retained EU law.</p>

<p>This will reduce burdens on business, improve growth, and restore the primacy of UK legislation.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, we can also simplify the IR35 rules – and we will.</p>

<p>In practice, reforms to off-payroll working have added unnecessary complexity and cost for many businesses.</p>

<p>So, as promised by My RHF the Prime Minister, we will repeal the 2017 and 2021 reforms.</p>

<p>Of course, we will continue to keep compliance closely under review.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Britain welcomes millions of tourists every year, and I want our high streets and airports, our ports and our shopping centres, to feel the economic benefit.</p>

<p>So we have decided to introduce VAT-free shopping for overseas visitors.</p>

<p>We will replace the old paper-based system with a modern, digital one.</p>

<p>And this will be in place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This is a priority for our great British retailers – so it is our priority, too.</p>

<p>Our drive to modernise also extends to alcohol duties.</p>

<p>I have listened to industry concerns about the ongoing reforms.</p>

<p>I will therefore introduce an 18-month transitional measure for wine duty.</p>

<p>I will also extend draught relief to cover smaller kegs of 20 litres and above, to help smaller breweries.</p>

<p>And, at this difficult time, we are not going to let alcohol duty rates rise in line with RPI.</p>

<p>So I can announce that the planned increases in the duty rates for beer, for cider, for wine, and for spirits will all be cancelled.</p>

<p>Now, Mr Speaker, we come to the question of personal taxation.</p>

<p>It is an important principle that people should keep more of the money they earn.  And it is good policy to boost the incentives for work and enterprise.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we introduced a Bill that means the Health and Social Care Levy will not begin next year… it will be cancelled.</p>

<p>The increase in Employer National Insurance Contributions and dividends tax… will be cancelled.</p>

<p>And the interim increase in the National Insurance rate, brought in for this tax year…will be cancelled.</p>

<p>And this cut will take effect from the earliest possible moment, November 6th.</p>

<p>Reversing the Levy delivers a tax cut for 28 million people, worth, on average, £330 every year;</p>

<p>A tax cut for nearly a million businesses;</p>

<p>And I can confirm: the additional funding for the NHS and social care services will be maintained at the same level.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>I have another measure.</p>

<p>Today’s statement is about growth.</p>

<p>Home ownership is the most common route for people to own an asset, giving them a stake in the success of our economy and society.</p>

<p>So to support growth, increase confidence, and help families aspiring to own their own home, I can announce that we are cutting stamp duty.</p>

<p>In the current system, there is no stamp duty to pay on the first £125,000 of a property’s value.</p>

<p>We are doubling that – to £250,000.</p>

<p>First time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on the first £300,000.</p>

<p>We’re increasing that threshold as well, to £425,000.</p>

<p>And we’re going to increase the value of the property on which first time buyers can claim relief, from £500,000 to £625,000.</p>

<p>The steps we’ve taken today mean 200,000 more people will be taken out of paying stamp duty altogether.</p>

<p>This is a permanent cut to stamp duty, effective from today.</p>

<p>And Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>I have another measure.</p>

<p>High tax rates damage Britain’s competitiveness.</p>

<p>They reduce the incentive to work, invest, and start a business.</p>

<p>And the higher the tax, the more ways people seek to avoid them, or work elsewhere or simply work less…</p>

<p>…rather than putting their time and effort to more creative and productive ends.</p>

<p>Take the additional rate of income tax.</p>

<p>At 45%, it is currently higher than the headline top rate in G7 countries like the US and Italy.</p>

<p>And it is higher even than social democracies like Norway.</p>

<p>But I’m not going to cut the additional rate of tax today, Mr Speaker.</p>

<p>I’m going to abolish it altogether.</p>

<p>From April 2023, we will have a single higher rate of income tax of 40 per cent.</p>

<p>This will simplify the tax system and make Britain more competitive.</p>

<p>It will reward enterprise and work.</p>

<p>It will incentivise growth.</p>

<p>It will benefit the whole economy and whole country.</p>

<p>And, Mr Speaker, after all, this only returns us to the same top rate we had for 20 years.</p>

<p>And that’s not all.</p>

<p>I can announce today that we will cut the basic rate of income tax to 19p in April 2023 – one year early.</p>

<p>That means a tax cut for over 31 million people in just a few months’ time.</p>

<p>This means we will have one of the most competitive and pro-growth income tax systems in the world.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>For too long in this country, we have indulged in a fight over redistribution.</p>

<p>Now, we need to focus on growth, not just how we tax and spend.</p>

<p>We won’t apologise for managing the economy in a way that increases prosperity and living standards.</p>

<p>Our entire focus is on making Britain more globally competitive - not losing out to our competitors abroad.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister promised that this would be a tax-cutting government.</p>

<p>Today, we have cut stamp duty.</p>

<p>We have allowed businesses to keep more of their own money to invest, to innovate, and to grow.</p>

<p>We have cut income tax and national insurance for millions of workers.</p>

<p>And we are securing our place in a fiercely competitive global economy…</p>

<p>…with lower rates of corporation tax…</p>

<p>…and lower rates of personal tax.</p>

<p>We promised to prioritise growth.</p>

<p>We promised a new approach for a new era.</p>

<p>We promised, Mr Speaker, to release the enormous potential of this country.</p>

<p>Our Growth Plan has delivered all those promises and more.</p>

<p>And I commend it to the House.</p>
