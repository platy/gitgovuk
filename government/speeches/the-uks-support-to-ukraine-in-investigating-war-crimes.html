<p>Sexual violence during conflict, as we all know, is a devastating and inhumane act that shatters lives. Not just for one generation, but for repeated generations to come. Yet impunity for these crimes continues to be the norm. We must change that. Not in a year’s time, not in a month, not tomorrow, but today.</p>

<p>In Ukraine, tragically there continues to be mounting evidence of horrific acts of sexual violence, and other crimes, committed by Russian forces.</p>

<p>We are of course working very closely with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, and we heard from her this morning. To ensure that all potential war crimes are fully investigated, and importantly those responsible are held to account.</p>

<p>That is why the United Kingdom has joined with the United States and the European Union to launch the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), which is supporting the Office of the Prosecutor General to investigate and prosecute conflict-related crimes.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister</h3>

<p>I am delighted to announce that today the United Kingdom will commit £2.5 million to delivering justice for war crimes in Ukraine, through the ACA’s vital work.</p>

<p>As a State Party we also are and stand ready to provide further support to the ICC and Prosecutor Karim Kahn in support of what his vital work and role is on the ground in Ukraine, and we work very closely with him on issues of further cooperation and support.</p>

<p>Yet as you said in your introduction Foreign Minister, one of the roles I have been proud to lead over the last five years for the United Kingdom is my role as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict. I have been pleased, and indeed work very closely with SRSG Patten both as a friend and a colleague on this important issue. For each brave Ukrainian survivor of sexual violence who is speaking out, and as we heard from SRSG Patten just now there are many more who fail to come forward.</p>

<p>There are reasons which are valid, victims are silenced by stigma, they are silenced by shame or fear of reprisal. Sometimes, Your Excellencies, that stigma and shame comes from their own. Therefore, we must support them, we must do everything we can in support of our Ukrainian friends and colleagues on the ground, and we must be collectively determined to change this. Ultimately, we must put survivors first.</p>

<p>I call upon every friend and colleague, in this room and beyond, and every organisation here represented to champion the standards set out in the Murad Code.</p>

<p>Since 2019 we have put survivors at the heart of our own approach in the United Kingdom, we have two survivors of sexual violence who directly advise myself and the Government on both our policy and programming. But equally we were proud earlier this year at the United Nations Security Council, working with Nadia Murad the courageous survivor of sexual violence well known to many of us in this room. To launch this global code of conduct which can help to ensure that those gathering information from survivors do this ethically and effectively. It cannot be right, we heard from Karim earlier that he was in the Cox’s Bazaar. When I visited there I met a victim, 27 times this woman had to repeat her testimony, and every time that testimony was given it dilutes the evidence. It makes that prosecution less sustainable. We must, and I implore upon all of you, look at the Murad Code, adopt the Murad Code, make the Murad Code the gold standard by which we collect evidence.</p>

<p>Without over-documenting their experiences or indeed re-traumatising them as well.</p>

<h3>New PSVI policy initiatives</h3>

<p>The unprecedented international response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine demonstrates the impact we have when we stand together, when we work together, when we are inclusive, when we have an iron resolve to deliver.</p>

<p>Working with partners around the world, I assure you the United Kingdom stands ready to spearhead efforts to strengthen the global response to sexual violence in conflict, wherever it occurs.</p>

<p>We must have a vision of practical solutions to end these abhorrent crimes.</p>

<p>Including how to boost the national authorities in Ukraine in their ability for successful prosecutions.</p>

<p>We will strengthen international law by continuing to drive forward the Crimes Against Humanity Convention that is currently being considered at the UN.</p>

<p>And we will agree a new political declaration to strengthen global action on this issue.</p>

<p>I invite you all to our international conference on this very issue,  in November 28-30 in London, which will be a moment to come together on the issue of conflict related sexual violence, to prove that we mean it when we say ‘enough is enough’, we are putting survivors first.</p>

<p>I am confident Foreign Minister that we will put survivors first, if we work together, bring them the justice they deserve - the justice they desire. Finally, to you Prosecutor General Venediktova, Foreign Minister Kuleba, let me say on this and I hope you get this message clearly. Both in terms of not just the words but the actions we deliver on the ground. To the victims I say - you are not alone, we stand with you, we are united with you, we are united with Ukraine, we are united with the people of Ukraine.</p>
