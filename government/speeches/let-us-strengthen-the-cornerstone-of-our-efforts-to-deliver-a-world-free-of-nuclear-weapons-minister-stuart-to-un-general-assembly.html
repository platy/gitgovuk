<p>Thank you Mr President,</p>

<p>Mr Tochytskyi,</p>

<p>We salute you, we salute the Ukrainian people as you stand up against aggression and oppression.</p>

<p>This Tenth Review Conference is long overdue, so I am pleased that we have finally come together to advance this vital work.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom remains firmly committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty.</p>

<p>That includes Article Six, and our ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>This Treaty is the only route to that goal.</p>

<p>Let me reaffirm the UK’s unequivocal undertaking to achieve the total elimination of our nuclear arsenal, alongside the other Nuclear Weapon States.</p>

<p>Our National Report, published last November, outlines what we have done to implement the Treaty since 2015.</p>

<p>It demonstrates that we take our responsibilities as a Nuclear Weapon State seriously, and that we are committed to transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Since the Cold War, the UK has dramatically reduced the number of its nuclear weapons, while de-targeting and de-alerting those that remain.</p>

<p>We are the only Nuclear Weapon State to have decreased our deterrent capability to a single delivery system. Indeed, ours is the smallest stockpile of any recognised nuclear state.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to play a leading role in disarmament by pioneering verification work, championing transparency and advancing risk reduction.</p>

<p>We will carry on pressing for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to enter into force and for negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament.</p>

<p>But as you all know, we have to acknowledge the growing challenges to international security.</p>

<p>Last year, the UK published our Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy.</p>

<p>It described a deteriorating global security environment, increased competition, technological disruption and challenges to the international order.</p>

<p>Since then of course, we have witnessed Russia’s unprovoked and premeditated assault on Ukraine, a sovereign, democratic, non-nuclear weapon state.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom continues to stand with Ukraine.</p>

<p>Russia’s actions and irresponsible rhetoric raise questions about its commitment to international law and the fulfilment of its obligations, not lease those under the Treaty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we are deeply concerned that Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continue to escalate their nuclear programmes despite calls to engage in diplomacy.</p>

<p>Today, we issued a joint Ministerial Statement with France and the US. This reaffirmed our January statement, made, you’ll all remember,&nbsp; with the other nuclear weapon states, on preventing nuclear war. We also repeated our commitment to honour our national security assurances when given.</p>

<p>We will work with all States Parties to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and enhance mutual trust.</p>

<p>Much of the Treaty’s success in curtailing the nuclear arms race is due to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s safeguards regime.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to champion this regime and indeed, the Agency, while working to enhance nuclear security by ratifying key conventions.</p>

<p>We remain committed to nuclear weapon-free zones. We have signed and ratified the Protocols for Latin America and the Caribbean, the South Pacific, Africa, and Central Asia.&nbsp;We stand ready to do so for South East Asia as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As co-sponsor of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East, we remain committed to a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, based on freely-made agreements by all the countries of the region.</p>

<p>The Non-Proliferation Treaty provides the framework for the safe, secure, and safeguarded transfer of peaceful nuclear technologies.</p>

<p>These technologies have the potential to improve lives around the world, particularly in the least developed countries.</p>

<p>This is why the United Kingdom alongside the United States has been consulting with States Parties on improved access to peaceful uses coming out of those technologies.</p>

<p>We would like to see a new Sustained Dialogue, bringing fresh perspectives and identifying new opportunities to support peaceful uses across a number of areas.</p>

<p>At this Review Conference, the UK calls on all States Parties to work towards a meaningful outcome across all three pillars of the Treaty.</p>

<p>Let us be optimistic. Let us celebrate the NPT and renew our support for it. Let us strengthen it as the cornerstone of our efforts to deliver a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>
