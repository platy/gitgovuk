<p>I’m sorry not to be able to be with you live today, I’m actually in east Africa: in a part of the continent that is leading the way to embrace renewable energy.</p>

<p>Yet despite Africa’s abundance of renewable energy sources – solar, wind, hydro and geothermal - most countries, businesses and communities still rely on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Given the need for all countries to transition to clean growth, this presents an era-defining opportunity for the private sector.</p>

<p>The UK Government is working with African countries to support their pursuit of  clean, sustainable, and resilient development.</p>

<p>At COP26, alongside France, Germany, the US and EU, we signed a ground-breaking $8.5 billion deal with South Africa, to support the country’s transition from coal. It is expected to prevent up to 1.5 Gigatonnes of emissions over the next 20 years.</p>

<p>And also at COP, the UK led a group of 12 international donors to collectively pledge at least $1.5 billion to maintain and protect the Congo Basin’s forests and peatlands. We plan to build on this in the coming years, with further finance and investment from a variety of public and private sources.</p>

<p>We have given an additional £126m to the Transforming Energy Access initiative, which aims to leverage more than £1.3bn to provide 25 million people with access to clean energy by 2026.</p>

<p>We are also investing in other strands of Africa’s transition to clean growth.</p>

<p>For example in November, I signed a landmark Green Growth agreement with the Zambian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which aims to attract billions in sustainable investment and boost trade.</p>

<p>And through our revamped development investment company  - British International Investment - we will invest £3 billion into climate finance in Africa and South Asia over the next five years, making it one of the largest climate finance investors in Africa.</p>

<p>British International Investment is helping to support a green revolution, for example by restoring 10,000 hectares of forest in Ghana with the scope to plant up to 25,000 trees a day.</p>

<p>BII is also backing pioneering 3D printing, that will help build low-carbon housing and schools, which will reduce the carbon footprint of new homes in Malawi and Kenya  by up to 70 per cent.</p>

<p>Our funding is an investment in our collective future. And it is a huge opportunity for UK and African businesses.</p>

<p>In 2020, at the UK-Africa Investment Summit, we committed to build a new business support service to expand trade with African countries.</p>

<p>And today I’m proud to say that the service is up and running, and ready to help UK and African businesses connect and identify trade and investment opportunities.</p>

<p>It is called the Growth Gateway - a digital portal that offers support on trade, finance, and investment, backed by a team of trade and investment specialists, including experts from Boston Consulting Group and PA Consulting.</p>

<p>Growth Gateway provides you with all the information you need in one place. With a team of 20 experts, who have worked extensively on trade and investment in Africa, together they have over 190 years of hands-on experience and are available to answer any questions. They are taking part in today’s conference, and I encourage you to ask what they can do to support your business.</p>

<p>Comparatively, African countries have made a tiny contribution to climate change. However, we can only overcome climate change – and only unleash the huge economic potential of African nations - when all governments and businesses work shoulder to shoulder, for the good of us all.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
