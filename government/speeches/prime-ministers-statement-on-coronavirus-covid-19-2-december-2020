<p>It is almost a year since humanity has been tormented by COVID</p>

<p>Across the world, economic output has plummeted and a million and a half people have died</p>

<p>And all the time we have waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy</p>

<p>And give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill – and now the scientists have done it</p>

<p>And they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine from an idea that was pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner in 1796</p>

<p>And today we can announce that the government has accepted the recommendation</p>

<p>from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</p>

<p>to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for distribution across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>after months of clinical trials,</p>

<p>involving thousands of people</p>

<p>to ensure that the vaccine meets the strictest, internationally recognised, standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Thanks to the fantastic work of Kate Bingham and the Vaccines Task Force,</p>

<p>we purchased more than 350 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates,</p>

<p>and the UK was the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this Pfizer vaccine</p>

<p>securing 40 million doses.</p>

<p>Through our Winter Plan, the NHS has been preparing for the biggest programme of mass vaccination in the history of the UK.</p>

<p>And that is going to begin next week,</p>

<p>and in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation</p>

<p>the first phase will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable,</p>

<p>But there are immense logistical challenges:</p>

<p>the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees</p>

<p>and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart.</p>

<p>So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected,</p>

<p>Long and cold months</p>

<p>So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism</p>

<p>Or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over</p>

<p>Its not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan,</p>

<p>a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus, protect the NHS and the vulnerable,</p>

<p>keep education and the economy going</p>

<p>and use treatments, testing and vaccines to enable us to return to much closer to normal by spring.</p>

<p>Today in England we have ended national restrictions, opening up significant parts of the economy in doing so;</p>

<p>but also replacing them with tough tiers to keep this virus down.</p>

<p>And I know that those tiers will mean continued hardship for many, and it is going to continue to be tough for some sectors</p>

<p>but until the vaccine is deployed, our plan does rely on all of us continuing to make sacrifices to protect those we love.</p>

<p>So please, please continue to follow the rules where you live,</p>

<p>remember hands, face, space –</p>

<p>and if you live in a tier 3 area where community testing will be made available, please take part in that community testing.</p>

<p>Together, these steps are for now the surest way to protect yourselves and those you love</p>

<p>and by reducing the transmission of the virus, help de-escalate your area to a lower level of restrictions,</p>

<p>as vaccines and testing, as I say, take an ever larger share of the burden.</p>

<p>And as we do all this,</p>

<p>we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring,</p>

<p>but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed:</p>

<p>and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love</p>

<p>So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage</p>
