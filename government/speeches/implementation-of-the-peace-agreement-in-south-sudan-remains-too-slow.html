<p>Thank you Mr President. Let me thank SRSG Haysom and Ms Saeed for your briefings and for the tireless work of their teams in and on South Sudan.</p>

<p>Let me join colleagues in thanking Vietnam for their leadership of  the 2206 Committee, including this briefing and the recent visit.</p>

<p>I would like to make three key points in response to what we have heard today.</p>

<p>Firstly, as we have heard from our briefers today, implementation of the peace agreement remains too slow.  We recognise the challenges but this lack of progress has real and grave consequences for  the people of South Sudan.  The United Kingdom joins others in calling for South Sudan’s leaders to redouble their efforts in 2022.</p>

<p>The recent progress on Public Financial Management shows what can be achieved when South Sudan works in partnership with the international community.  We now urge the Government to approve the delayed annual budget.</p>

<p>Improving economic transparency and tackling corruption will support South Sudanese livelihoods and will help make the country  more attractive to international investors.</p>

<p>The UK is also pleased that the graduation of the Necessary Unified Forces is imminent.  We do however refute the argument that the arms embargo was responsible for the lengthy delays in graduating the Necessary Unified Forces. The exemptions procedure remains in place to ensure the embargo does not constitute an obstacle to South Sudan’s legitimate security needs.</p>

<p>Noting the briefing by Vietnam, let me underline the importance of unblocking nominations to the Panel of Experts, so that the Committee can fulfil its mandate.</p>

<p>Secondly, Mr President, the human rights situation in South Sudan remains of grave concern.</p>

<p>As we have heard today,  civilians, journalists, and civil society continue to face restrictions on their freedom of speech and association.  Silencing these voices is not the way to deliver peace and stability - nor is it conducive to a pathway towards transparent and inclusive elections.</p>

<p>We are also disturbed at continuing credible reports of Conflict Related Sexual Violence perpetrated in South Sudan.  We hope that South Sudan’s CRSV Action plan for the Armed Forces will urgently move from planning to implementation.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr President, I wish to underline the urgency of improving the response to South Sudan’s severe humanitarian crisis. We have heard today how climate shocks are compounding already high levels of humanitarian need.  I urge South Sudan’s leaders to take immediate action to tackle access issues and address threats to humanitarian workers.</p>

<p>Mr President, allow me to conclude by reiterating our call for South Sudan’s leaders to implement their commitments.  Our sincere hope is that with the support of the international community they will show their people in 2022 that they are serious about delivering progress for all.</p>
