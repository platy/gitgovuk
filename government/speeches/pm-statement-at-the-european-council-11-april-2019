<p>I have just met with Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, where I agreed an extension to the Brexit process to the end of October at the latest.</p>

<p>I continue to believe we need to leave the EU, with a deal, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>And vitally, the EU have agreed that the extension can be terminated when the Withdrawal Agreement has been ratified â€” which was my key request of my fellow leaders.</p>

<p>For example, this means that, if we are able to pass a deal in the first three weeks of May, we will not have to take part in European Elections and will officially leave the EU on Saturday, 1st June.</p>

<p>During the course of the extension, the European Council is clear that the UK will continue to hold full membership rights, as well as its obligations.</p>

<p>As I said in the room tonight, there is only a single tier of EU membership, with no conditionality attached beyond existing treaty obligations.</p>

<p>Let me conclude by saying this.</p>

<p>I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension.</p>

<p>The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade Parliament to approve a deal which would allow the UK to leave in a smooth and orderly way.</p>

<p>But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear.</p>

<p>So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be making a statement to the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Further talks will also take place between the Government and the Opposition to seek a way forward.</p>

<p>I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy or that there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament.</p>

<p>But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the Referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward.</p>

<p>Nothing is more pressing or more vital.</p>
