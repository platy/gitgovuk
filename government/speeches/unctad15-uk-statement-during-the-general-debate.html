<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to speak on behalf of the United Kingdom today.</p>

<p>Let me begin by offering my warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan on her appointment. The UK looks forward to working together on revitalizing and reforming UNCTAD, its mandate and its impact to the world, as per her vision.</p>

<p>The fact that we are meeting virtually is testament to the agility and adaptability that UNCTAD [pronounce UNK-tad] and the international community have shown in response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>We will need all those skills for the difficult task ahead. The task of rebuilding and emerging from this crisis more resilient, more inclusive and more environmentally sustainable.</p>

<p>UNCTAD has an important part to play.</p>

<p>As the leading trade and development organisation, it is well-placed to bring together state, private and charitable sector experts, to explore new routes for successful COVID-19 recovery.</p>

<p>The route we need is one that puts us back on track with the Sustainable Development Goals, and the commitments set out in the Addis Ababa and Paris Agreements.</p>

<p>As we enter the Decade of Action, it is crucial that we focus on reducing vulnerability and dependence, while increasing our climate, disaster, and economic resilience.</p>

<p>This conference is an excellent opportunity to reinforce our commitment to working collectively on these issues, and to making tangible progress towards achieving Agenda 2030.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time the UK is representing itself independently at this conference in nearly 50 years, so I would like to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to supporting developing countries to reduce poverty through trading opportunities.</p>

<p>We are proud to be one of the major aid donors.</p>

<p>Our comprehensive Aid for Trade portfolio continues to support our partners to break down barriers to trade.</p>

<p>The UK is now in a unique position where we can, and will, shape our independent trade and development work to best support our partners.</p>

<p>For example, earlier this year, we launched our own Developing Countries Trading Scheme, which grants duty-free, quota-free access to 46 Least Developed Countries, and special tariff reductions to other developing countries.</p>

<p>We are looking to improve that further, by lowering tariffs and simplifying rules of origin requirements. We aim to be a global leader in trade preferences.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we have eight development-focused free trade agreements with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that put our relationships on a more equitable and mature footing.</p>

<p>In 2020, the UK imported more than Â£30 billion in goods and services from developing and least developed countries with preferential trading arrangements, supporting their growth and poverty reduction.</p>

<p>We are proud to say that our trade agreement with Australia will be the first ever Free Trade Agreement between two advanced economies to include a chapter dedicated to development issues.</p>

<p>We will continue to use our presidency of the G7 and COP26 this year to push for meaningful progress towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious world.</p>

<p>We want to reduce vulnerabilities so that our planet and people can prosper.</p>

<p>UNCTAD 15, alongside COP26 and MC12, is a vital moment for the international community to come together and address climate change, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. Our focus needs to be on reducing economy-wide emissions and supporting developing countries to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>Madam President, the UK views UNCTAD as an important vehicle for monitoring, analysing and progressing the trade and development agenda.</p>

<p>UNCTAD is already delivering brilliant work to support countries to Agenda 2030, through the UK-funded Sustainable Manufacturing and Pollution programme.</p>

<p>That programme helps developing countries reduce environmental pollution associated with industrial process.</p>

<p>We also work together on the Capacity Building Programme, which supports developing and least developed countries to implement the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.</p>

<p>UNCTAD should continue to focus on its comparative advantage as an expert in producing objective, high-quality research and analysis. This work helps target our technical assistance for the best results on the ground.</p>

<p>Within the uncertain funding landscape, it is crucial that UNCTAD focuses available resources on its priority areas and does not overburden itself.</p>

<p>Strong institutional governance, inter-divisional cooperation and focus on consensus-building will be vital to delivering the new mandate over the next four years.</p>

<p>To conclude, the United Kingdom is fully committed to a positive outcome at UNCTAD 15. An outcome based on partnership for a fairer, more prosperous and equal world.</p>

<p>Our focus remains on inclusive, open economies under the rules-based international trading system and a greener, more sustainable future for us all.</p>

<p>I wish Barbados every success for its presidency of UNCTAD 15.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
