<p>It is a privilege to join the WTO’s twelfth Ministerial Conference.</p>

<p>Many thanks must go to the Director General, Dr Ngozi, the General Council Chair, Ambassador Chambovey and the WTO Secretariat, for all their efforts to support this event.</p>

<p>This, the largest gathering of ministers in five years, comes at a pivotal time for the WTO and indeed, the global community.</p>

<p>Putin’s brutal war has unleashed devastation and disruption on a world already burdened with Covid-19 and facing the omnipresent threat of climate change.</p>

<p>At such a critical and fragile time, we must defend the values that bind us together.</p>

<p>Values that mean we embrace trade’s transformative power, uphold the Rules Based International System and turn our backs on division.</p>

<p>Now, as we begin the UK’s first WTO ministerial conference as an independent trading nation, I want to set out the three principles that will guide our trade policy today and shape our vision for tomorrow:</p>

<p>First, we will always adhere to the concepts on which the World Trade Organisation was founded – trade that is open and free and brings prosperity to the world.</p>

<p>For the past 27 years, these concepts have allowed us to find solutions to the biggest questions facing us all.</p>

<p>Today, we must stay committed to these fundamental ideas and use them to address some of the world’s most significant challenges.</p>

<p>Right now, food security is among the pressing.</p>

<p>Putin’s insatiable appetite for power, threatens to leave the world’s poorest famished.</p>

<p>I am glad that the UK-led Joint Statement on Open and Predictable Trade in Agriculture and Food Products, has been endorsed by over 50 other members – each committing to keep markets open and ensuring food is available to all.</p>

<p>At this Ministerial, I want us to work together to develop a more sustainable, efficient and resilient global food system for the long-term.</p>

<p>Climate change is another global challenge. The UK believes trade can help combat this threat, while simultaneously boosting economic growth.</p>

<p>As a green trade pioneer, the UK recently set out plans to go further and faster in this area.</p>

<p>Now, I want to work with my fellow trade ministers to put the WTO at the epicentre of finding solutions to the environmental issues that will define our future.</p>

<p>A significant step forward, would be a positive outcome to our negotiations on fisheries subsidies.</p>

<p>Success here would mean we achieve the first WTO multilateral agreement focused on sustainability.</p>

<p>The second principle that will guide the UK’s actions; is the need to fight for fairness.</p>

<p>The UK wholeheartedly believes in the power of trade to allow countries to expand their economies.</p>

<p>So, we will support countries to increase exports, build stronger supply chains and tackle market distorting practices.</p>

<p>Every nation should shoulder its responsibility because fairness cuts both ways.</p>

<p>We must also support each other in times of need.  Ukraine’s struggle must be our shared struggle.</p>

<p>With our allies, the UK will continue do everything in our power to support Ukraine’s right to exist as a democratic nation, including helping it rebuild in peace.</p>

<p>The day will surely come when ruined buildings are turned into construction sites and weapons are exchanged for laptops as Ukraine’s services sector recovers and flourishes.</p>

<p>The UK therefore welcomes those delegates who want to join us in supporting Ukraine’s trading present and future.</p>

<p>Our third principle is the need to make sure global trade rules truly address people’s and businesses’ modern-day issues.</p>

<p>All of us agree for the need for WTO modernisation. We must use this ministerial to recommit to progress in this area.</p>

<p>In addition, trade rules created in the pre internet age need to move with the times.</p>

<p>One of our key goals will be keep down the costs for online trade by calling for a renewal of the e-Commerce moratorium at this Ministerial.&nbsp; Businesses will never forgive us if we fail at this task.</p>

<p>We must also go further both by accelerating progress on the joint initiative on e-commerce and by taking a reinvigorated approach to services and digital trade through the WTO, just as the UK has done through its Free Trade Agreements.</p>

<p>The pandemic has also demonstrated why we need a substantive trade and health package. Again, this is something, the UK will press for at this Ministerial.</p>

<p>My team and I look forward to many constructive discussions with our fellow delegates over the next days.</p>

<p>There may be some difficult conversations ahead but we should focus on all we share, rather than what sets us apart.</p>

<p>Our agreements reached here, on Lake Geneva’s shores, will ensure that trade better serves our citizens and the world.&nbsp; Let us seize this opportunity with both hands.</p>
