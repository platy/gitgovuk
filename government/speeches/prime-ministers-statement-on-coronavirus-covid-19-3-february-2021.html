          <div class="govspeak">
<p>Good afternoon,</p>

<p>When Captain Sir Tom Moore decided to launch a national campaign in his own back garden</p>

<p>raising more money and achieving more in his one hundredth year than perhaps any Centenarian in our history</p>

<p>he knew instinctively which organisation he wanted to thank and support</p>

<p>it was – and is – the NHS. And he was right.</p>

<p>Because there are many people and groups responsible for the UK’s vaccination programme</p>

<p>and we owe our thanks to our brilliant scientists,</p>

<p>to Kate Bingham and the Vaccine Task Force which has procured over 400 million doses of seven different types of vaccine,</p>

<p>to the manufacturers and the delivery drivers,</p>

<p>the pharmacists, the military medics, countless volunteers,</p>

<p>but to get this life-saving medicine into the arms of the nation at the kind of speed that we’re seeing</p>

<p>we are relying on the doctors, nurses and all the staff of our NHS.</p>

<p>And it is thanks to their effort – the most colossal in the history of our National Health Service -</p>

<p>that we have today passed the milestone of 10 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom,</p>

<p>including almost 90 per cent of those aged 75 and over in England</p>

<p>and every eligible person in a care home.</p>

<p>And with every jab and every day, we have more evidence about the effectiveness of these vaccines.</p>

<p>New research from Oxford University suggests the protection provided by the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine kicks in after three weeks and lasts right the way through to the booster at three months.</p>

<p>And research also shows that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine seems likely to reduce transmission to others.</p>

<p>And even if these vaccines cannot make us invulnerable,</p>

<p>and no vaccine has ever given 100 per cent protection to everybody</p>

<p>the evidence increasingly shows that our vaccines achieve this crucial objective:</p>

<p>to reduce death and serious illness from those major strains of Covid that have been subject to research.</p>

<p>And in the days leading up to our review point in the week of the 15th of February we will be accumulating even more data</p>

<p>helped by NHS Test and Trace –</p>

<p>so that we can begin to chart a way ahead</p>

<p>starting, if the data allow, with the re-opening of schools on March 8th.</p>

<p>And I will be setting out as much as we can about that roadmap forward on February 22nd</p>

<p>And though today there are some signs of hope</p>

<p>the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave -</p>

<p>the level of infection is still alarmingly high.</p>

<p>And I am sorry to say that we have lost another 1,322 lives in the last 24 hours alone</p>

<p>and our hearts again go out to every family that grieves.</p>

<p>And the wards of our NHS are under huge pressure with more than 32,000 Covid patients still in hospital.</p>

<p>And so tonight let’s clap together for Captain Tom at 6pm and let’s clap for the spirit of optimism that he stood for</p>

<p>but let’s also clap for all those he campaigned for</p>

<p>our brilliant NHS staff and care workers</p>

<p>and let’s do everything we can to carry on supporting them.</p>

<p>Because if we stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives,</p>

<p>then in the words of Captain Tom -</p>

<p>tomorrow will be a good day.</p>
