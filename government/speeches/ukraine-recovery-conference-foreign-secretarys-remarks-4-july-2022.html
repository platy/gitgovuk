<p>Thank you very much Prime Minister, thank you very much to President Cassis for hosting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.urc2022.com/" rel="external">conference</a> today.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s recovery from Russia’s war of aggression will be a symbol of the power of freedom and democracy over autocracy. It will show Putin that his attempts to destroy Ukraine have only produced a stronger, more prosperous and more united nation.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is resolute in its support of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and we will remain at Ukraine’s side as it emerges as a strong and thriving democracy.</p>

<p>We have led on support for Ukraine during the war and will continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government’s Reconstruction and Development Plan.</p>

<p>This needs to be a new Marshall Plan for Ukraine and it needs to be driven by Ukraine itself.</p>

<p>We will push for immediate investment and to drive economic growth because it’s absolutely imperative we get the Ukrainian economy going, we need to need able to support&nbsp;returning Ukrainians returning to Ukraine, we need to give people hope about the future, and we need to give them the means to be able to support themselves.</p>

<p>Reconstruction should embed reform, modernisation, technology and transparency.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is very pleased to join the Joint Reconstruction Coordination Group.</p>

<p>It’s our view that it’s vital that that is open to partners right around the world, we need all of the free world supporting this effort. It must be open and comprehensive, and it must involve international organisations as are represented on stage at the moment.</p>

<p>It must involve all of those who have been active in helping Ukraine defend itself and who back Ukraine for the long term through thick and thin, whatever it takes.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom has committed to host next year’s 2023 Ukraine Reconstruction Conference. President Cassis, we have a lot to learn from you, it’s been a fantastic conference so far.</p>

<p>We are also exploring how we engage British business, tech companies and universities in that reconstruction effort, we’re looking at how we can use English and Scots law to ensure investors have the confidence to participate in the reconstruction effort, and we will use the might of the City of London and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development which is based in London to make Ukraine one of the world’s top destinations for investment in 2023.</p>

<p>We think there is a real opportunity for Ukraine to near-shore manufacturing, agribusiness, technology, to be an extremely vibrant economy going forward. As the Prime Minister mentioned the United Kingdom is actively looking at how we legislate to seize assets from those who have contributed to this appalling war, it’s vitally important that we acquire those funds for the reconstruction of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The UK will be championing the recovery of the Kyiv region, in response to President Zelenskyy’s specific request from our Prime Minister for UK leadership. We believe that despite the appalling suffering, despite the terrible war crimes that have taken place, the devastation, and the human cost, that Ukraine will emerge stronger and more successful after this war.</p>

<p>President Zelenskyy you have demonstrated that Ukraine is a bastion of freedom and democracy, and it’s our duty as your friends and allies, as the free world, to do whatever it takes to support you.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
