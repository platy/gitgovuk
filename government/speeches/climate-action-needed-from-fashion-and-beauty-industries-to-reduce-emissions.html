<p>When most of us look at pictures from the past, it is style, more than anything else, that identifies the era.</p>

<p>Whether it is frock coats, or  flapper dresses, or pink punk hair.</p>

<p>The fashion and beauty industries absolutely define each age.</p>

<p>And today, we need your help to define this one, as the age when the world gets a grip of the climate crisis.</p>

<p>The situation is absolutely critical.</p>

<p>The world has dithered and delayed for far too long.</p>

<p>We are heading for temperature rises of three degrees, with a real risk of higher warming.</p>

<p>The science is very clear, that would mean catastrophe:</p>

<p>Crop failures. More than a million species pushed into extinction. And entire countries lost to the seas.</p>

<p>We simply must change course.</p>

<p>And we know what we are aiming for.</p>

<p>When the countries of the world signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, they committed to limit global temperature rises to two degrees.</p>

<p>And aim to a rise of only 1.5 degrees.</p>

<p>And that it is to avoid the worst effects of climate change.</p>

<p>But because of those years of delay, to keep the 1.5 degree target within reach, we must now halve global emissions over the next ten years.</p>

<p>Of course, this requires action from governments.</p>

<p>And as President of the next UN climate conference, COP26, I am pushing our world leaders to respond with the urgency the crisis demands.</p>

<p>But governments alone cannot sufficiently reduce emissions.</p>

<p>That requires action across the real economy.</p>

<p>We need business, we need investors driving companies, sectors, and the entire global economy towards its clean, green future.</p>

<p>And action from the fashion and beauty industries is a really vital ingredient as well.</p>

<p>Let’s take the fashion industry.</p>

<p>According to Global Fashion Agenda and Mckinsey, worldwide, the industry produced over 2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018.</p>

<p>That is 4 percent of total global emissions.</p>

<p>That’s well over the annual emissions of France, Germany and the UK, combined. Put together.</p>

<p>And, demand is on course to grow.</p>

<p>Globally, clothing and footwear consumption is set to rise by 63 percent over the next ten years.</p>

<p>So, I want to be frank: with today’s ways of working, the planet simply cannot take it.</p>

<p>I want to be clear with you friends, this is not a dig at the industry in itself.</p>

<p>As the owner of multiple identical white shirts, I cannot pretend to be a fashion follower.</p>

<p>But I am a strong supporter of business. A very strong supporter.</p>

<p>I was the Business Secretary in the UK government over the past year and, as a team, the UK government worked hard to support businesses through the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>We supported lives and livelihoods.</p>

<p>I certainly don’t want to curtail your industries. But I do want to see them move to even more sustainable ways of working.</p>

<p>And that, ultimately, is better for your bottom line.</p>

<p>I know that this is a growing movement within the sector, which is great news.</p>

<p>From brands built on more sustainable ways of working.</p>

<p>To innovations to reduce waste and increase the lifetime of garments:</p>

<p>Now, whether that is fashion rental companies and repair services.</p>

<p>Or big brands like Cos selling second hand pieces.</p>

<p>By the way it is a favorite brand of both my daughters’, as well.</p>

<p>All this is fantastic. But, for the sector as a whole, there is much further to go.</p>

<p>Because, on the fashion industry’s own current trajectory, by 2030, its emissions will be almost double the level required to keep the 1.5 degree target within reach.</p>

<p>The sector would miss the 1.5 degree pathway by 50 percent.</p>

<p>So, we need a fundamental shift.</p>

<p>Sustainability cannot be the preserve of certain brands or discreet collections.</p>

<p>Nods to climate action are absolutely not enough.</p>

<p>We need the whole sector to embrace the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>And to build clean ways of working into the heart of the fashion and beauty industries.</p>

<p>What does this mean in practice?</p>

<p>Most importantly, it means companies and investors joining the Race to Zero campaign.</p>

<p>This is a United Nations campaign that commits you to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.</p>

<p>And, crucially, it requires short-term targets, based on science to take you there.</p>

<p>So that net zero is not just some vague aspiration but a concrete plan.</p>

<p>This is vital to the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>To keep the 1.5 degree target within reach, we need to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century.</p>

<p>So it is fantastic that well over 2000 companies have already signed up to Race to Zero.</p>

<p>Including the likes of L’Oreal, Chanel, Artistic Milliners, Unilever, Natura and Co, Stella McCartney, and Ralph Lauren.</p>

<p>You can join through initiatives like the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action.</p>

<p>This is the principal route for the fashion industry to join.</p>

<p>Other businesses can sign-up through the “Business for 1.5 degrees” initiative as well.</p>

<p>And investors and financial institutions can join through the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero.</p>

<p>The UK’s COP2 presidency will celebrate new recruits on social media.</p>

<p>And I urge all companies and investors that have not yet signed up to absolutely do so.</p>

<p>And if you are already on board, lobby others to join you, including through your trade associations.</p>

<p>Signing-up is not only good for the planet.</p>

<p>It is actually very good for business too.</p>

<p>Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environment.</p>

<p>More and more companies are joining the Race to Zero campaign.</p>

<p>The transition to clean ways of working is, unfortunately,  moving too slowly, but it is going in the right direction.</p>

<p>And when a critical mass of firms have changed how they work, entire industries will shift.</p>

<p>The default will change, and sustainable ways of working will rapidly become the norm.</p>

<p>And if individual companies do not take action now, they risk being left behind.</p>

<p>Trying to catch up with your competitors sailing ahead, into the clean, green future.</p>

<p>So, please, act now.</p>

<p>Sign up to the Race to Zero campaign.</p>

<p>Move your business towards 100 percent clean energy through the RE100 campaign.</p>

<p>Play your part in pushing fashion towards greater circularity.</p>

<p>UK firms can sign up to the new Textiles 2030 initiative, for example.</p>

<p>And, finally, please clean up your supply chains.</p>

<p>This is vital in both fashion and beauty.</p>

<p>Common cosmetics ingredients like palm oil, can drive deforestation.</p>

<p>While McKinsey and Global Fashion Agenda estimate that 70 percent of fashion’s emissions come from supply chain activities like material production.</p>

<p>So please, work with your suppliers to reduce impacts.</p>

<p>Commit to eliminate deforestation from your supply chains.</p>

<p>And use your purchasing power to drive change across the whole of the global economy.</p>

<p>In short, do what you do. And define this age.</p>

<p>Help to make this the era we get on track to make the goals of the Paris Agreement a reality.</p>

<p>Fashion and beauty have shaped the world.</p>

<p>Now you need to help save it.</p>

<p>And I am counting on you. Indeed, the world is counting on you. Let’s make this happen, together.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
