<h2>Red list review</h2>

<p>The government has conducted a further review of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">red list</a> under our new and simplified system of international travel.</p>

<p>Following this review, it continues to be the case that no countries and territories are on the red list. We will keep the red list in place as a precautionary measure to protect public health, and we are prepared to add countries and territories if needed as the UK’s first line of defence if the situation changes.</p>

<h2>Expansion of the inbound vaccination policy</h2>
<p>From 4am on Monday 22 November, the government will recognise vaccines on the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> EUL) at the border. As a result, Sinovac, Sinopharm Beijing and Covaxin will be added to our existing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination#approved-vaccines">list of approved vaccines</a> for inbound travel, benefitting more fully vaccinated passengers.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> Emergency Use Listing process includes a review of quality, safety and efficacy data performed by <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> experts, and many countries such as the United States, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Iceland are already recognising the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> Emergency Use Listings vaccines.</p>

<p>Alongside expanding the list of approved vaccines for inbound travel, we will also expand our inbound vaccination policy to include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination#proof-of-vaccination">proof of vaccine</a> certification from the following 15 countries and territories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Belarus</li>
  <li>Bolivia</li>
  <li>Democratic Republic of the Congo</li>
  <li>Dominican Republic</li>
  <li>Ecuador</li>
  <li>Faroe Islands</li>
  <li>Laos</li>
  <li>Libya</li>
  <li>Malawi</li>
  <li>Mozambique</li>
  <li>Samoa</li>
  <li>Senegal</li>
  <li>Vanuatu</li>
  <li>Zambia</li>
  <li>Zimbabwe</li>
</ul>

<p>Our inbound vaccination policy now covers over <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination#countries-with-an-approved-proof-of-vaccination-and-examples-of-proof-required">150 countries and territories</a>.</p>

<p>From 4am on Monday 22 November, the government will also be simplifying travel rules for all<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#travelling-with-children" class="govuk-link"> under-18s coming to England from a non-red list country or territory</a>, who will be treated as fully vaccinated at the border, regardless of their individual vaccination status. This means they will be exempt from self-isolation requirements on arrival and will only be required to take a lateral flow test post-arrival, with a free confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they test positive.</p>

<h2>Inbound vaccination policy: <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> residency requirements and state certification solutions</h2>
<p>From 4am on Monday 22 November, the government will remove the requirement for people to provide proof of <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> residency when proving their fully vaccinated status with a <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Centers for Disease Control (<abbr title="Centers for Disease Control">CDC</abbr>) card. We will accept the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> <abbr title="Centers for Disease Control">CDC</abbr> card or one of the below <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> state-issued certification solutions as proof of full vaccination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>California Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</li>
  <li>New York State Excelsior Pass Plus</li>
  <li>Washington State WA Verify</li>
</ul>

<p>We will consider additional <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> state-led certification solutions in the future.</p>

<h2>Booster vaccinations in the NHS COVID Pass</h2>
<p>Finally, travellers who have had a booster or a third dose will be able to demonstrate their vaccine status through the NHS COVID Pass from today. This addition will enable those who have had their booster or third dose to travel to countries such as Israel, Croatia and Austria who have already introduced a time limit for the COVID-19 vaccine to be valid for quarantine-free travel.</p>

<p>Whilst public health is a devolved matter, the government works closely with the devolved administrations on any changes to international travel and aims to ensure a whole UK approach.</p>
