<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The UK’s economic recovery has been quicker and stronger than forecast.</p>

<p>In the depths of the pandemic, our economy was expected to return to its pre-crisis level at the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Instead, it got there in November 2021 – a full year earlier.</p>

<p>Unemployment was expected to peak at nearly 12%.</p>

<p>Instead, it peaked at 5.2% and has now fallen to just over 4% - saving more than 2 million jobs.</p>

<p>And with the fastest growing economy in the G7 this year…</p>

<p>Over 400,000 more people on payrolls than before the pandemic…</p>

<p>And business investment rising…it’s no wonder Mr Speaker, that borrowing is set to fall from £320bn last year…</p>

<p>…the highest ever peacetime level…</p>

<p>…to £46bn by the end of this Parliament.</p>

<p>As we emerge from the depths of the worst recession in 300 years, we should be proud of our economic record.</p>

<p>The economy is stronger because of the plan we put in place; because of the actions we took to protect families and businesses.</p>

<p>And that plan is working.</p>

<p>But for all the progress we are making – the job is not yet done.</p>

<p>Right now, I know the number one issue on people’s minds is the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>It is the independent Bank of England’s role to deliver low and stable inflation – and the Governor will set out their latest judgements at midday today.</p>

<p>And just as the government stood behind the British people through the pandemic…</p>

<p>…so we will help people deal with one of the biggest costs they now face – energy.</p>

<p>The energy regulator, OFGEM, announced this morning that the energy price cap will rise in April to £1,971 – an increase of £693 for the average household.</p>

<p>Without government action, this would be incredibly tough for millions of hardworking families.</p>

<p>So the government is going to step in to directly help people manage those extra costs.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Before I set out the steps we are taking, let me explain what’s happening to energy prices, and why.</p>

<p>People’s energy bills are rising because it is more expensive for the companies who supply our energy to buy oil, coal, and gas.</p>

<p>Of the £693 increase in the April price cap, around 80% comes from wholesale energy prices.</p>

<p>Over the last year, the price of gas alone has quadrupled.</p>

<p>And because over 85% of homes in Britain are heated with a gas boiler, and around 40% of our electricity comes from gas, this is hitting households hard.</p>

<p>The reasons gas prices are soaring are global.</p>

<p>Across Europe and Asia, a long, cold winter last year depleted gas stores.</p>

<p>Disruption to other energy sources like nuclear and wind left us relying more than usual on gas during the summer months.</p>

<p>Surging demand in the world’s manufacturing centres in Asia…</p>

<p>…at the same time as countries like China are moving away from coal…</p>

<p>…is further increasing demand for gas.</p>

<p>And concerns about a possible Russian incursion into Ukraine are putting further pressure on wholesale gas markets.</p>

<p>And so prices are rising.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>The price cap has meant that the impact of soaring gas prices has so far fallen mainly on energy companies.</p>

<p>So much so, that some suppliers who couldn’t afford to meet those extra costs have gone out of business as a result.</p>

<p>It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy artificially low.</p>

<p>For me to stand here and pretend we don’t have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest.</p>

<p>But what we can do is take the sting out of a significant price shock for millions of families…</p>

<p>…by making sure the increase in prices is smaller initially and spread over a longer period.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Without government intervention, the increase in the price cap would leave the average household having to find an extra £693.</p>

<p>The actions I’m announcing today will provide, to the vast majority of households, just over half that amount - £350.</p>

<p>In total, the government is going to help around 28 million households this year.</p>

<p>Taken together, this is a plan to help with the cost of living worth around £9bn.</p>

<p>We’re delivering that support in three different ways.</p>

<p>First, we will spread the worst of the extra costs of this year’s energy price shock over time.</p>

<p>This year, all domestic electricity customers will receive an upfront discount on their bills worth £200.</p>

<p>Energy suppliers will apply the discount on people’s bills from October.</p>

<p>With the government meeting the cost in full.</p>

<p>That discount will be automatically repaid from people’s bills in equal £40 instalments over the next five years.</p>

<p>This is the right way to support people while staying on track with our plans to repair the public finances.</p>

<p>And because we are taking a fiscally responsible approach, we can also provide more help, faster, to those who need it most – the second part of our plan.</p>

<p>We’re going to give people a £150 Council Tax rebate to help with the cost of energy, in April – and this discount won’t need to be repaid.</p>

<p>And I do want to be clear with the House that we are deliberately not just giving support to people on benefits.</p>

<p>Lots of people on middle incomes are struggling right now, too - so I’ve decided to provide the council tax rebate to households in Bands A to D.</p>

<p>This means around 80% of all homes in England will benefit.</p>

<p>And the third part of our plan will provide local authorities with a discretionary fund of nearly £150m…</p>

<p>…to help those lower income households who happen to live in higher Council Tax properties…</p>

<p>…and households in bands A-D who are exempt from Council Tax.</p>

<p>We’re also confirming today that we’ll go ahead with existing plans to expand eligibility for the Warm Home Discount by almost a third…</p>

<p>…so that 3m vulnerable households will now benefit from that scheme.</p>

<p>And that’s not all we’re doing to help vulnerable households.</p>

<p>We’re providing £3bn over this Parliament to help more than half a million lower income homes become more energy efficient, saving them on average £290 per year.</p>

<p>Increasing the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour in April, a pay rise of over £1,000 for 2 million low paid workers.</p>

<p>And providing an effective tax cut for those on Universal Credit, allowing almost 2 million households to keep an average of £1,000 per year.</p>

<p>The payment through energy suppliers will apply across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p>Energy policy is devolved in Northern Ireland, with a different regulator, and the government does not have the legal powers to intervene.</p>

<p>So we will make sure the Executive is funded to do something similar, with around £150m for Northern Ireland through the Barnett formula next year.</p>

<p>And because the Council Tax system is England only, total Barnett consequentials of around £565m will be provided to the devolved administrations in the usual way.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>I know that some in this House have argued for a VAT cut on energy.</p>

<p>However, that policy would disproportionately benefit wealthier households.</p>

<p>There would also be no guarantee that suppliers would pass on the discounts to all customers.</p>

<p>And we should be honest with ourselves: this would become a permanent Government subsidy on everyone’s bills.</p>

<p>A permanent subsidy worth £2.5 billion every year – at a time when we are trying to rebuild the public finances.</p>

<p>Instead, our plan allows us to provide more generous support, faster, to those who need it most, providing 28m households with at least £200, and the vast majority receiving £350.</p>

<p>It is fair, it is targeted, it is proportionate - it is the right way to help people with the spike in energy costs.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker,</p>

<p>Today’s announcements are just one part of the government’s plan to tackle this country’s most pressing economic challenges.</p>

<p>A plan for growth – with record investments in infrastructure, innovation and skills.</p>

<p>A plan to restore the public finances – with debt falling by the end of this Parliament.</p>

<p>A plan to cut waiting lists and back the NHS with £29bn over three years and a permanent new source of funding.<br>
And, with the measures I’ve announced today – a plan to help with the rising cost of energy with £350 more in the pockets of tens of millions of hard working families.</p>

<p>That’s our plan to build a stronger economy – not just today but for the long term.</p>

<p>And I commend it to this House.</p>
