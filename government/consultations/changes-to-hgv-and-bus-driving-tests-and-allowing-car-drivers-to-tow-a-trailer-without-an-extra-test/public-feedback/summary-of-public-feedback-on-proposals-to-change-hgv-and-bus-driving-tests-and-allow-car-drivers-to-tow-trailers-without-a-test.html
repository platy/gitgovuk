<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Due to current shortage of delivery drivers this would open up fixed term opportunities for the short term unemployed.  Provide an opening for the long term unemployed, as it is expensive to train and honestly right now most working class families like mine are struggling to meet the weekly bills and seeking opportunities in new areas of work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Would save time and money, a fast and easy solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am currently trying to gain my Cat C licence with a view to doing C+E as soon as possible. Removing the staging requirements would mean that I could enter the profession where drivers are most needed sooner.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Each of these vehicle categories takes a completely different set of skills to operate. If you remove the staging requirements you’re going to end up with a lot of crashes, deaths and incidents from drivers who cannot operate their vehicle properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This will make a huge difference to driver availability, it will take a while to trickle through the industry but will be effective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">There should still be a system of driver and vehicle familiarisation when a newly acquired CE licenced driver is asked to drive Cat C. The rigid vehicle responds different to turning circles without the fifth wheel and manoeuvring and reversing is not easy just because it is smaller than a CE.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Question 6: To what extent do you agree or disagree that a driver who successfully passes a category C+E or D+E test should also be granted entitlement to drive a vehicle in categories C1, C1+E and C or D1, D1+E and D respectively?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This would allow more driving tests to be completed and many yards already have in place this facility</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Manoeuvring is the time when most accidents happen. It is important that this is independently tested to ensure safety, particularly of pedestrians and cyclists, and other vulnerable road users.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This would make the test confusing and muddled. It could potentially extend the period of time to simply train for LGV.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Most trainers are fantastic in their job with plenty of experience in the field</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s no different to taking something like the CBT for motorcycles. This would reduce the test time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">If this helps to relieve the pressure of the testing stations (as and when needed) it should be considered
$CTA</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">​​Makes sense if it allows more <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> driving tests</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Obviously there would be a limit similar to now but it would improve the camping and Caravanning industry therefore promoting British business.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This is a safety issue and was introduced to prevent accidents. This would be a step backwards</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Anyone wishing to tow a trailer should have training similar to the CBT that motorbike riders have to take.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This would allow me to support my volunteering groups, my work place and personal activities without having to take significant time off work</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The test is currently prohibitively expensive and difficult to obtain a slot. Older people have been towing without any training for years. It is ridiculous and unfair</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is vital for training in towing trailers. If <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> are to abolish testing then compulsory training by an approved instructor must be adopted</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Car drivers never used to have to do this and there was never any problems</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As long as you have held a licence for over 3 years</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">No need for a test. But signed off by regulated body</p>
