<p>1. Her Majesty’s Government (<abbr title="Her Majesty’s Government">HMG</abbr>), the Office for the Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), National Grid Plc, and the Electricity System Operator (<abbr title="National Grid Electricity System Operator">NGESO</abbr>) share the vision for a new, independent Future System Operator (<abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr>), that will play a vital role in meeting the challenges and ambitions of the energy system now and in the future.</p>

<p>2. We are committed to working together to create the <abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr> as an expert, impartial body with responsibilities across both the electricity and gas systems, to drive progress towards net zero while maintaining energy security and minimising costs for consumers. <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Government">HMG</abbr>, Ofgem, National Grid Plc and <abbr title="National Grid Electricity System Operator">NGESO</abbr> will each have a key role in ensuring that this vision is realised as swiftly and successfully as possible, noting that this will be subject to legislation when parliamentary time allows.</p>

<p>3. The creation of the <abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr> will require a transaction between <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Government">HMG</abbr> and National Grid Plc (and any other relevant parties), with the parties being appropriately compensated for the elements of their businesses that are transferred into the <abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr>.</p>

<p>4. The current success of <abbr title="National Grid Electricity System Operator">NGESO</abbr>, and the future success of the <abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr>, are fully dependent on the skills, talent and expertise of its staff. It is therefore paramount that we ensure that there is good communication and engagement with affected employees as we plan the next steps. We will also prioritise avoiding any disruption to current energy system operation activities and ensure that momentum towards a net zero energy system is maintained.</p>

<p>5. We recognise the multiple demands on industry, especially at present, and plan to engage industry participants at the appropriate points, to support a smooth transition to the <abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr>.</p>

<p>6. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, Ofgem, National Grid and <abbr title="National Grid Electricity System Operator">NGESO</abbr> will now work closely together to plan, prepare for and implement the changes that are needed to create the <abbr title="Future System Operator">FSO</abbr> that the energy system requires.</p>
