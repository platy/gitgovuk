<p>Senior Traffic Commissioner’s Statutory Documents: consultation on amendments arising from The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>STC Foreword</h2>

<p>The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022
implements aspects of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukeu-and-eaec-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-ts-no82021">UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement</a> (TCA) relevant to the operator licensing system in Great Britain. Most notable is the requirement for vehicles over 2.5 tonnes operating for hire and reward on an international basis to require an operator’s licence.</p>

<p>As Senior Traffic Commissioner, I have powers to issue Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain (the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/senior-traffic-commissioners-statutory-guidance-and-statutory-directions">Statutory Documents</a>).</p>

<p>Publishing documents to explain how we work allows traffic commissioners to deliver consistent and fair regulation of the transport industry and represents our efforts to modernise the licensing regime.</p>

<p>Few regulators are able to demonstrate the same level of transparency in their decision-making.</p>

<p>In this consultation I am seeking your views on the amendments I propose to make to the Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions to reflect the changes to the legislation.</p>

<p>As these changes are required as a result of changing legislation and are limited in scope, we have agreed with the Department for Transport for a four-week consultation period.</p>

<p>We invite you to offer you thoughts and contributions on the draft approach we are considering.</p>

<p>Richard Turfitt<br>
Senior Traffic Commissioner for Great Britain</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Role of the Traffic Commissioners</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/traffic-commissioners">Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain</a> are independent specialist regulators. They are responsible for the licensing and regulation of commercial vehicle operators and regulating the conduct of professional drivers in the lorry, bus and coach industries.</p>

<p>As part of their key <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-commissioners-strategic-objectives-for-2021-to-2023">strategic objectives</a>, the commissioners aim to promote a safe road transport industry which supports compliance, fair competition and protects the environment.</p>

<p>The Senior Traffic Commissioner’s Statutory Documents describe how traffic commissioners may approach applying the law and a proportionate approach to the exercise of their regulatory powers. They provide useful reference to operators, transport managers and drivers and those that represent them.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022</h3>

<p>The legislation governing the goods vehicle operator licensing system is being amended as part of the UK’s obligations under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukeu-and-eaec-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-ts-no82021">UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement</a>.  Making these changes ensures consistency with the TCA requirements, and continued commercial access to EU markets for UK goods road transport operators. EU operators will be subject to the requirements in the TCA in the UK.</p>

<p>The explanatory memorandum to the draft statutory instrument sets out the purpose of the amendments as follows:</p>

<p>“The principal change that this instrument introduces is the extension of the goods vehicle operator licensing regimes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to include light goods vehicles (LGVs), such as vans or pick-up trucks, which weigh more than 2.5 tonnes and up to 3.5 tonnes in maximum laden weight (either alone, or combined weight when used with a trailer) and which operate internationally, for hire or reward.”</p>

<p>The amending statutory instruments have been laid in draft and are undergoing Parliamentary processes. The drafts can be accessed at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348230987" rel="external">The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-withdrawal-act-2018-statutory-instruments/the-goods-vehicles-licensing-of-operators-amendment-no-2-regulations-2022">The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2022</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>The Statutory Documents</h3>

<p>The Statutory Documents comprise of Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions.</p>

<p>The Statutory Guidance provides information as to the way in which the Senior Traffic Commissioner believes that traffic commissioners should interpret the law relating to the application of the Statutory Documents.</p>

<p>The Statutory Directions are addressed to the traffic commissioners in respect of the approach to be taken by staff acting on behalf of individual traffic commissioners and dictate the operation of delegated functions.</p>

<p>The Senior Traffic Commissioner has updated the Statutory Documents to reflect the proposed amendments to the legislation. As the operators of light goods vehicles affected by the proposed changes will be required to hold an operator’s licence by 22 May 2022, the Senior Traffic Commissioner has considered it appropriate to amend the Statutory Documents based on the draft legislation, rather than await the legislation coming into force. This approach seeks to assist potential applicants in the intervening period. The draft legislation may be amended as it is considered by Parliament, and any changes as a result of the Parliamentary process will be reflected in the Statutory Documents before they are finalised.</p>

<p>In drafting the Statutory Documents, the Senior Traffic Commissioner has sought to apply the legislation and adopt an approach consistent with that taken in other traffic commissioner functions where these are supported by existing case law.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Revisions to the Statutory Documents</h3>

<p>The amendments to the Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the traffic commissioners should approach the licensing of light goods vehicles, in particular how the legislation differs between heavy goods vehicles and light goods vehicles;</li>
  <li>inclusion of financial standing rates for operators of light goods vehicles;</li>
  <li>requirements for stable and effective establishment and the disapplication of operating centre requirements for light goods vehicles;</li>
  <li>provisions on the recognition of holders of acquired rights for light goods vehicles to fulfil the professional competence requirement;</li>
  <li>the approach for traffic commissioner when considering appeals against the refusal of the Secretary of State to grant acquired rights for light goods vehicles;</li>
  <li>general update to the requirements for all transport managers, in particular the requirement for transport managers to be resident in the United Kingdom and the introduction of a minimum disqualification period where a transport manager has been found not to be of good repute;</li>
  <li>increased scope of Statutory Document 0 to include light goods vehicles and provide an introduction to operator licensing, the statutory guidance and statutory directions.</li>
</ul>
