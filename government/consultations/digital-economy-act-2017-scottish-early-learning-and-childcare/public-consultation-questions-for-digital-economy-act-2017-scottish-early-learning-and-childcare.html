<p>As part of the consultation process, we are seeking views from organisations and individuals on the proposed public service delivery objective to enable data sharing to improve take-up of early learning and childcare (ELC) in Scotland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Background</h2>
<p>The Central, Digital and Data Office within the Cabinet Office has policy responsibility for data sharing undertaken using the Digital Economy Act 2017 and for introducing objectives to improve public service delivery set out in part 5, chapter 1 of the Digital Economy Act 2017.</p>

<p>The public service delivery power enables new objectives to be set in regulations. A proposed objective must meet three conditions to be able to use the Digital Economy Act 2017 to facilitate their data shares. The three conditions are as follows:</p>

<p>(9) The first condition has as its purpose -</p>

<ol>
  <li>the improvement or targeting of a public service provided to individuals or households, or</li>
  <li>the facilitation of the provision of a benefit (whether or not financial) to individuals or households</li>
</ol>

<p>(10) The second condition is that the objective has as its purpose the improvement of the well-being of individuals and households</p>

<p>(12) The third condition is that the objective has as its purpose the supporting of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the delivery of a specified person’s functions, or</li>
  <li>the administration, monitoring or enforcement of a specified person’s functions</li>
</ol>

<p>Further information can be found in the consultation publication. We would like to consult widely on the objective proposal and would encourage you to respond to our key consultation questions. However, it is not mandatory to use the questions below, we welcome all responses and opinions you may contribute.</p>

<p>Only a small number of specified Cabinet Office (CO) and Scottish Government analysts and members of the Data Sharing Legislation team will have access to the individual level data collected in the survey. Collective responses will be analysed and we will publish a government response. Your responses may be published in a summary of the consultation, but only if you opt-in to this.</p>

<p>Finally, we would like to thank you in advance for your support of this important work. Please be as open and frank as you wish. We need your help to get this right.</p>
