<h1>Government response to the consultation on data sharing to support early learning and childcare in Scotland</h1>

<p>This consultation response was published in June 2022<br>
It is also available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/early-learning-and-childcare-elc-expansion-monthly-updates/" rel="external">https://www.gov.scot/publications/early-learning-and-childcare-elc-expansion-monthly-updates</a></p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>In January 2022, the UK Government, in partnership with the Scottish Government consulted on draft regulations to enable data sharing to target funded early learning and childcare for certain 2 year olds in Scotland.</p>

<p>The consultation set out draft Regulations to allow data sharing between HMRC, DWP, the Scottish Government and Scottish local authorities in order to help identify and contact households that have a 2 year old eligible for funded early learning and childcare (ELC). The regulations would create an objective to share relevant data for this purpose under relevant powers in the Digital Economy Act 2017.</p>

<p>We received 69 responses during the 8 week consultation period. The Government wishes to thank all those who took the time and effort to respond to the consultation, and for the contributions received.</p>

<p>Responses were decidedly positive. A clear majority of respondents agreed that the proposed data share would improve and target a service to eligible households (94%) and thereby improve their wellbeing (88%). Respondents also agreed (86%) that the data sharing would deliver tangible benefits to households, including early stage support to promote education, health and social equalities.</p>

<p>Importantly, the majority of respondents agreed (87%) that the personal data items to be shared - specifically including the customer (parent or carer) name, address and National Insurance number (for unique identification), as well as a child(ren) indicator to confirm the existence of a child, or children, is consistent with ELC service delivery.</p>

<p>Respondents also commented on the criteria for the early learning and childcare scheme in Scotland and the Scottish Government’s response to those comments is included in this government response.</p>

<p>Both the UK and Scottish Governments are reassured that the responses are broadly positive and welcome the helpful input from respondents. As the Scottish Parliament can only approve proposals for new objectives which solely involve specified Scottish bodies permitted to make use of the public service delivery power, and the proposed objective would involve disclosure and processing of data held by UK departments (HMRC and DWP), the draft regulations must be taken through the UK Parliament by the UK Government. The UK Government will take forward legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

<h2>The Digital Economy Act 2017</h2>

<p>The consultation paper, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/digital-economy-act-2017-scottish-early-learning-and-childcare/data-sharing-to-support-early-learning-and-childcare-in-scotland">data sharing to support early learning and childcare in Scotland</a> was published on 10 January 2022. The consultation ran until 07 March 2022, inviting comments on the proposed objective seeking to create a legal gateway to share data using the public service delivery power under Part 5, Chapter 1 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/contents/enacted" rel="external">Digital Economy Act 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Data sharing objectives can be created providing they meet the criteria in Section 35 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/contents/enacted" rel="external">Digital Economy Act 2017</a> and secure Parliamentary approval. The criteria set under Section 35 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>condition 1: the purpose is the improvement or targeting of a public service provided to individuals or households, or the facilitation of the provision of a benefit (whether or not financial) to individuals or households</li>
  <li>condition 2: the purpose is the improvement of the well-being of individuals or households</li>
  <li>condition 3: the purpose is the supporting of the delivery of a specified person’s functions, or the administration, monitoring or enforcement of a specified person’s functions</li>
</ul>

<p>The consultation set out a proposed objective for data sharing to support early learning and childcare (ELC) in Scotland and the draft Digital Government (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2022 which would enact it.</p>

<p>The Scottish Government published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/expansion-early-learning-childcare-reinstatement-1140-statutory-duty-equalities-impact-assessment-eqia/" rel="external">Equality Impact Assessment</a> in January 2021 on the policy framework for ELC in Scotland. The impact assessment did not identify any direct or indirect unlawful discrimination. No comments were received on the impact assessment and therefore it has not been revised.</p>

<h2>The proposed objective</h2>

<p>The UK Government, in partnership with the Scottish Government, is proposing to create a new public service delivery objective under Part 5, Chapter 1 of the Digital Economy Act 2017. The proposed objective will allow HMRC and DWP to share data with the Scottish Government and then onwards to the Scottish Local Authorities, for the specified purpose of identifying children and families who may be eligible for the targeted offer of ELC in Scotland. The Scottish Government envisages that this data share will improve the take-up of the offer for funded childcare for 2 year olds.</p>

<p>The proposed objective will allow Scottish local authorities to target eligible families, informing them of their potential eligibility to funding. It will enable Scottish local authorities to ensure that families facing the most disadvantage are made aware of the ELC offer and promote improved access to entitlement.</p>

<p>The consultation closed on 7 March 2022 and this report summarises the responses, including our responses to the recommendations.</p>

<p>A list of organisations who responded is at Annex A.</p>

<h2>Summary of responses</h2>

<p>A total of 69 responses to the consultation paper were received. Of these, 55% were submitted by organisations and 45% of respondents identified themselves as individuals.</p>

<p>A clear majority of respondents agreed that the proposed data share would improve and target a service to eligible households (94%) and thereby improve their wellbeing (88%). Respondents also agreed (86%) that the data sharing would deliver tangible benefits to households, including early stage support to promote education, health and social equalities.</p>

<p>The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the personal data items to be shared - specifically include the customer name, address and National Insurance number (for unique identification), as well as a child(ren) indicator to confirm the existence of a child, or children, is consistent with the delivery of the objective (87%).</p>

<p>Over half (55%) of the respondents indicated that they expect no individual and/or household to incur a loss of benefit/s as a result of the implementation of this proposal. Most respondents (64%) do not anticipate that the proposal will lead to any individual and/or households incurring a loss of access to services.</p>

<p>The majority of respondents (61%) did not perceive the implementation of the proposed data sharing objective would lead to any equality issues.</p>

<h2>Comments on ELC in Scotland</h2>

<p>We received a substantial number of comments around the ELC provision in Scotland rather than the proposed data sharing objective to support the existing scheme.</p>

<p>Broadly, respondents expressed that they believed that take up of the offer would allow children to develop and that families would be better supported through take-up of the ELC offer.</p>

<p>Respondents identified 3 key barriers to take up of the funded childcare scheme including;</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lack of understanding of potential financial implications of take up for families, particularly those who are in receipt of benefits</li>
  <li>a lack of awareness of the offer and eligibility</li>
  <li>reported difficulties with the current application process which involves families determining their eligibility and reaching out to DWP to request evidence of eligibility. The application process is lengthy and time consuming, and reportedly most families do not follow through with completing their application</li>
</ul>

<p>The data sharing objective seeks to reduce these barriers to take up, which will improve long term outcomes for the children and families. Many respondents acknowledged the benefits of data sharing as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it will support Scottish Government and Scottish local authorities with identifying, targeting and contacting families who are likely to meet the threshold for the eligibility criteria</li>
  <li>allow local authorities to drive take up of the offer for funded hours, and in doing so, will deliver a benefit to the child and household</li>
</ul>

<p>A minority of respondents suggested that children and families could be adversely affected as a result of taking up the funded hours and that the ELC or nursery setting is not appropriate for the emotional and developmental needs of every child.</p>

<p>Respondents included constructive suggestions around the strategy of ELC delivery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a number of respondents advised that the Scottish Government should consider adopting a collaborative approach to drive take-up of the targeted offer. Families build positive relationships with front line staff; health visitors, General Practitioners, social workers and family nurses. Parents may be more inclined to apply for the offer if they are informed of/referred to consider the provision by front line staff</li>
  <li>There have been comments around the need to remove the stigma to ensure the successful delivery of the targeted offer</li>
  <li>Recommendations were made to ensure that families should be approached with sensitivity and that communication should promote parental choice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scottish Government response</h2>

<p>As the majority of comments in the ELC offer relate to Scottish Government policy and procedures in Scotland, the Scottish Government has set out clarification here.</p>

<p>Access to funded ELC provision is expected to deliver significant benefits to children and families. Evidence shows that those who face the most disadvantage, benefit the most:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Children’s development improves and the attainment gap narrows</li>
  <li>Parents opportunities to be in work, training or study increase</li>
  <li>Family wellbeing improves through enhanced nurture and support</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, a number of those who stand to benefit most from access to high quality funded ELC are not taking up their entitlement at age 2. While almost all children access their entitlement at age 3, we estimate fewer than half of those eligible at age 2, access their entitlement. The Scottish Government has undertaken a number of pieces of work since 2014 (when 2 year olds were included in the definition of an eligible child) and uptake of the offer has increased over time. However, research suggests that awareness of the offer remains a significant barrier to uptake.</p>

<p>Developing effective data sharing with Scottish local authorities is one part of a broader programme of work to support the maximisation of the 2 year old offer in Scotland. Other examples of the Scottish Government’s work on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.parentclub.scot/articles/early-learning-and-childcare-in-scotland-is-changing" rel="external">“This Much”</a> marketing campaign and Parent Club content was designed with parents and carers of two-year-olds in mind using messages tested with parents of potential eligible two-year-olds</li>
  <li>The Scottish Government is working with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.improvementservice.org.uk/products-and-services/consultancy-and-support/early-learning-and-childcare-expansion" rel="external">Improvement Service</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cypic.co.uk/quality-improvement-resources-old/quality-improvement-examples/early-innovation/" rel="external">Children and Young People Improvement Collaborative</a> to support local authorities, and their partners, to maximise uptake of their local offer</li>
  <li>Across local areas and at a national level the Scottish Government is working with ‘trusted professionals’ including Health Visitors and the Family Nurse Partnership Programme to provide information on the offer to ensure those who have the closest links with families have the right information at the right time</li>
  <li>The Scottish Government continues to work with those delivering devolved benefits such as Best Start Grant and Best Start Foods, to ensure we use every opportunity to raise awareness with potentially eligible families</li>
  <li>For families who are not eligible through their receipt of one of the Qualifying Benefits that are subject to this data sharing work, there are ongoing discussions with local authorities and relevant stakeholders to ensure they have the information they need to make the most of the systems they have in place to support these families</li>
  <li>Following the announcement of new childcare commitments in the Programme for Government 2021, the Scottish Government has also now committed to undertake an eligibility review that will identify the best approach to expanding access to funded childcare. This will include how to develop consistent approaches to eligibility for all Scottish childcare offers that will ensure a simple, joined up approach for families.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work to develop this data sharing objective is therefore one project that is focussed on a specific subset of eligible families - those that are in receipt of the qualifying benefits that are administered by DWP or HMRC. The work is broadly split into two parts: establishing the legal gateway; and developing the data sharing mechanism itself.</p>

<p>This consultation relates to the creation of the legal gateway which provides the legal basis on which we can request DWP and HMRC share data with the Scottish Government and Scottish local authorities for this specific purpose.</p>

<p>Developing the process to share the data itself is running concurrently and we are reassured that we are addressing the issues raised in the detailed comments from respondents within that work on the process itself. We have been holding discussions with DWP, HMRC and a selection of Scottish LAs over a number of months to establish how and what data can be shared following the principles of good data management.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have limited the data we have requested from DWP and HMRC to what is absolutely necessary in order to meet the objective (i.e we have not requested child data beyond a defined age range including 2 year-olds and some younger children to ensure we are able to notify families in advance of their child turning 2 and therefore maximise the full benefit from early childcare)</li>
  <li>We are providing data to local authorities rather than writing out directly from the Scottish Government so that local authorities can provide information to households on the specific local offer</li>
  <li>Local authorities have confirmed they are able to accommodate receiving this new data and have been central to requesting this data sharing is progressed</li>
  <li>We are aligning the points at which the local authority will receive the data with the termly start dates set out in legislation</li>
</ul>

<p>This work with local authorities is ongoing and the Scottish Government will continue to support them as required as they develop their processes to accommodate the new data they will receive. The Scottish Government will continue to log all detailed comments and will ensure the valuable input is reflected in the final product.</p>

<h2>Responses to specific questions - section one: The early learning and childcare objective in relation to the public service delivery power of the Digital Economy Act 2017</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question 1: To what extent do you agree that the proposed new objective meets the first condition set out in s35 (9) of the Digital Economy Act 2017?</p>

<p>The first condition has as its purpose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The improvement or targeting of a public service provided to individuals or households, or</li>
  <li>The facilitation of the provision of a benefit (whether or not financial) to individuals or households</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 1</h3>

<p>Overall, a clear majority of respondents (94%) agreed or strongly agreed that the proposed objective meets the first condition set out in s35 (9) of the Digital Economy Act 2017.</p>

<p>Few respondents neither agree nor disagree (4%) and 2% disagree or strongly disagree. Analysis of the comments and feedback from respondents show that 46% of respondents have said that they expect that the data sharing to take place will deliver a benefit to children and families.</p>

<p>Of those who put forward additional comments, 16% discussed the support that families will receive including improving outcomes, enabling parents to allocate time to seek employment, and study or training opportunities.</p>

<p>The majority of respondents agree that the data sharing objective will allow local authorities to effectively identify, target and contact eligible families to raise awareness of the ELC scheme, which will in turn increase take up.</p>

<p>We received comments around the expected benefits of the data sharing proposal including improved targeting of the scheme and removing inequalities by closing the attainment gap and supporting families.</p>

<p>Local authorities highlighted the challenges with raising awareness of the scheme and confusion around the eligibility criteria which impact the rates of take up, but flagged that the benefits of data sharing include identifying and directly contacting eligible families and allowing families to make well informed decisions.</p>

<p>Many respondents indicated that a lack of awareness is a significant factor which affects uptake of the offer, agreeing that the proposed objective meets the first condition both to help target a public service provided to individuals or households and to facilitate the provision of a benefit to individuals or households and so remove barriers to uptake of the offer.</p>

<h3>Government response to question 1</h3>

<p>The Government thanks all organisations and individuals who responded to the question on the extent to which the objective will improve to target ELC provision to individuals and households, or provide them with a benefit. The UK Government will take forward the data sharing legislation to help the Scottish Government and local authorities ensure that eligible families in Scotland get the help that they need.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question 2: To what extent do you agree that the proposed new objective meets the second condition set out in s35 (10) of the Digital Economy Act 2017?</p>

<p>The second condition is that the objective has as its purpose the improvement of the well-being of individuals or households.</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 2</h3>

<p>A significant majority (88%) agreed or strongly agreed to the question relating to whether the objective meets the second condition set out in s35 (10) of the Digital Economy Act 2017.</p>

<p>Responses with neither agree nor disagree and strongly disagree/disagree were significantly less at 9% and 3% respectively</p>

<p>Respondents recognised the positive impacts that access to the ELC provision is likely to deliver:</p>

<ul>
  <li>closing the poverty related attainment gap by addressing developmental needs of children at an early age</li>
  <li>increased wellbeing for children and families through take up of the scheme</li>
  <li>improving outcomes for children and families</li>
  <li>improved fine and gross motor skills</li>
  <li>improved communication skills through interaction with other children/adults</li>
  <li>high quality ELC</li>
  <li>enabling parents to take on study, training and employment opportunities</li>
  <li>application of early intervention where a developmental need is identified</li>
</ul>

<p>One responding organisation supported the work as a way for LAs to promote the full range of options families have access to in their local area. For example, promoting the benefits of a childminding place for younger children where home-based and one to one nurturing care can be provided. Local authorities have acknowledged that two year olds are likely to benefit from access to funded ELC to support their development across all developmental milestones. Respondents have commented that they expect that this will improve outcomes in the long term, addressing and closing the attainment gap.</p>

<p>A local authority has also stated that they expect take up of the entitlement will support families to access work or training to address social and economic disadvantage, promoting family wellbeing.</p>

<p>Several respondents have identified lack of access to childcare as a factor which impacts parents ability to seek employment or study opportunities. The respondent recognises that a lack of awareness of the scheme is currently a barrier to eligible parents taking up childcare.</p>

<p>Respondents have identified various ways in which the data sharing objective could contribute to the wellbeing of individuals and households including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing overall stress while enabling the parent to plan for the future, take up learning, training, study or work. This could potentially support the family with income and sustainability</li>
  <li>deliver a benefit to families where a parent or child has additional support needs, a health issue or a disability by providing respite and alleviating stress.</li>
  <li>high quality early learning and childcare from age two has been found to particularly enhance outcomes for young children.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Government response to question 2</h3>

<p>The Government thanks all organisations and individuals who responded to the question on the extent to which the objective will improve the well-being of individuals and households. The UK Government has a clear duty to support citizens in areas where they are responsible, such as reserved benefits, and will take forward the data sharing legislation to help the Scottish Government and local authorities ensure that eligible families in Scotland get the help that they need.</p>

<p>Question 3: To what extent do you agree that the proposed new objective meets the third condition set out in s35 (12) of the Digital Economy Act 2017?</p>

<p>The third condition is that the objective has as its purpose the supporting of -</p>

<ul>
  <li>The delivery of a specified person’s functions, or</li>
  <li>The administration, monitoring or enforcement of a specified person’s functions</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 3</h3>

<p>Most respondents (75%) agreed or strongly agreed to the question relating to whether the objective meets the third condition set out in s35 (12) of the Digital Economy Act 2017.</p>

<p>A number of respondents neither agree nor disagree (22%) and 3% disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p>

<p>Respondents also asked for clarification on the third condition and how it may impact on the proposed objective.</p>

<h3>Government response to question 3</h3>

<p>Several respondents commented that they felt that this question did not offer enough clarity or information for respondents to be able to provide an informed answer.</p>

<p>Data sharing objectives must support the delivery of a specified public authority’s functions, which includes the administration, monitoring or enforcement of the delivery of the function. We recognise that government departments’ functions can be complex and will provide more explanation in future public consultations on data sharing.</p>

<p>Question 4: To what extent do you agree that the data to be shared as outlined under this proposed objective is consistent with the delivery of the objective?</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 4</h3>

<p>The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the personal data items to be shared - specifically include the customer name, address and National Insurance number (for unique identification), as well as a child(ren) indicator to confirm the existence of a child, or children, is consistent with the delivery of the objective (87%). Several respondents recognised that data sharing would enable Scottish Government and local authorities to identify and target families and to inform them of likely eligibility.</p>

<p>A number of respondents neither agree nor disagree (10%) and 3% disagreed or strongly disagreed.</p>

<p>Respondents agreed that the minimum amount of data to be shared is consistent with the delivery of this objective. However, a small number of respondents raised potential privacy and confidentiality issues which may arise as a result of the data sharing activity, for example, ensuring that the data to be collected is used for the purposes of the targeting the ELC offer only.</p>

<p>We received positive reassurance from Scottish local authorities, with many welcoming the proposal. Local authorities are content that the data sharing to take place will allow them to better target the offer to families who can benefit from the scheme. This will in turn allow local authorities to remove a significant barrier to take up by raising awareness of eligibility.</p>

<p>Comments around the data sharing process itself were put forward in response to this question. These are related to the frequency of the data sharing and the impact this may have on families becoming aware of their child’s entitlement in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>Government response to question 4</h3>

<p>The Government thanks all organisations and individuals who responded to the question on the extent the data will support delivery of the objective. The UK Government recognises concerns raised on data privacy and has ensured, and will continue to ensure, that data sharing under the Digital Economy Act 2017 complies with data protection legislation, the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, and the Information Commissioner’s Office Data Sharing Code of Practice. All parties to the data share will ensure that data is held securely, to the appropriate security and information management standards, maintained to the appropriate quality, used only for the specified purpose of ELC, kept only as long as necessary and then securely deleted. Any and all data shares under the proposed objective will be included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-information-sharing-agreements-under-chapters-1-2-3-and-4-of-part-5-of-the-digital-economy-act-2017">Register of information sharing agreements</a> established under chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 of part 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-information-sharing-agreements-under-chapters-1-2-3-and-4-of-part-5-of-the-digital-economy-act-2017">Digital Economy Act 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Question 5: To what extent do you consider that the proposed new objective supports the delivery of described benefits to the specified individuals and/or households?</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 5</h3>

<p>A clear majority of respondents considered that the proposed new objective supports ELC delivery to eligible households. (86% strongly agree and agree)</p>

<p>A number of respondents opted for neither agree nor disagree and strongly disagree/disagree, 11% and 3% respectively.</p>

<p>Respondents have identified benefits that take up of the early learning and childcare provision will deliver:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased ability to identify developmental needs of children and application of appropriate interventions at an early stage, consequently contributing to narrowing of the poverty related attainment gap</li>
  <li>access to high quality early learning and childcare could potentially reduce health and social inequalities</li>
  <li>increased attainment</li>
  <li>increased wellbeing for families</li>
  <li>builds confidence in parents own wellbeing and life, opportunities to take up employment, training and study</li>
</ul>

<p>From those who provided additional views, 3% of respondents commented the targeted offer may have an adverse effect on children and/or families:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This could be due to the individual circumstances of families and whether the provision is appropriate for the needs of the family</li>
  <li>Eligible families could also feel pressured into applying for the scheme, particularly if they are not clear about whether the benefits they are in receipt of will be affected as a result of turning down the offer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comments around capacity and resourcing issues were also raised (3%) as an issue which could impact the delivery of the provision</p>

<h3>Government response to question 5</h3>

<p>The Government thanks all organisations and individuals who responded to the question on the extent the objective will deliver the benefits to individuals and households. The UK Government will take forward the data sharing legislation to help the Scottish Government and local authorities ensure that eligible families in Scotland get the help that they need.

<h3>Summary of responses to question 6</h3>

<p>This question seeks to ascertain whether respondents perceive the implementation of the proposed objective to lead to a loss of benefit/s.</p>

<p>Over half (55%) of the respondents have responded with disagree/strongly disagree and have indicated that they expect no individual and/or household to incur a loss of benefit/s as a result of the implementation of this proposal.</p>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 7</h3>

<p>This question seeks to ascertain whether respondents perceive the implementation of the proposed objective to lead to a loss of access to services.</p>

<h3>Government response to question 7</h3>

<p>The Government thanks all organisations and individuals who responded to the question on the extent the objective will lead to a loss of access to services. The Scottish Government will continue to consider eligibility for access to funded ELC.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question 8: Do you think the objective proposal raises any equality questions?</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 8</h3>

<p>The majority of respondents (61%) did not perceive the implementation of the proposed data sharing objective would lead to any equality issues.</p>

<p>20% of respondents reported that they expected the proposed objective to lead to equality issues and a further 19% of respondents were not sure.</p>

<p>Analysis of comments from respondents revealed that 22% expressed support for the objective, drawing on the benefits that would be delivered as a result of the proposed data sharing.</p>

<p>Of those who provided comments, 14% of respondents raised inequalities which may arise as a result of the current ELC scheme rather than the data sharing objective proposed. Inequalities highlighted were those that may occur as a result of the capacity issues with childcare providers, for example, implications for children of parents who rely on childcare as they are in full time employment, and 3 and 4 year olds who may be affected by the additional strain on services. Limitations of the current eligibility criteria which is determined by income were also mentioned, with the suggestion that eligibility criteria determined by the needs of the child could deliver better outcomes.</p>

<h3>Government response to question 8</h3>

<p>The Government thanks all organisations and individuals who responded to the question on the extent the objective raises equality issues. The Scottish Government reiterates that work to develop this data sharing is one project that is focussed on a specific subset of eligible families - those that are in receipt of the qualifying benefits that are administered by DWP or HMRC. Other eligibility criteria are in place, for example for children with experience of care and the children of parents who have experience of care.</p>

<p>The Scottish Government will continue to consider eligibility for access to funded ELC.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that Scottish local authorities have discretion to provide access to funded ELC to any child they see fit. This means that many already provide access to children based on local priorities, including needs of the child or family.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question 9: Do you have further comments on the suitability of this proposed objective?</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary of responses to question 9</h3>

<ul>
  <li>driving take up of the offer</li>
  <li>raising awareness of entitlement</li>
  <li>enabling local authorities to streamline the application process which currently involves applicants evidencing eligibility through requesting paperwork from HMRC and DWP.</li>
</ul>

<p>13% of those who put forward views, commented on how the objective and/or current scheme could be reviewed to deliver a wider benefit. Described benefits include providing additional support to families who meet the threshold of the eligibility criteria including, for example, clothing grants and free school meals.</p>
