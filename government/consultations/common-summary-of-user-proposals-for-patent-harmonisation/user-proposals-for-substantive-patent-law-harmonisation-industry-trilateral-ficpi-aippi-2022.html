<p>The Industry Trilateral and the Group B+ are engaged in work on substantive patent law harmonisation. In the autumn of 2021, the Industry Trilateral released their “Elements Paper” of September 2020, a work in progress proposing a package of norms which could serve as a basis for achieving global substantive patent law harmonisation, and it was decided that the Group B+ delegations would consult their users on the package. Within Europe, it was decided that such a consultation should be carried out in a concerted manner, based on a Common Consultation Document, and also encompass other existing user proposals emanating from FICPI and AIPPI.</p>

<p>The present Common Consultation Document aims to collect feedback from European stakeholders with regard to proposed norms governing the grace period, prior user rights and conflicting applications.</p>
</div>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h3>

<p>In the 21st century, globally, national patent systems present a fragmented landscape. International harmonisation of substantive patent law is an effort which has been ongoing for several decades, on and off. It is a challenging endeavour, but one which remains high on the list of priorities of stakeholders. Users of the system in particular often state that they need harmonisation, and many users have understood that for it to be achieved, change must be embraced by all.</p>

<p>The Group B+ is an informal forum composed of around 45 industrialised countries, as well as the European Commission and the EPO, which has been working on substantive patent law harmonisation.</p>

<p>Since 2014, the Industry Trilateral (composed of representatives from the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO), BusinessEurope and the Japan Intellectual Property Association (JIPA)) has been working on a proposal for a package of norms which could form the basis for international substantive patent law harmonisation, through a working group which has been meeting regularly in person and online.</p>

<p>In September 2020, the Industry Trilateral presented to the Group B+ delegations an updated version of their “Elements Paper”, but placed it under an embargo. This embargo was lifted in October 2021, releasing the document for public distribution. It contains their unfinished and not-yet-agreed draft proposal for a package of norms. Nevertheless, given the considerable investment of the Industry Trilateral in their paper and the innovations which the paper contains, it was considered appropriate and helpful to the process to consult stakeholders on their views at this juncture.</p>

<p>In November 2021, at a meeting of the Patent Law Committee of the European Patent Organisation, the member states agreed that there should be a concerted consultation of stakeholders in Europe, based on an agreed common consultation document, so as to be able to (i) compare the data yielded in each of the EPO member states, across jurisdictions, as well as across technical sectors, user size and activity profiles, and (ii) consolidate the results, to have a European overview of stakeholder positions.</p>

<p>However, the Elements Paper is not the only user input on the table. In 2018, in response to developments within the Industry Trilateral/Group B+, the International Federation of Intellectual Property Attorneys (FICPI) issued a paper entitled “FICPI Position on Patent Law Harmonization (Group B+)”, encompassing proposed norms on the grace period, conflicting applications and prior user rights.</p>

<p>Finally, over the years, and also partly in response to developments within the Industry Trilateral/Group B+, the International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property (AIPPI) has produced a set of relevant Resolutions on: the grace period (2013); prior user rights (2014); publication of patent applications (2016); and conflicting applications (2018). The European delegations took the view that, although these Resolutions were not formally consolidated, considered together, they formed a coherent package.</p>

<p>The European delegations thus decided to extend the consultation beyond the Industry Trilateral package to both the FICPI Proposal and the AIPPI Resolutions. These user proposals are detailed and voluminous. All are appended in their integrity in Annexes I-III to this document. To facilitate the consultation of users, however, it was decided that the proposals would be summarised in table form, focused on the individual issues and proposed norms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Scope of the consultation</h3>

<p>The Industry Trilateral Elements Paper contains norms governing five areas: the definition of prior art, the grace period, 18-month publication of applications, conflicting applications and prior user rights. Of these areas, the definition of prior art and the rules governing the mandatory publication of applications at 18 months are arguably already harmonised throughout the world (with the exception of the United States), and the Industry Trilateral paper is essentially aligned on these points with the European Patent Convention (EPC). The FICPI and AIPPI proposals do not suggest any changes to these norms. Thus, in an attempt to streamline and simplify, it has been decided to consult European users only on the norms relative to the grace period, conflicting applications and prior user rights contained in these user proposals. However, it should be remembered that these proposed norms would be part of a package including a harmonised definition of prior art and mandatory 18-month publication aligned with the EPC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Background on the issues</h3>

<h4>Grace period</h4>

<p>A grace period can be defined as a period of time prior to the filing of an application, during which an applicant can disclose their invention without losing the possibility of obtaining patent protection in that jurisdiction. Many countries have grace periods, which can be defined in different ways with different scopes. Japan and Korea have grace periods subject to strict statement requirements: if the applicant does not list a disclosure, it will not be graced. Australia does not have a statement requirement, but provides that prior user rights may be acquired by any third party who uses an invention prior to the filing or priority date, at a time when the invention was in the public domain, even if this is as a result of obtaining knowledge of the invention through a pre-filing disclosure by the applicant. The US has a broad grace period without a statement, and prohibits the acquisition of prior user rights throughout the grace period.</p>

<p>Europe currently operates under a strict novelty requirement, so that any disclosure of the invention prior to the filing date results in the invention no longer being considered new, and thus not being patentable. This is subject to two narrow exceptions found in Article 55 EPC: (a) the invention was disclosed as a result of an evident abuse of the applicant or their legal predecessor; or (b) the invention was displayed at an officially recognised international exhibition (i.e. an exhibition falling within the terms of the Convention on international exhibitions, and listed as such, which is extremely rare). Under this novelty requirement, whether a document forms prior art against an application or not can be simply assessed, often on the face of the document. If the disclosure date is known and prior to the filing date, the disclosure is prior art regardless of who published the item, so that drawing up validity and freedom-to-operate opinions is correspondingly simple and cost-effective, promoting legal certainty.</p>

<h4>Conflicting applications</h4>

<p>All patent systems must address the issue of an application having been filed before the filing or priority date of the application being examined, but published later, where both applications disclose common subject-matter. Such applications are said to “conflict” because the content of the earlier-filed application only becomes publicly available as prior art after the filing or priority date of the application being examined. In the absence of a rule giving prior art effect to the earlier-filed application as of its filing or priority date, it would thus be possible for two or more patents to be granted covering the same or similar subject-matter.</p>

<p>The treatment of conflicting applications is different under the legal regimes in Europe, the United States and Japan. In Europe, under the EPC, as well as under the national law of the EPC contracting states, earlier-filed, later-published applications (“secret prior art”) are relevant to the examination of novelty only. All applicants are treated the same and there is no anti-self-collision.</p>

<p>In the US, secret prior art is relevant to the examination of both novelty and inventive step, and “anti-self-collision” is provided for, advantaging the first mover by ensuring that their own prior applications will not constitute secret prior art against subsequent applications filed by them, although their prior applications will constitute secret prior art for any subsequent applications filed by third parties.</p>

<p>In Japan, secret prior art is relevant to the examination of a sort of “enhanced novelty”, so that the earlier application can destroy the novelty of the subsequent one even if there are minor differences, provided the inventions are “substantially the same”, but earlier applications are not relevant for examination of inventive step, with anti-self-collision also applying.</p>

<p>There are likewise differences among the jurisdictions as to the conditions under which PCT international applications become secret prior art. In Japan and under the EPC, such applications become secret prior art as of the international filing or priority date only if they enter into the respective national/regional phase, which also entails that they have been translated into the prescribed language(s). In the US, PCT applications form secret prior art as of their international filing or priority date merely upon designation of the United States in the international application, i.e. at the date of their publication after 18 months.</p>

<h4>Prior user rights</h4>

<p>A prior user right is the right of a party to continue the use of an invention where that use began before a patent application was filed for the same invention. The main purpose of prior user rights is to strike a balance between the effects of the first-to-file principle on the one hand and the interests of third parties who have knowledge of the invention and have begun investing in the invention with the intention of commercially exploiting it on the other.</p>

<p>Prior user rights are provided for by the different national patent legislations and such provisions thus only have national effect. However, whilst the national provisions on prior user rights may have common ground, there are also differences in the conditions under which they may be acquired and the definition of their scope depending on the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Prior user rights do not fall under the purview of the EPC, as they are a post-grant mechanism. They are nevertheless included in the harmonisation process as they are deemed by some to be relevant to the definition of a balanced grace period. The possibility of prior user rights arising where use of an invention has been made as a result of it having been put in the public domain by an applicant’s pre-filing disclosure may create a risk curbing the use of the grace period by applicants, which then increases legal certainty. If the grace period is invoked only exceptionally and not strategically, arguably, the patent system continues to operate on a file-first, disclose-later principle, as under the current EPC.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span> Background on the user association</h3>

<h3>The Industry Trilateral</h3>

<p>The Industry Trilateral (IT3) was formed in 2003 for stakeholders to engage with the Trilateral Offices (EPO, JPO and USPTO) on substantive and procedural issues of patent law. As mentioned above, it is composed of representatives from four associations: AIPLA, IPO, BusinessEurope and JIPA.</p>

<p>AIPLA (American Intellectual Property Association) is a US national bar association of approximately 8 500 members (August 2021) who are engaged in private or corporate practice, in government service and in the academic community, representing both owners and users of intellectual property.</p>

<p>IPO (Intellectual Property Owners’ Association) is a US-based international trade association representing companies and individuals in all industries and fields of technology that own or are interested in intellectual property rights. IPO’s membership includes more than 200 companies and more than 12 000 individuals (April 2021) who are involved in the association either through their companies or as inventor, author, executive, law firm or attorney members.</p>

<p>BusinessEurope is a federation of 40 national business federations from 35 European countries representing some 20 million enterprises of various sizes throughout Europe.</p>

<p>JIPA (Japan Intellectual Property Association) is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation which has 1 346 company members. It represents industries and users of the intellectual property system.</p>

<h4>FICPI</h4>

<p>Founded over 100 years ago, FIPCI (International Federation of Intellectual Property Attorneys) is a Switzerland-based international representative association for patent attorneys in private practice throughout the world, with about 5 500 members in 86 countries and regions, across six continents. For many years, FICPI has been engaged in an ongoing analysis of the grace period and related harmonisation topics. More recently, a FICPI Working Group was created to study specifically the harmonisation issues raised by the Industry Trilateral/B+ Sub-Group. The core FICPI Working Group comprised members from 11 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Beyond this core group, extensive discussions within FICPI led to an international consensus at the Executive Committee in Toronto, June 2018, resulting in the paper appended to this consultation document.</p>

<h4>AIPPI</h4>

<p>AIPPI (International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property)  is a not-for-profit, politically neutral international association based in Switzerland with about 8 000 members worldwide from more than 131 countries. Members of AIPPI are individuals interested in intellectual property protection on a national or international level and include lawyers, patent attorneys, patent agents and trade mark agents, as well as judges, scientists, engineers and corporations. AIPPI is organised into 68 National and two Regional Groups and membership is obtained by joining one of these groups. In countries where no group exists, membership is obtained as an independent member in the international organisation. Working method: a questionnaire on a specific topic is sent to all the country groups, which then produce a country report. All the country reports are then sent to the Reporting General Team, made up of one delegate from all the country associations, who draw up a draft resolution, which then gets amended and adopted in a plenary meeting.</p>

(p. 3; Annex 1, p.1))The proposal contains two incentives to file an application as soon as possible after a PFD: independent disclosures by third parties in the interval between a pre-filing disclosure and the filing of the application form prior art; and prior user rights may accrue during that interval.

(p.26)<br><br>The DIU would allow the third party to continue any activities begun as a result of such reliance. The third party’s qualifying activities for the DIU and its scope would be the same as those for the PUR.

(p.26)<br><br>The applicant would lose the right to grace the PFD if they did not file the statement in a timely manner after being informed of the PFD. (p.27)<br><br>In order to ensure compliance with Art. 4B of the Paris Convention, while qualifying activities could begin prior to the end of the priority period, the DIU would not accrue until after the priority period expired.

(p.20)</td>
      <td>FICPI supports PURs as an essential element in a first-to-file or first-inventor-to-file patent system, and is often considered a necessary supplement to the grace period. (Annex 3, p. 1 and 5) <br><br>Third parties may acquire prior user rights irrespective of a disclosure made by the inventor before the filing date under the grace period, provided that all other criteria for obtaining prior user rights are met. (p.3, Annex 3, p.2) The grace period should not affect the prior user rights of third parties. (Annex 1, p.6)<br><br>The universal adoption of a grace period of a safety-net type wherein prior user rights may be acquired during the grace period does not change the basic principle of how a first-to-file system operates and motivates the applicant not to delay the filing of a patent application after a pre-filing disclosure beyond the necessary time to prepare proper application documents. (p.10)</td>
      <td>Prior user rights are rarely invoked, but are nevertheless considered an important part of a balanced patent law system (p.4)<br><br>The PUR should be recognised as an exception to the exclusive rights of the patent holder afforded by the patent (p.4)<br><br>The three main justifications for PURs are balancing the effects of a first-to-file system with the right to lawfully continue an activity carried out in good faith, providing incentive for innovation and dissemination of information without unduly restricting investment, and preserving the freedom to choose between patent protection and secret use. (p.4)<br><br>The issue merits further study, particularly with regard to the scope of the right. (p.4)</td>

At a minimum, the qualifying activity must be directed to the invention as set forth in one or more claims in the patent, and not simply a part thereof. (p.20)<br><br>(See further explanations pp. 20-23)<br><br>One view is that the court should use equitable rules that provide the court with discretion to fashion a fair scope of defence on a case by case basis.

(Please see explanations, pp.22 and 24.)<br><br>No PUR accrues for activities conducted during the 18 months prior to the publication of the application. If the statement is filed with the application, publication of the application is accelerated to 18 months from the first PFD, so that in practice, no PUR could be based on knowledge derived from a PFD.<br><br>PURs would be available only for activities conducted prior to a date 18 months prior to publication of the application, i.e. where the statement was filed late, impacting upon the acceleration of the publication of the application, leaving a gap between the earliest PFD and the beginning of the 18-month period prior to the publication of the application barring accrual of PURs. (p.24)<br><br><strong>Thus, in case of derivation, the policy behind the PUR is not to preserve the investments of the third party, and balance the grace period, but to provide an incentive for applicants to file their statement (not their application) in a timely manner.</strong>
