<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction and summary of proposals</h2>

<p>1. Addressing climate change is one of the major challenges we face in the UK and globally. The UK government is a world leader in commitments to transition to a low carbon economy and in 2019 set the target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>2. Investment in more sustainable projects and activities is essential in order to reduce climate change and to mitigate its impacts. Investors will also need to understand and manage the financial risks and opportunities arising from climate change in order to protect and grow their assets and cashflow.</p>

<p>3. To enable investors to make high-quality decisions and to encourage better pricing and capital allocation in markets, high quality disclosures will be needed regarding how their assets will affect and be affected by climate change.</p>

<p>4. The international Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (<abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>) published a set of recommendations in 2017 with the aims of improving assessment, management, and disclosure of climate-related financial risks. In November 2020, the government announced the UK’s intention to make <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>-aligned disclosures mandatory in the UK across the economy by 2025, with a significant portion of mandatory requirements in place by 2023. The joint <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-joint-regulator-and-government-tcfd-taskforce-interim-report-and-roadmap">Government Regulators Taskforce’s Interim Report, and accompanying roadmap</a>, published alongside the announcement, sets out an indicative pathway to achieving that ambition.</p>

<p>5. In July 2021, the government went further by announcing its new, economy-wide Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (<abbr title="Sustainability Disclosure Requirements">SDR</abbr>) regime. This regime will build on the UK’s world-leading implementation of the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations and streamline UK sustainability reporting. <abbr title="Sustainability Disclosure Requirements">SDR</abbr> will be broader than financial risk, extending to environmental impact (including disclosures based on definitions contained in the UK Green Taxonomy), and over time, to factors beyond climate, including broader sustainability factors such as environmental and social considerations.</p>

<p>6. In October 2021, the government published details of the regime, along with an implementation pathway, in its publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greening-finance-a-roadmap-to-sustainable-investing">Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing</a>. This announced the intention to set up an endorsement and adoption function in the UK for standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (<abbr title="International Sustainability Standards Board">ISSB</abbr>). Standards issued by the <abbr title="International Sustainability Standards Board">ISSB</abbr> will not have any legal force in the UK until they have been endorsed and adopted to ensure that the Standards applied in the UK reflect UK circumstances. The government will consult on proposals for a framework to introduce reporting against IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards in the UK in due course. <abbr title="Sustainability Disclosure Requirements">SDR</abbr> for the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> is not covered in this consultation but we will work with the Scheme Advisory Board to develop proposals.</p>

<h3>Role of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>7. The <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> is one of the largest pension schemes in the UK with 6.2 million members and a significant UK and global investor with £342 billion of assets in 2022. It is locally managed and funded by 86 administering authorities (<abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>). The primary purpose of <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> investments is to meet the scheme’s long-term pension liabilities by balancing risk and return appropriately. However, the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>’s scale and market power give it an opportunity to drive change through the investment chain through asset managers to investee companies.</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> are already required to consider factors that are financially material to the performance of their investments, including environmental, social, and corporate governance considerations. They also must have a policy stating how such considerations will be considered in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/946/contents" rel="external">setting their investment strategy</a>. The aim of the proposals in this consultation document is to build on that position by ensuring that the financial risks and opportunities arising specifically from climate change are properly understood and effectively managed by <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>, and that they report transparently on their approach in line with broader UK policy.</p>

<p>9. The government’s view is that the requirements for the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> should set as high a standard as for private schemes. We have therefore made the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/taking-action-on-climate-risk-improving-governance-and-reporting-by-occupational-pension-schemes-response-and-consultation-on-regulations/taking-action-on-climate-risk-improving-governance-and-reporting-by-occupational-pension-schemes">requirements for private schemes</a> the starting point for our proposals but have aimed to take account of the unique features of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> including its local administration and democratic accountability through the <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>10. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/british-energy-security-strategy">UK Energy Security Strategy</a> was published in April 2022 and emphasises the importance of investment in energy by the private sector to improve energy security and support the transition to clean energy. The <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> has an important role to play as a major investor with a commitment to stewardship and engagement. These proposals seek to support that approach to addressing high carbon emissions and discourage any pursuit of lower emissions through withdrawing investment from energy companies.</p>

<p>12.	The remainder of this chapter sets out the background to the proposals. In chapter 2, the proposed actions to be undertaken by <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> are discussed, and chapter 3 sets out the disclosure requirements. Chapter 4 discusses other issues, including our proposal for a Scheme Climate Report and the role of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> asset pools. A summary of the consultation questions is at the end of the document.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<h4>The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations</h4>

<p>13.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> is a global, private sector led group assembled in December 2015 at the instigation of the Financial Stability Board (<abbr title="Financial Stability Board">FSB</abbr>), an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. Following extensive public consultation, they published their recommended disclosures in June 2017.</p>

<p>14.	The recommendations were designed to be adoptable by all organisations, including those inside and outside the financial industry, from asset managers to asset owners, including banks, insurers and pension schemes.</p>

<p>15.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> designed the set of recommendations as a flexible framework for these organisations. The framework is meant to produce decision-useful, forward-looking information on the financial impacts of climate change.  It is also meant to accommodate continued rapid evolution in climate-related modelling, management, and reporting.</p>

<p>16.	The final report included 11 recommendations. These are split into Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Core elements of recommended climate-related financial disclosures</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Core elements of recommended climate-related financial disclosures" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/160780/Core_elements_960.png"></div></figure>

<p><strong>Governance:</strong> The organisation’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> The actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.</p>

<p><strong>Risk Management:</strong> The processes used by the organisation to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks.</p>

<p><strong>Metrics and Targets:</strong> The metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.</p>
</div>

<h4>Benefits of the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations for the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>
</h4>

<p>17.	A <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>-aligned approach to climate risks will offer the opportunity for <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to build on the relatively high-level requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/946/contents" rel="external">Local Government Pensions Scheme (Management and Investment of Funds) Regulations 2016</a>. It permits them to demonstrate how the consideration of climate change risks and opportunities are integrated into the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s entire decision-making process.</p>

<p>18.	Carrying out scenario analysis, reporting on appropriate metrics that include greenhouse gas emissions, and setting appropriate targets, would provide valuable inputs to inform an <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s investment strategy. It would also allow <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to monitor and review progress and to make amendments to the investment strategy where necessary. Disclosing this information would provide greater transparency to members and taxpayers about how their money is being managed.</p>

<p>19.	The flexible structure of the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations also allows <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to continuously improve climate risk governance and reporting in the light of rapidly increasing data quality and completeness and emerging best practice.</p>

<p>20.	Many aspects of the tools and data used for climate-related analysis are still in development, but <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> can take substantive action now to address climate risk and to report on it as part of their duties to scheme members, employers and the public. There are already enough data, analysis and tools to effect real change when <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> use the data to manage risks and opportunities.</p>

<h4>Comparison with regime for private pension schemes</h4>

<p>21.	The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has already introduced requirements on climate risk management and reporting for private pension schemes, in regulations which came into force on 1 October 2021. Implementation will be staged for private pension schemes. Private schemes with £5 billion or more in assets were immediately in scope, with those with £1 billion or more to follow in October 2022. Schemes with less than £1 billion in assets are not currently covered. The DWP has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-and-reporting-of-climate-change-risk-guidance-for-trustees-of-occupational-schemes">statutory guidance on the requirements</a>.</p>

<p>22.	DWP’s intention to implement the UK’s new Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (<abbr title="Sustainability Disclosure Requirements">SDR</abbr>) regime for private pension scheme is outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greening-finance-a-roadmap-to-sustainable-investing">Greening Finance: A Roadmap to Sustainable Investing</a>. <abbr title="Sustainability Disclosure Requirements">SDR</abbr> requirements for the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> are not covered by this consultation.</p>

<p>23.	The proposals set out in this consultation are broadly similar to the requirements for private pension schemes, and encompass the same four areas of governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. However, a key difference is that our proposed requirements will apply to all <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> from 2023/24 regardless of fund size. Currently the assets held by <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> funds range from around £0.5 billion to £25 billion with 65 funds holding less than £5 billion and 8 funds holding less than £1 billion.</p>

<p>24.	We recognise that larger <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> funds are likely to have more capacity to meet new requirements than smaller funds. However, our view is that it would not be right to stage implementation within a single pension scheme in which all funds face climate risks, are democratically accountable and subject to high external scrutiny. We also believe that the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> asset pools can play a key role in supporting implementation (see discussion in Chapter 4).</p>

<p>25.	Another key difference is the proposed requirement to report data quality as a mandatory metric. This aims to help the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> use its scale and market power to drive improvements in the quality of emissions data, which will be a critical factor in raising the quality of climate risk management.</p>

<h4>Other relevant regulated areas</h4>

<p>26.	Pension schemes sit at the top of an investment chain, whereby the assets are usually invested in products via a financial intermediary, who may then invest directly in products such as equities. Therefore, schemes rely on high quality data being provided up the chain to produce meaningful climate related disclosures. In preparing these proposals we have been mindful of regulation in other areas which may impact the ability of <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to carry out the requirements.</p>

<p>27.	The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has consulted on <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>-aligned regulations for certain publicly quoted companies, large private companies, and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs). The requirements came into effect in April 2022<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>28.	The Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>) have introduced a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/instrument/2022/FCA_2022_6.pdf" rel="external">new listing rule and guidance</a> which requires commercial companies with a UK premium listing to include a compliance statement in their annual financial report. This statement must indicate whether the company has made disclosures consistent with the recommendations of the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> or provide an explanation if it has not done so.</p>

<p>29.	In addition, the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> has introduced <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> related rules and guidance at the portfolio and entity level for asset managers, life insurers, and <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>-regulated pension providers. This is particularly relevant to the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> as some of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> asset pools will be subject to these requirements in their capacity as asset managers.</p>

<p>30.	The Pensions Regulator (TPR) also has a role in this area. It has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library/scheme-management-detailed-guidance/funding-and-investment-detailed-guidance/climate-related-governance-and-reporting" rel="external">guidance intended to help trustees of private sector occupational pension schemes</a>. While TPR has no remit regarding the investments of <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> funds, their advice and guidance may be useful for <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> wishing to adopt best practice. In addition, TPR has a role in overseeing the governance of <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>, which would include the governance requirements outlined here.</p>

<p>31.	Our proposals are intended to facilitate consistency across the investment chain and take account of these consultations and requirements by other regulators.</p>

<p>32.	 Finally, we view these proposals as the first step on the journey to implementing in full the new UK Sustainability Disclosures Regime, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-sets-out-how-uk-financial-services-can-create-prosperity-at-home-and-project-values-abroad-in-first-mansion-house-speech">announced by the then Chancellor in July 2021</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Proposed requirements</h2>

<p>33.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations cover requirements in four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. In this chapter, we discuss how these recommendations can be implemented in the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>, taking account of its existing structure and framework. We also set out our proposed requirements for <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>. Proposals on disclosure in relation to each area are discussed in Chapter 3.</p>

<p>34.	The proposed requirements relate only to the assets and liabilities in respect of the pension scheme and not to other <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> activity. For example, emissions caused by travel to meetings, or office provision, would not need to be disclosed as they are not directly attributable to the assets of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>35.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations on governance aim to place development of a robust climate governance framework at the centre of an organisation’s operations. The framework itself is designed to be adoptable by all organisations and easily translatable into sector-specific arrangements.</p>

<p>36.	For <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>, however, we believe that the governance requirements in particular may require some adjustment in order to reflect the nature of their existing governance.</p>

<p>37.	The role of the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s scheme manager is broadly similar to that of the board, as described in the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations. The scheme manager of an <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> usually takes the form of a pensions committee, and is assisted by the local pensions board. The scheme manager is accountable for funding strategy, investment strategy, asset allocation, and overall risk management. It will therefore be responsible for the assessment and management of climate risks and opportunities in relation to the investments. The <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> asset pool in which the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> is a partner, in turn, is responsible for implementation of the investment strategy except in respect of non-pooled assets which remain with the fund.</p>

<p>38.	Decisions on investment matters may therefore be taken by the scheme manager, informed by advice from external advisers and officers, or delegated to an officer or to the pool. All have important roles in effectively assessing and managing climate change risk and opportunities, and all will be central to the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s efforts to fully embed climate risks into their governance processes.</p>

<p>39.	The scheme manager will need to appoint properly qualified advisers, fully consider their advice, and take appropriate action in order to address these risks. The committee’s officers and advisers and the pool, where appropriate, will need to provide advice which is accessible for non-specialists and adequately addresses climate risks to the fund, bringing in additional expertise where needed. We propose to provide statutory guidance to assist <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>. The role of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> asset pools and knowledge and skills requirements are discussed further in Chapter 4.</p>

<p>40.	However, we are not proposing to place any legal duties on individuals, whether officers or advisers, or on the pool. Our proposal is to place new duties on <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establish and maintain, on an ongoing basis, oversight of climate related risks and opportunities</li>
  <li>establish and maintain processes by which they can, on an ongoing basis, satisfy themselves that those who undertake climate-related governance activities, advisors, and those who assist the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> (including officers and advisors) with respect to climate related governance are doing so effectively.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 1: Do you agree with our proposed requirements in relation to governance?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Strategy</h3>

<p>41.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s recommendations on strategy are intended to promote continuous assessment of the implications of climate change for an organisation’s strategy.</p>

<p>42.	For <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>, climate risks will be relevant to both their investment and funding strategies. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will need to consider what physical and transition risks and opportunities may affect both strategies and over what time periods. These may include a wide range of factors, including carbon pricing, adoption of new technology or lower carbon alternatives, and extreme weather events.</p>

<p>43.	<abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will also need to assess the impacts of the identified risks and opportunities over the same time periods on their strategies. They also need to consider what actions to take in response. The assessment will need to take account of the materiality of the risks, and the liquidity and time horizon of the assets, as well as the cashflow and liabilities of the fund.  It will be for the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> to determine the appropriate time periods and to take a view on materiality of risks taking account of these factors.</p>

<p>44.	 We propose to provide  statutory guidance to assist <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to identify risks and opportunities, and to assess the impacts, including consideration of factors to be taken into account.</p>

<p>45.	 Our proposal is to place new duties on <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify, on an ongoing basis, climate-related risks and opportunities that will impact the investment and funding strategy of the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>, over the short, medium and long term.</li>
  <li>assess, on an ongoing basis, the impact of the identified risks and opportunities on the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s investment and funding strategy.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 2: Do you agree with our proposed requirements in relation to strategy?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Scenario analysis</h3>

<p>46.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommends that organisations undertake scenario analysis in order to improve the quality of strategies.  It recommends that organisations consider credible, distinctive, and relevant scenarios for the future path of climate change and that they test the assessment of impacts and the proposed actions against these scenarios.</p>

<p>47.	Scenario analysis is particularly relevant to <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> seeking to assess the medium- and long-term impacts of climate change on their assets, liabilities and strategies. These longer-term potential impacts, as well as sudden events such as climate tipping points, may not be captured by traditional risk management, particularly where there are high levels of uncertainty.  Scenario analysis can also help to create and maintain strategies which take full account of climate risks and opportunities.</p>

<p>48.	We recognise that at present the use of climate scenarios is still new and that current assumptions and methodologies vary. Data quality and availability may also be a problem particularly for some asset classes. Nevertheless, we expect the development of expertise, methodologies, and data to accelerate rapidly in the next few years and hope to see greater consensus in the future.</p>

<p>49.	We therefore propose that regulations would require <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to conduct scenario analysis as far as they are able to. This analysis may be qualitative or quantitative, but we would expect <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to carry out quantitative analysis where possible and to expand the assets covered by quantitative analysis as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>50.	We also propose to provide  statutory guidance on scenario analysis to assist <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>, including guidance on dealing with missing or poor-quality data and other barriers. We would expect <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to aim to do the best scenario analysis that they can, and to aim to improve their scenario analysis over time.</p>

<p>51.	 The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> also recommends that organisations consider a range of climate scenarios, including a scenario based on global temperatures increasing by 2°C or lower over pre-industrial levels. The 2° or lower scenario is important because this level of temperature rise is believed to limit catastrophic physical risks such as flooding and droughts, but there may still be significant short term transition risks due to changes to policy, technology and markets. Scenarios based on higher temperature rises may see more impacts from physical risks both in the short and long term, with lower transition risks.</p>

<p>52.	We therefore believe that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must consider two or more climate-related scenarios, at least one of which must be a scenario of 2°C or lower temperature rise. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will need to assess their assets and liabilities, and their investment and funding strategies against these scenarios.</p>

<p>53.	Investment and funding decisions are made triennially in accordance with the valuation cycle. As scenario analysis should feed into these decisions, we recommend that it is incorporated into the valuation cycle and carried out at least every three years. In the interim years, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should consider whether a new scenario analysis should be carried out to reflect any changes in the fund. In a normal year, where there have been only minor changes in the scheme, we would not expect <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to repeat scenario analysis given it is a substantial piece of work.</p>

<p>54.	We propose to place a new duty on <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess their assets, liabilities, investment strategy and funding strategy against climate risks and opportunities in at least two climate scenarios. This assessment must include at least one scenario based on a global temperature rise of 2°C or lower on pre-industrial levels. This assessment must occur at least once every valuation cycle. In interim years, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must consider whether any changes in the fund have been substantial enough to require scenario analysis to be repeated.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 3: Do you agree with our suggested requirements in relation to scenario analysis?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Risk management</h3>

<p>55.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s recommendations aim to ensure that risk management in relation to climate risks is rigorous, comprehensive, and fully integrated into wider risk management.</p>

<p>56.	In line with the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations, we propose that regulations require that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> identify and assess their fund’s exposure to climate-related risks and take action to manage the risks identified. This will include consideration of both physical and transition risks and the materiality of those risks, as well as proximity and likelihood.</p>

<p>57.	This means having effective processes for identifying climate-related risks and opportunities, and assessing their likely impact on assets, liabilities, investment and funding strategies. We propose that guidance will support <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> in ensuring they have the most appropriate processes in place and that they consider the full range of relevant factors and types of risk and opportunity.</p>

<p>58.	<abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will already have risk management processes in place to manage investment risks. We therefore propose to require <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to integrate these climate-related processes in their existing risk management processes. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> may also wish to identify, assess and take action on climate-related opportunities, and integrate the consideration of these opportunities in their risk management. We propose to provide statutory guidance to assist <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>59.	Our proposed requirements are for <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establish and maintain processes for the purpose of enabling them to identify and assess climate-related risks.</li>
  <li>Establish and maintain processes for the purpose of enabling them to effectively manage climate-related risks.</li>
  <li>Ensure, on an ongoing basis, climate-related risk management processes are integrated into their overall risk management.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 4: Do you agree with our proposed requirements in relation to risk management?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Metrics</h3>

<p>60.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommends that organisations select and disclose metrics to assess and monitor climate risks and opportunities over time. This section discusses the various metrics under consideration.</p>

<p>61.	We propose to require <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to measure and disclose four metrics: Total Carbon Emissions, Carbon Footprint, Data Quality and a Paris Alignment Metric. Total Carbon Emissions and Carbon Footprint both use emissions which can be divided into Scope 1, 2 and 3. The metrics relate to assets held by the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> in respect of paying benefits, not to other activity carried out by the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> such as travel.</p>

<h4>Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions</h4>

<p>62.	Scope 1 emissions are all direct emissions from the activities of an organisation or activities under its control. These emissions include fuel combustion on site such as gas boilers.</p>

<p>63.	Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation. Emissions are created during the production of the energy which is eventually used by the organisation.</p>

<p>64.	Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions from activities of the organisation, occurring from sources that they do not directly control. These are sometimes the greatest share of a carbon footprint, covering emissions associated with business travel, procurement, production of inputs, use of outputs, waste, and water.</p>

<p>65.	Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are much more widely available and reliable statistics, which are highly desirable features in understanding an asset’s carbon exposure. Scope 3 emissions are less widely reported, and when they are reported, they are often calculated on an approximate basis.</p>

<p>66.	For many assets, Scope 3 will be by far the largest single category of emissions, and therefore excluding Scope 3 would significantly underreport total emissions. Excluding Scope 3 emissions will also favour some industries such as online retailers which have low Scope 1 and 2 but high Scope 3 emissions.</p>

<p>67.	Therefore, in including Scope 3 emissions in reporting there is a trade-off. Reporting a figure which includes Scope 3 emissions is subject to more inaccuracy than Scopes 1 and 2. However, we propose to require reporting on all three types of emission as this gives the fullest picture of carbon exposure.</p>

<h4>Absolute emissions metric: Total carbon emissions</h4>

<p>68.	Absolute emissions metrics measure the overall carbon emissions attributable to the fund’s invested assets. A figure for total carbon emissions enables the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> to set a baseline for climate action and to understand the scale of the climate impact of its investments. Without a clear baseline, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> cannot assess the impact of different scenarios.</p>

<p>69.	We propose to require <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to obtain, as far as they are able to Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions for the fund’s assets – that is, the pension scheme’s financed emissions. These are the emissions referred to as category 15 (investment emissions) in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ghgprotocol.org/scope-3-technical-calculation-guidance" rel="external">Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Technical guidance</a>. This measure is referred to as Total Carbon Emissions.</p>

<p>70.	We propose that Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions should be recorded separately and that the sum of the three should also be reported. Therefore, four figures should be reported to comply with the Total Carbon Emissions Metric.</p>

<p>71.	There are different methodologies for attributing carbon emissions to investments. We propose to clarify the appropriate methodology in supporting guidance.</p>

<p>72.	We propose that Total Carbon Emissions is calculated and reported annually via the Climate Risk Report (see Chapter 3).</p>

<p>73.	The Total Carbon Emissions should be reported at the level of the whole of the fund. That is, it should be the total of the carbon emissions of all of the investments it holds. If the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> wishes, they may wish to consider the Total Carbon Emissions for each of its investments separately as well, as doing so may give the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> a clearer picture of where its carbon exposures lie. However, investment level reporting is not required in the annal Climate Risk Report.</p>

<h4>Emissions intensity metric: Carbon footprint</h4>

<p>74.	Absolute emissions are a useful baseline to assess the fund’s overall carbon exposure. However, they are hard to compare across assets and across funds, because larger investments naturally will have larger emissions.</p>

<p>75.	We therefore propose that an Emissions Intensity Metric is calculated in addition. This should be calculated by dividing the Total Carbon Emissions by the total assets held by the fund for which data was available or estimated. This calculation we refer to as Carbon Footprint.</p>

<p>76.	Carbon Footprint is easier to interpret as it does not depend on the size of the investment. A disadvantage of this metric however is that an increase in market capitalisation or revenue, all else being equal, will result in a decrease in the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s emissions per £ million invested.</p>

<p>77.	As explained above, using Scope 1 and 2 emissions only produces a more reliable but less complete picture of carbon exposure. We propose that Carbon Footprint is reported for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, in each case calculated as Scope X Emissions divided by Assets for which Scope X emissions were available or estimated.</p>

<p>78.	We propose that Carbon Footprint is calculated and reported annually via the Climate Risk Report (see Chapter 3).</p>

<p>79.	We propose that only the top-level figure at the whole fund level is required to be produced and reported by <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>80.	We propose that funds should report Carbon Footprint, however if they cannot do so they should report another similar metric such as Weighted Average Carbon Intensity. In these cases, the administering authority should explain why they have done this.</p>

<h4>Data quality and the data quality metric</h4>

<p>81.	The lack of available data is a commonly reported pitfall when schemes seek to calculate the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s emissions metrics. Few, if any, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will be able to obtain full underlying data to allow the calculation of metrics across their whole fund at present.</p>

<p>82.	Where gaps in data do exist, it should be regarded as preferable to use modelling or estimation to fill them, rather than to leave them unaddressed or reporting as null. Beginning with estimated or proxy data can help identify carbon-intensive areas within investments. This also serves as a benchmark for asset-specific data points as and when they become available. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> may choose to calculate metrics and set targets only for assets for which reliable data can be found. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> may also request that service providers analyse their funds using market average techniques and assumption-based modelling.</p>

<p>83.	We regard the inevitable gaps in data as being an important part of the challenge <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> face. We believe that the level of certainty in the data should be understood by those making decisions and should also be visible externally.</p>

<p>84.	We also believe that the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> can play its part in increasing data availability and quality through increasing transparency on data quality and by adopting metrics consistent across the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> and private pension schemes. We therefore propose that regulations require that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> obtain data on data quality as far as they are able and calculate a data quality metric. We also propose that guidance should set out how <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should assess and disclose the quality and availability of data.</p>

<p>85.	We propose that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should state the percentage of the value of their assets for which emissions have been Verified, Reported, Estimated or are Unavailable.</p>

<p>86.	“Verified” and “Reported” are defined as data produced using the methodology for reporting and verifying carbon emissions given in the GHG protocol. Data can be verified by an independent third party, not necessarily an audit firm. “Estimated” includes data which has been estimated, for example using industry averages or modelling based on assumptions.</p>

<p>87.	Where an asset has associated emissions data but the data quality as defined above cannot be confirmed, then it should be classed as estimated. “Unavailable” means that emissions data was unavailable, not that confirmation of the data quality was unavailable.</p>

<p>88.	The data quality metric should be reported for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions separately.</p>

<p>89.	The data quality metric on its own does not replace proper scrutiny of data. Examples of this include data which is “reported” but may not have been reported recently and it may not be completely clear whether emissions relate to a whole company or a subsection of it. “Unknown” data may be known to the company but not submitted to investors. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> are encouraged to ask questions of their fund managers to be effective stewards of their data. Third party firms may be used to investigate and summarise issues such as these into an overall narrative to be included in the Climate Risk Report.</p>

<p>90.	We propose that only the top-level figure for each Scope of emissions is required to be produced and reported by <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> in the Climate Risk Report.</p>

<h4>Paris alignment metric</h4>

<p>91.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s guidance recommends that financial institutions should describe the extent to which their activities are aligned with a well-below 2°C scenario (i.e. with the goals of the Paris agreement), which is consistent with net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
92.	We propose to introduce a requirement that the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should report a Paris Alignment Metric in line with the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s recommendation.</p>

<p>93.	Paris Alignment Metrics look at the future trajectory of emissions, whereas Total Carbon Emissions and Carbon Footprint only measure emissions which have already taken place. Forward-looking metrics such as Paris Alignment are more useful for active decision making than historic ones. They will be key to investors robustly assessing and reporting their portfolios’ alignment with their own climate goals and may help address exposure to transition risk. They are also useful for plotting trends over time.</p>

<p>94.	There are multiple ways to report Paris Alignment Metrics, which are explored in the Portfolio Alignment Team’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tcfdhub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PAT_Measuring_Portfolio_Alignment_Technical_Considerations.pdf" rel="external">Measuring portfolio alignment: Technical Considerations</a>, which was commissioned by the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>. This states that financial institutions should use whichever portfolio alignment tool best suits their institutional context and capabilities, and describes three main types of portfolio alignment metrics, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>binary target measurements: This tool measures the alignment of a portfolio with a given climate outcome based on the percentage of investments in that portfolio that either have declared net zero/Paris-alignment targets or are already net zero/Paris-aligned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>benchmark divergence models: These tools assess portfolio alignment by comparing the forecast emissions performance of investments or counterparties in the portfolio against benchmarks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>implied temperature rise (<abbr title="implied temperature rise">ITR</abbr>) models: these tools translate an assessment of alignment with a benchmark into a measure of the consequences of that alignment in the form of a temperature score.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>95.	These metrics are ambitious and if calculated reliably can create an extremely useful picture of a fund’s climate risks. <abbr title="implied temperature rise">ITR</abbr> in particular links a portfolio to a specific climate outcome in a way which is scientific, incentivises action and is comprehensible to the lay audience.</p>

<p>96.	The main problem with Paris Alignment Metrics is data, as in most cases only limited or approximate data is available. At best this means only a partial view is possible, and at worst it can create a false picture of the true exposure of a fund by over- or underestimating the metric.</p>

<p>97.	However we believe that an imperfect metric will still be useful. Calculating <abbr title="implied temperature rise">ITR</abbr> will be useful for funds to understand their carbon trajectories. Moreover, the more funds choose to calculate the <abbr title="implied temperature rise">ITR</abbr> the faster the data will improve.</p>

<p>98.	The <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> has a responsibility to its members, employers and the public, and the Government considers it important that publicly accessible data is accurate and as useful as possible. In addition, it is useful for funds to report consistently with each other and for the results to be possible to aggregate into an overall scheme view for the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>99.	We regard the Binary Target Measure to be the most appropriate for the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> at this point having taken these factors into account. It is simple to understand while still providing useful insights, and less subject to the data issues which exist for the other metrics. As data improves, the Government may change its approach to reflect this, and we encourage the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> and the sector to take a lead in promoting the most useful metrics.</p>

<p>100.	Therefore, we propose that all <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should report the percentage of their total assets with declared net zero or Paris-aligned targets. This is the Binary Target Measurement described above.</p>

<p>101.	We also encourage <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to calculate other Paris Alignment Metrics which they consider to be useful in managing their climate risks. We note that it is not only the commitment to net zero but also the pathway towards net zero which dictates Paris-alignment. For instance, a company may have made a net zero commitment, but still be making insufficient emissions reductions in the short term. For this reason, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should consider whether collecting and reporting an additional Paris Alignment Metric would be useful.</p>

<p>102.	We propose that only the top-level figure at the whole fund level is required to be produced and reported by <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Other metrics</h4>

<p>103.	We have proposed requirements for four metrics. However, we do not intend to limit the range of additional and more ambitious metrics <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> may select. The Government encourages <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to calculate other metrics which are endorsed by the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>, such as Climate Value at Risk (VAR)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>Guidance and regulation</h4>

<p>104.	We propose that the requirement to publish metrics is set out in regulations, but that the metrics themselves are defined in statutory guidance. This has the advantage that as metrics become more available and accurate over time, changes may be made to update the metrics without amending regulations.</p>

<h4>Summary of metrics proposals</h4>

<p>105.	We propose to require <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to calculate and report the following metrics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Metric 1 (absolute emissions metric) - Total Carbon Emissions, which includes the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reported separately, as well as the sum of the three.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metric 2 (emissions intensity metric) - Carbon Footprint. This is Carbon Emissions divided by the total assets of the fund to which the data relates. It should be calculated separately for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metric 3 (data quality metric) – the percentage of assets for which Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are verified, reported, estimated or unavailable, in line with the GHG Protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metric 4 (Paris Alignment Metric) – the percentage of the fund’s assets for which a public Paris aligned commitment has been made, i.e. net zero by 2050.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>106.	We also propose to recommend in statutory guidance that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> consider whether they wish to calculate any other climate related metrics recommended by the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> in order to inform assessment of climate risks.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 5: Do you agree with our proposed requirements in relation to metrics?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Targets</h3>

<p>107.	The <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommends that organisations set targets based on the metrics they select, including a target date, baseline and performance indicators, in order to focus efforts on managing climate risk.</p>

<p>108.	 The metrics proposed support <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to assess the current climate risks and opportunities to their assets. Targets will assist <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to take the next step to set their strategy for managing climate risks and opportunities to the fund and to measure their progress, as well as increasing accountability.</p>

<p>109.	We therefore propose that regulations require at least one target to be set either for one of the mandatory metrics listed above or another <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>-endorsed metric. This additional metric may be one of the more ambitious climate-related metrics, such as Climate VAR or Implied Temperature Rise, but must be limited to metrics endorsed by the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> or any of the mandatory metrics.</p>

<p>110.	We also propose that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should be required to measure and report performance against their targets annually, as far as they are able, as for the requirement on obtaining data.  This recognises that measuring and disclosing performance is dependent on data provided by others in the investment chain, in the same way as the requirement to obtain data for metrics. In order to ensure that targets are used and kept up to date, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will also be required to consider annually whether to continue with the target or replace it. We propose to provide statutory guidance to assist <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>111.	Our proposed requirements for <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must set a target for their fund in relation to one of the metrics which they have selected. The target may be in relation to one of the mandatory metrics (absolute emissions, emissions intensity, data quality or Paris alignment), or any other climate-related metric endorsed by the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> which the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> chooses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must annually measure, as far as they are able, the performance of their fund against the target they have set and taking into account that performance, determine whether the target should be retained or replaced.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>112.	There is no expectation that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should set targets which require them to divest or invest in a given way, and the targets are not legally binding.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 6: Do you agree with our proposed requirements in relation to targets?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>As far as able</h3>

<p>113.	We propose that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must carry out scenario analysis, obtain data, calculate, and use metrics and measure performance against <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>-set targets ‘as far as they are able’. This means that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> are expected to take all reasonable and proportionate steps given costs and time constraints. However, we recognise that there will inevitably be some gaps in the work produced, and while we would expect <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to do as much as they can we recognise that some elements are outside of their control. Therefore, where authorities are not able to comply with these proposals, they must include in their report both the areas and reasons where they are not able to comply in full.</p>

<p>114.	The requirement for <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to comply as far as they are able will enable them to produce metrics for only part of the portfolio or using estimation or incomplete data sets. This will still be decision-useful information for <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>. The urgency of climate change means that the <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> cannot wait until they have perfect data before they start putting it to use.</p>

<h3>Ongoing and annual duties</h3>

<p>115.	We distinguish between ongoing and discrete duties. For duties which are regular discrete events such as reporting, we have proposed specific time intervals for <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to follow. Ongoing duties on the other hand are those which do not take place as a distinct event but a continuous requirement. For example, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should always be managing the risks of the fund, and so we would think of risk management as an ongoing requirement. In practice, we recognise that these requirements will be considered at regular intervals as well, but the requirement itself would be ongoing.</p>

<p>116.	All duties are ongoing, except requirements to conduct scenario analysis, calculate metrics, and set and review performance against targets.</p>

<p>117.	Scenario analysis must be carried out in the reporting year 2023/24 and at least every three years thereafter. In the intervening years, <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should review whether circumstances have changed enough to refresh their analysis. This decision should take account of availability of data, or a significant change in investment or funding strategy. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should explain in their Climate Risk Report whether they have carried out a new analysis, and if not give a short explanation as to why.</p>

<p>118.	Underlying data for metrics and targets must be obtained, the metrics calculated, and performance against targets measured, at least annually.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Reporting on climate risks</h2>

<p>119.	 High quality reporting on climate risks is central to the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s recommendations. The aim is to enable stakeholders to understand as fully as possible their climate exposures and the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s approach to addressing those risks, in the short, medium and long term. Transparency will also enable users of the reports to measure and monitor current performance against targets and the planned trajectory and to assess the implications for future performance.</p>

<p>120.	To achieve these aims in the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>, reporting will need to be clear, comprehensive and consistent, as well as timely, verifiable and comparable across the sector, in line with the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>’s principles for effective disclosure<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. This chapter sets out our proposals ensuring that reporting both at <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> and at scheme level meets these standards, and delivers proper accountability to members, locally and across the scheme.</p>

<h3>Annual climate risk report</h3>

<p>121.	We propose that each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> publishes a Climate Risk Report every year, at the same time as the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s annual report is published – i.e. 1 December for the reporting year which ended the previous 31 March. Once published, the Climate Risk Report must be easily and freely accessible online and members must be informed of where to find it. In addition, links to each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s Climate Risk Report will be included in the Scheme Climate Report and may be shown on the Scheme Advisory Board’s (<abbr title="Scheme Advisory Board">SAB</abbr>) website. The Climate Risk Report may be a constituent part of the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s Annual Report, or a standalone report.</p>

<p>122.	This means that the first report for the year 2023/24 must be available by 1 December 2024.</p>

<p>123.	The Climate Risk Report should be accessible to two distinct types of user: specialist and non-specialist. The Climate Risk Report will contain detailed and useful data, and we hope that the metrics, targets and scenario analysis in particular will be important resources for specialist audiences. This role of the Climate Risk Report may require it to be technical in content, and dense with information.</p>

<p>124.	In addition, various non-specialist stakeholders including scheme members, members of the public and other parties will also need to be considered. The Climate Risk Report should include enough information to be understood by the lay reader.</p>

<p>125.	The <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> will have to decide on how best to approach these dual requirements. One approach is to split the Climate Risk Report into two sections: a body and a short executive summary. The executive summary would be written to explain the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s approach and high-level findings to the lay reader. This allows the body of the Climate Risk Report to be technical as is useful to specialist audiences. We regard this as a very effective way to address this balance, although other approaches would also be valid.</p>

<p>126.	We would like to stress that the narrative provided in the Climate Risk Report will be as valuable as the data for most audiences. Metrics by themselves are difficult to interpret for the lay reader.</p>

<p>127.	For example, differences in an <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s investment allocation, such as its strategic allocations between the main asset types will affect its carbon emissions. Moreover, a high carbon exposure or poor alignment with the Paris climate goals may be managed by effective stewardship and engagement from the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should ensure that messages such as these are presented in a way to help the lay reader interpret the report and understand the fund’s strategy towards managing the risks from climate change.</p>

<p>128.	It is important that the report must be easily accessible to scheme members, on the <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s website and via an internet search. We propose that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must at least inform members of the Climate Risk Report and how to find it when they issue their annual benefit statements. This does not necessarily mean including wording in the annual benefit statement itself.</p>

<p>129.	Climate Risk Reports should be produced in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-government-transparency-code-2015/local-government-transparency-code-2015">Local government transparency code 2015</a>.</p>

<p>130.	We propose that the Climate Risk Report must include the following information:</p>

<p><strong>Question 7: Do you agree with our approach to reporting?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Scheme climate risk report</h3>

<p>131.	In addition to the Climate Risk Reports published by each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>, we are proposing an annual Scheme Climate Risk Report to provide an overview of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> and climate risks, produced by the Scheme Advisory Board (<abbr title="Scheme Advisory Board">SAB</abbr>). Such an overview would be useful for scheme members and other stakeholders. It would also enable the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> to demonstrate progress and impact, and showcase good practice.</p>

<p>132.	We therefore propose as a minimum that the Scheme Climate Risk Report would include links to each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr>’s Climate Risk Report and the four aggregated metrics for the whole <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>133.	In relation to metrics, we propose that Total Carbon Emissions and Carbon Footprint should be calculated and reported at an aggregate level. This would involve a simple sum of Total Carbon Emissions for Aggregate Total Carbon Emissions. In order to calculate Aggregate Carbon Footprint, this would be calculated as Aggregate Total Carbon Emissions divided by the overall size of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> investment portfolio for which total emissions are at least estimated. This would be done separately for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.</p>

<p>134.	When reporting the data quality metric, each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> must report the proportion of its assets for which overall emissions data is: Verified, Reported, Estimated or Unavailable. One reason that we have proposed this metric is that it can be aggregated across <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>. As risk management is a key objective of <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> reporting, we believe that visibility of data quality, which is essential to the understanding of risk, will be a useful way to measure progress. Therefore, we propose to show overall data quality in the Scheme Climate Report, whereby the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>’s entire assets will be divided into verified, reported, estimated and unknown.</p>

<p>135.	We propose that the <abbr title="Scheme Advisory Board">SAB</abbr> reports on an aggregate Paris Alignment Metric based on <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> level reports. This would show the proportion of the value of the whole <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>’s assets for which there is a net zero commitment in line with the Paris goals.</p>

<p>136.	In the above paragraphs we have outlined our minimum proposals for the Scheme Climate Risk Report. In addition, we are inviting views about whether emissions, data quality and Paris-alignment metrics for each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> should be shown in the Scheme Climate Risk Report.</p>

<p>137.	Emissions and data quality metrics will already be available in the Climate Risk Reports published by each <abbr title="administering authority">AA</abbr> and it will be possible to make comparisons between <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> may be concerned about being compared unfairly, and may fear that this may lead to pressure to reduce emissions through divestment. There is no expectation from Government that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> should reduce emissions via divestment.</p>

<p>138.	We recognise that transparency is an important feature of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>’s approach to managing climate risks. It is important for all those to whom the Scheme is accountable have easy access to climate-related information.</p>

<p>139.	We do not propose to include any aggregate data on the scenario analysis requirement. This is because scenario analysis may be very difficult to aggregate in a meaningful way.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 8: Do you agree with our proposals on the Scheme Climate Risk Report?</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Other issues</h2>

<p>140.	This chapter deals with a number of other issues relevant to the implementation of the <abbr title="Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations in the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>The role of the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> asset pools</h3>

<p>141.	Since 2015, 8 <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> pools have been set up with the aim of securing the benefits of scale including more professional management, reduced investment costs, increased net returns, improved resilience, and access to a wider range of assets, including infrastructure.  Many of the pools have developed significant capabilities in relation to climate risks and responsible investment more broadly.</p>

<p>142.	As of March 2021 around 80% of the Scheme’s assets are either pooled, in a transition plan to be pooled, or have some oversight by their pool, although the proportion varies widely across <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> and across pools. For pooled assets, we expect that the pools will be able to provide data, calculate metrics and carry out scenario analysis on these assets where that data is available. There are differing views on the extent to which pools will be able to deliver these services for assets that are not held by the pool, especially where there are already contracts with data providers in place. Some pools will already be able to provide advice on data, metrics and scenario analysis and other relevant issues or will wish to develop or jointly commission such advice.</p>

<p>143.	In this landscape there is potential for a multiplicity of different analyses and reports to be required on the same <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> assets. Pool operators are required to report on climate risks in relation to pooled assets by the Financial Conduct Authority. If <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>’ strategies significantly differ it will be resource intensive for their pool to produce analysis for them.</p>

<p>144.	We expect to see this issue reduce in importance over time as more assets transition into the pools. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> which have transferred close to 100% of their assets excluding cash to their pools would be able to use the analyses conducted by their pool for their own purposes. <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> could also minimise this issue by aligning their strategies and targets within their pool and ensuring as shareholders that the pool’s strategy also aligns with that of the partner <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr>. This would enable <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to commission their pool to conduct analyses for both pooled and non-pooled assets on a consistent basis with the pool’s own reporting. Both completing transition and aligning strategies would also have significant wider benefits for costs and performance through delivering greater scale.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 9: Do you have any comments on the role of the LGPS asset pools in delivering the requirements?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Guidance and reporting template for administering authorities</h3>

<p>145.	DLUHC intends to provide high level statutory guidance to accompany changes to regulations. This will include guidance relating to the governance activities required of <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> and the Climate Risk Report. We have also asked the <abbr title="Scheme Advisory Board">SAB</abbr> to produce more detailed operational guidance.</p>

<p>146.	The <abbr title="Scheme Advisory Board">SAB</abbr> will also be asked to produce a standard template which <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will be required to follow in producing their Climate Risk Report. This will help <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> to comply with the requirements, and help to ensure that the Scheme Climate Risk Report is as comprehensive and consistent as possible.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 10: Do you have any comments on our proposed approach to guidance?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Knowledge, skills and advice</h3>

<p>147.	It is important that individuals making decisions in response to climate-risk management processes have the adequate skills and information to make choices. While we will not be imposing any legal requirement on an individual’s knowledge and skills, we wish to promote best practice in our approach. It is important to note that scheme managers are not expected to be technical experts in climate science or climate finance. However, a base knowledge regarding climate risks will be necessary in order to, for example, interpret the results of scenario analysis.</p>

<p>148.	Firstly, we propose to require that <abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> must take proper advice regarding assessing and managing climate risks. This should help the scheme manager, who may not be a technical expert to take proper account of climate risks in setting their investment strategy and asset allocation.</p>

<p>149.	<abbr title="administering authorities">AAs</abbr> will need to satisfy themselves that the advice is high quality and provided by appropriately qualified people. We welcome views as to how this may be practically ensured. We welcome responses on whether and how pools could jointly procure expert advice for their partner funds.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 11: Do you have any comments on our proposed approach to knowledge, skills and advice?</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Consideration of impact on protected groups</h3>

<p>150.	Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 requires Government to have due regard to the potential impact of new decisions, policies or policy changes on particular groups with protected characteristics and to avoid disproportionate negative impacts (the public sector equality duty).</p>

<p>151.	We have made an initial assessment under the duty and do not believe there would be impacts on protected groups from the proposals in this consultation, as they do not affect member contributions or benefits. We have considered whether the reporting requirements could give rise to negative impacts on certain groups with protected characteristics and believe they would not. However, administering authorities and the Scheme Advisory Board are also subject to the public sector equality duty and we would expect them to take steps to ensure compliance with the duty, including that their reports under these proposals are available in accessible formats.</p>
