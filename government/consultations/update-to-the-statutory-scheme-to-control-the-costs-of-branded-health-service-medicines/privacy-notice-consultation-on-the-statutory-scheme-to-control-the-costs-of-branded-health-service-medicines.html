<h3>Summary of initiative or policy</h3>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DSHC) (the Department) proposes to update the payment percentages in the statutory scheme for branded medicine pricing (known as the ‘statutory scheme’).</p>

<h3>Data controller</h3>

<p>DHSC is the data controller.</p>

<h3>What personal data we collect</h3>

<p>We will be collecting information in relation to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the capacity in which you are responding to the survey, that is if you are sharing your personal views and experiences, your professional views and experiences, or responding on behalf of an organisation</li>
  <li>if you are responding as an individual, we will collect information on protected characteristics (such as age, sex, ethnicity, disability status) should you elect to provide this information. It will not be mandatory for individuals to provide this information in order to respond to the policy questions in the consultation</li>
  <li>if you are responding as an individual and sharing your professional views and experience, we will collect information on what sector you work in (the NHS, elsewhere in the public sector, private or voluntary sector and so on). It will not be mandatory for individuals to provide this information in order to respond to the policy questions in the consultation</li>
  <li>alternatively, if you are responding on behalf of an organisation, we collect information on the type of the organisation you are responding on behalf of (for example whether it is a pharmaceuticals company who is a member of either branded medicine pricing scheme, sector representative organisation, charity, NHS organisation and so on)</li>
  <li>whether you would like to receive information on other consultations carried out by&nbsp;the department</li>
  <li>your email address – it will not be mandatory to provide this information in order to respond to the policy questions in the consultation</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we use your data (purposes)</h3>

<p>We will collect personal information via the survey for the consultation. If you write or email us directly then we will collect your personal information via this channel.</p>

<p>We need to hold your information to understand in what capacity you are responding as this is crucial in our analysis of how our proposals will affect different individuals and organisations.</p>

<p>We ask you to provide your email address for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for verification purposes if you need to contact us about amending or deleting your response</li>
  <li>to contact you if our policy team have a follow-up question to ask</li>
</ul>

<p>We ask you to provide information about your protected characteristics so that we can understand the range of individuals represented in the response to the consultation, as we would like to ensure that a broad cross section of the population is included in the consultation.</p>

<h3>Legal basis for processing personal data</h3>

<p>Under Article 6 of the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) we rely on your consent as the lawful basis for processing this information.</p>

<p>Under Article 9 of the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) we rely on your consent as the lawful basis for processing special category data (including data relating to an individual’s ethnicity and health data).</p>

<h3>Data processors and other recipients of personal data</h3>

<p>Personal data will only be shared internally within&nbsp;the department&nbsp;with employees involved in this consultation.</p>

<h3>International data transfers and storage location(s)</h3>

<p>All data is stored on&nbsp;DHSC&nbsp;secured platforms.</p>

<h3>Retention and disposal policy</h3>

<p>We will keep your information for one year and then will dispose of it from the department’s&nbsp;secured platform.</p>

<h3>How we keep your data secure</h3>

<p>All data is stored on a secure&nbsp;platform and only people involved in the consultation will have access to this.</p>

<h3>Your rights as a data subject</h3>

<p>By law, data subjects have a number of rights and this processing does not take away or reduce these rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 applies.</p>

<p>These rights are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the right to get copies of information – individuals have the right to ask for a copy of any information about them that is used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right to get information corrected – individuals have the right to ask for any information held about them that they think is inaccurate, to be corrected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right to limit how the information is used – individuals have the right to ask for any of the information held about them to be restricted, for example, if they think inaccurate information is being used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right to object to the information being used – individuals can ask for any information held about them to not be used. However, this is not an absolute right, and continued use of the information may be necessary, with individuals being advised if this is the case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right to get information deleted – this is not an absolute right, and continued use of the information may be necessary, with individuals being advised if this is the case</p>
  </li>
</ul>
