<h2>Background</h2>

<p>12. The Pension Protection Fund (<abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr>) was established by the Pensions Act 2004 in order to protect members of eligible defined benefit occupational pension schemes and the defined benefit element of hybrid schemes. The <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> will pay compensation where an employer has a qualifying insolvency event and there are insufficient assets in the scheme to pay benefits at <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> compensation levels.</p>

<p>13. The <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPFâs</abbr> responsibilities under the Act include the operation of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>. The <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> provides compensation to occupational pension schemes where there has been scheme asset reduction, which is attributable to an offence involving dishonesty, and where the employer has become insolvent or is unlikely to continue as a going concern. This includes both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> recovers from eligible occupational pension schemes the costs of compensation paid from the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>.</p>

<p>14. Amendments to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Fraud Compensation Levy) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 558), (âthe <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> regulationsâ) are required to allow the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> ceiling to be raised.</p>

<p>15. In November 2020, the High Court (in The Board of the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> v Dalriada Trustees Ltd<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>), clarified that pension liberation schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> , if they satisfied specified criteria, were eligible to make a claim on the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>.</p>

<p>16. There are insufficient assets within the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> to meet claims arising from that judgment in the short term. The Compensation (London Capital &amp; Finance plc and Fraud Compensation Fund) Act 2021 received Royal Assent on 20 October 2021. This Act, in so far as it affects the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>, provides the Secretary of State with a power to make a loan to the Board of the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr>. The <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr>, acting in its capacity as manager of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>, will use the loan, along with any assets in the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>, to meet these potential claims. Consultees may wish to note that the Act does not change, and was not intended to change, the structure of either the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> or the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr>. The loan will be repaid via the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr>.</p>

<p>17. Regulation 3(3)(b) of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> regulations specifies the maximum levy that may be imposed on eligible pension schemes. It is currently Â£0.75 per member. The government proposes to increase this ceiling, so that the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> rate for such schemes can be set by the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> at an appropriate level.</p>

<p>18. Regulation 3A of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> regulations, inserted by the Occupational Pension Schemes (Master Trusts) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018 No. 1030), (âthe Master Trust regulationsâ) introduced a lower maximum levy (Â£0.30 per member) applicable to Master Trusts. The government proposes that the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> ceiling for Master Trusts will be lower than other occupational schemes.</p>

<p>19. The amendments proposed above will allow the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> the ability to set the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> at levels that will enable it to repay the loan provided by the government by 2030 to 2031. The government considers this period a reasonable one over which to effect recovery. The loan is expected to cover 122 schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and amounts to approximately Â£250m over the period from 2021 to 2025. Paragraphs 25 to 29 provide further information.</p>

<p>20. A number of suggestions have been made by commentators about how the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> might be adapted in the future. Paragraphs 21 to 24 set out the governmentâs position on some of these suggestions.</p>

<p>21. One suggestion is that schemes that maintain robust governance systems, and are therefore unlikely to call on the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>, should be exempt from payment of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr>. There is a widely accepted principle that the pensions industry should meet the costs of protecting the pensions sector, rather than spreading the costs to all taxpayers, who do not all benefit from the provision of occupational pensions. Although the government believes that the risk of future frauds has been reduced, it is unrealistic to believe the risk has been completely eliminated. It follows that all occupational pension schemes, however well-governed, derive benefit from the existence of robust fraud compensation arrangements, which increase the level of consumer confidence in pension saving. Furthermore, a shift in the burden of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> to the taxpayer could disincentivise pension schemes from taking thorough precautions against fraud and dishonesty, in the expectation that any future <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> deficit would not lead to an additional cost on eligible schemes. For these reasons, the government intends to maintain a system whereby the costs of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> are met by occupational pension schemes through the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr>.</p>

<p>22. Another suggestion is that the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> should be restructured, so that it is no longer based on the number of members in each occupational pension scheme. This suggestion is often made on the basis that Master Trusts with large numbers of members, or small pots, or both, are disadvantaged by the current member-based structure. The aim has been to set the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> ceiling at a substantially lower level for Master Trusts than other schemes to reflect their particular characteristics. There are no plans to alter this arrangement, which is expected to mean that the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> burden to be absorbed by Master Trusts is substantially lower than the burden to be absorbed by most other schemes. The Impacts section provides further information.</p>

<p>23. Some commentators have called for a fundamental review of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr>, in the light of the increased fiscal demands that the Dalriada judgment will place on the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>. The government believes that the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> and <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> continue to work broadly as intended. Consequently, it has no plans for a fundamental review in this area. The government will give further consideration to this possibility over the medium term, alongside ongoing monitoring of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> ceiling.</p>

<p>24. The government is also aware of a suggestion that it is unfair for schemes that did not exist at the time when the pensions liberation fraud was perpetrated to share the burden of higher levy costs following the Dalriada judgment. The design of the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> is such that it will always be the case that some occupational pension schemes will come into existence, and therefore be liable for the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr>, after a fraud eligible for compensation has come to light, particularly given the length of time that can elapse before a fraud is confirmed. Exempting such schemes from the requirement to contribute to the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> would add complexity to what is intended to be a levy system that is simple to understand and operate. It would also mean that a smaller number of occupational pension schemes would need to shoulder the cost burden of addressing historic frauds. Finally, it would mean that the robustness of the fraud compensation arrangements, from which all schemes derive benefit, would be diminished by limiting coverage. The government does not believe that these outcomes could be justified.</p>

<h2>Proposed change</h2>

<p>25. This section sets out the governmentâs proposal for adjusting the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> ceiling for 2022 to 2023 and onwards. This will allow the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> rates to be reset, at levels that will enable the loan the government intends to make to the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> to be repaid by 2030 to 2031.</p>

<p>26. This proposed change would mean that the loan to facilitate the higher level of expenditure from the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr>, projected for the period to 2025 would be repaid by 2030 to 2031. The government believes that this would strike an appropriate balance between recovery over a period that is not unduly lengthy and limiting the impact on pension schemes.</p>

<p>27. The <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> levy ceiling under the proposed change would provide for levy rates to be set by the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> not exceeding Â£0.65 per member for Master Trusts and Â£1.80 per member for other eligible occupational schemes. For illustrative purposes the draft regulations are annexed.</p>

<p>28. The effect on revenue and the impact of the proposed change as set against the baseline is explained in the impacts section below.</p>

<p>29. The government does not believe that preserving the current levy ceiling is a realistic option and so it is not consulting on such a possibility. No change would mean that the levy rates set by the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> would be limited to the current levy ceiling. The result would be that the higher level of expenditure enabled by the loan described in paragraph 16 above would not be recovered in full until approximately the 2040s. This would be an unreasonable length of time for the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> to be in deficit and would be contrary to the tenets of government accounting. Although the government is not consulting on a âno changeâ option, it is including information about the current position in the impacts section below to facilitate a baseline comparison with its proposal.  <br>
Impacts</p>

<p>30. The government has considered the impacts of its proposed change on employers, pension schemes and members.</p>

<p>31.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> estimates that if the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Levy">FCL</abbr> rates were to remain unchanged, the <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> would be in a deficit position exceeding Â£250m by 2025. The proposed change sees a substantial increase in levy revenue, alongside a loan to provide short to medium term financing to cover <abbr title="Fraud Compensation Fund">FCF</abbr> expenditure. The aim is to recover the loan of approximately Â£250m and eliminate the levy deficit by 2030 to 2031.</p>

<p>32. The aggregate additional impact has been calculated by comparing the proposal to the current position.</p>

<p>33. The following table sets out expected revenue for the years 2021 to 2031 at the current rates charged by the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> (Â£0.30 per member for Master Trusts and Â£0.75 per member for all other occupational pension schemes).</p>

<h3>Explanatory note</h3>

<p>(This note is not part of the Regulations)</p>

<p>These Regulations make amendments to two Statutory Instruments: SI 2006/558 the Occupational Pension Schemes (Fraud Compensation Levy) Regulations 2006 and SI 2018/1030 the Occupational Pension Schemes (Master Trusts) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>Regulation 3 amends SI 2006/558 to set out the maximum fraud compensation levy that may be raised in any one financial year.  It sets a maximum fraud compensation levy for authorised Master Trusts of 65 pence per member and increases the maximum fraud compensation levy from 75 pence to Â£1:80 per member, for all other occupational pension schemes.</p>

<p>Regulation 4 removes Regulation 23(2)(c) from SI 2018/1030 the Occupational Pension Schemes (Master Trusts) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>The fraud compensation levy is paid by all occupational pension schemes and is used to fund the Fraud Compensation Fund, which makes payments to certain schemes that have lost money due to fraud. 
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as it amends an existing statutory levy regime and has a negligible impact on civil society organisations or the private sector.</p>
