<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) is conducting a review on the emerging trends and tax implications of hybrid and distance working.</p>

<p>The review is looking at changes in practice and emerging trends. In the context of hybrid and distance/home working, we are therefore concerned with situations where this is a change for the business. An example might be a small business that was previously based in an office, but after successfully working remotely during the pandemic has chosen to let the office go and allow their staff to work from home. For the purposes of this review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hybrid working</strong> is where the terms of engagement require workers to spend some of their contracted hours in their employer’s workspace but allow flexibility for where they work the remainder of their contracted hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Distance/home working</strong> is where the terms of engagement allow a worker to perform their duties in an agreed location of their choosing (usually their home). With distance/home working, either there is no requirement to work from an employer’s workspace, or no employer workspace is available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to overseas travel, this review is not looking at traditional expatriate assignments where individuals moved to a different country to work for a set period. It is instead focusing on more recent trends that have arisen due to changes in how people are able to work.</p>

<p>This is planned to be a high-level evidential review of the current extent of hybrid and distance/home working, whether it is likely to increase, whether this trend involves more working across borders, and whether changes in working practices give rise to any tax complexity or challenges for employers and employees, as well as small businesses. We will consider income tax, social security, employee/self-employed expenses and allowances, and potential corporate residence and permanent establishment (taxable presence) implications for companies.</p>

<p>We welcome discussions and submissions on this subject. The main focus of the review will consider the trends in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>employees of UK companies working overseas (not on formal expatriate assignments),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employees of overseas employers working in the UK (not on formal expatriate assignments),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hybrid and distance/home working within the UK, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impacts on practices of the self-employed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-hybrid-and-distance-working-scoping-document">Scoping Note</a> for this review is available on GOV.UK: Review of hybrid and distance working scoping document.</p>

<h2>Consultation Questions</h2>

<p>The OTS welcomes responses to all or any of the questions below, as well as any general or specific comments on the areas covered by this review. There is no requirement to respond to all the questions; responses focusing on a particular area or question are equally welcome.</p>
