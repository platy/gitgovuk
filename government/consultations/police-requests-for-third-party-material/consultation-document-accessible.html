<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>The government is committed to ensuring that victims of crime are treated fairly and respectfully, and that investigations are progressed swiftly to ensure that offenders are brought to justice.</p>

<p>Police requests for third party material, which can include education, medical or local authority records are sometimes necessary to further an investigation, but are not always dealt with appropriately. Sometimes requests are made for too much or unnecessary information, and this can make the victim feel like they are the one under investigation. This can be especially challenging for victims of rape and sexual assault where the material requested is often very sensitive. The length of investigations can also be traumatic for victims, and requests for third party material can contribute to slowing them down.</p>

<p>When someone reports a crime, they should feel confident that they can do so in the knowledge that their privacy will not be unnecessarily invaded, and that their case will not face lengthy delays as a result of such requests.</p>

<p>Through this consultation we want to gather more insight, evidence and data to gain a thorough understanding of the issues. We are also using the consultation to evaluate potential new duties on policing, which would be designed to ensure that police requests for third party material are made appropriately.</p>

<p>I welcome views on these issues and look forward to further discussion with stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Rachel Maclean MP</strong></p>

<p><strong>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Minister for Safeguarding)</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this consultation is to gather information about law enforcement requests for third party material relating to victims of crime, and to test potential options for improving this process. Third party material is material held by a person, organisation, or government department other than the investigator and prosecutor, either within the UK or outside the UK. Third parties are not directly involved in the case in question, but may hold information relevant to it<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. This might include medical, educational, or social service records but can encompass a broad range of material such as employment records or notes from counselling sessions.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary for police to request material from a third party about a victim where it is relevant to a reasonable line of enquiry. Where police make such a request, they must have a lawful basis to do so and ensure compliance with the wider legislative obligations (such as the Human Rights Act 1998, the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK GDPR). While the issues being explored in this consultation are especially relevant to rape and sexual offence (RASO) investigations, third party material can be relevant in a range of crime types, so the responses to and outcome of the consultation could have a broad impact.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/end-to-end-rape-review-report-on-findings-and-actions">government’s end-to-end rape review</a> highlighted a number of issues related to third party material, which our policy proposals seek to address. A primary issue is the necessity and proportionality of requests, meaning that police sometimes request too much information about a victim or that they might request information that isn’t relevant. Requests might come directly from the police or may originate from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Participants in research conducted as part of the Rape Review reported an increase in requests for third party material in recent years, making an already distressing process feel even more intrusive.</p>

<p>There is a concern that information requested about victims in RASO cases may be used to try to prove or disprove the victim’s credibility using information that is not relevant to the investigation. For example, historic educational records from before the time when the alleged offence took place. This can have a severe negative effect on the victim. Such an approach might unnecessarily invade their privacy, make them feel like they are the ones under investigation and may be a significant factor that causes them to withdraw from the criminal justice process</p>

<p>Initial scoping work with police forces, victim groups and third parties has identified an inconsistent approach to what, and how, victims are informed in relation to third party material requests. The legal basis relied upon, the precise information required and how the material will be used are particular areas of concern.</p>

<p>While the existing legal framework requires the police to act in a way which appropriately respects individuals’ privacy, we consider there is merit in considering whether additional legislative and non-legislative measures could help to address the inconsistent approaches being adopted. We are considering a number of proposals to address these issues. The duties we are seeking input on are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statutory duty on policing to seek third party material only when necessary and proportionate</li>
  <li>a statutory duty on policing to provide full and clear information to both the person about whom the third party material is being requested and the third party who is being asked to provide the information</li>
  <li>a code of practice to accompany these duties and clarify their use in practice</li>
</ul>

<p>A further issue is the amount of time it takes for third parties to return requests for material, and the impact this can have on slowing down a case. As part of this consultation, we are interested to find out more about whether or not this is a significant factor in elongating investigation timeframes, why third parties might struggle to return material quickly, and whether by ensuring requests are only made where necessary and proportionate this will have a positive effect on timeliness. Lengthy investigations are traumatic to victims, especially in relation to RASO. If requests for third party material are causing significant delays, this is also something we want to address.</p>

<p>We invite responses to this consultation from all those who are involved in police investigations that include requests for third party material, especially in RASO cases as this was identified as a particular issue in the Rape Review. This includes policing organisations, CPS prosecutors, criminal justice representatives including judges and defence lawyers, civil society organisations representing victims of rape and sexual assault, victims of crime who have had third party material requested about them, third party organisations that may be asked to supply material about victims such as local authorities, education and health organisations, Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs) and Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs).</p>
