<h2>Topic of this call for evidence</h2>

<p>Following consultation, government announced at COP26 in November 2021 that it will phase out the sale of new, non-zero emission heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) less than or equal to 26 tonnes from 2035. From 2040 all new HGVs sold in the UK must be zero emission.</p>

<p>This call for evidence seeks views on whether any HGVs less than or equal to 26 tonnes should be exempt from the 2035 phase-out date for the sale of new non-zero emission HGVs. These vehicles would still be subject to the 2040 end of sales date, when all new road vehicles sold in the UK must be zero emission.</p>

<p>This call for evidence should be considered in the context of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/heavy-goods-vehicles-ending-the-sale-of-new-non-zero-emission-models">consultation on proposed phase out dates for the sale of new, non-zero emission HGVs and the written outcome and response</a>.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The announced HGV phase-out dates will apply to the sale of new, non-zero emission vehicles in vehicle categories N2 and N3 as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2018/858/article/4" rel="external">Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2018/858</a>, as it applies in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The phase-out dates will not apply to the sale of new:</p>

<ul>
  <li>off-road vehicles (categories N2G and N3G)</li>
  <li>buses and coaches</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R1628&amp;from=LV" rel="external">non-road mobile machinery</a> (<abbr title="non-road mobile machinery">NRMM</abbr>)</li>
  <li>vehicles exempt from road vehicle type approval, such as vehicles with <abbr title="non-road mobile machinery">NRMM</abbr> engines, military vehicles and fire engines</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0858" rel="external">special purpose vehicles</a></li>
  <li>agricultural equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2035 phase out date will apply to rigid vehicles with a gross vehicle weight less than or equal to 26 tonnes, and any articulated HGVs with a gross combination weight of 26 tonnes and under.</p>

<p>A zero emission vehicle is a vehicle that does not produce harmful exhaust emissions, such as greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions. Exhaust emissions which do not damage public health, such as water vapour, are permitted.</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>

<p>This technical call for evidence will run from 12 May to 22 July 2022.</p>

<h2>How to respond</h2>

<p>Please respond to this call for evidence using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/IICPNZ" rel="external">online survey</a>. This helps our analysis of the responses and enables a more efficient and effective consideration of the issues raised.</p>

HGV phase out date exemptions consultation
<br>Great Minister House 
<br>33 Horseferry Road London 
<br>SW1P 4DR 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h2>Policy background</h2>

<p>The transition to zero emission HGVs is different to that for cars and vans. The HGV sector is diverse, with a range of daily drive cycles, use cases and refuelling patterns. Vehicles are purchased to provide specific services and need to be efficient, reliable and competitive on a total cost of ownership basis to fulfil their commercial functions. HGVs are in regular use over their lifetime, often travelling long distances and carrying heavy loads.</p>

<p>In recognition of the complexity of HGV use cases government will phase out the sale of new, non-zero emission HGVs in 2 stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a phase out date for the sale of new, non-zero emission HGVs less than or equal to 26 tonnes will be introduced from 2035</li>
  <li>from 2040 all new HGVs sold in the UK must be zero emission</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we are seeking evidence on</h2>

<p>We are now seeking evidence on HGVs or HGV use cases that justify being included within a limited range of exemptions to the 2035 phase out date for new, non-zero emission HGVs weighing 26 tonnes and under. These vehicles may need until 2040 to transition to zero emission technologies. For example they may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry heavy or abnormal loads</li>
  <li>have an additional power draw</li>
  <li>spend most of their time operating in specialist or remote areas</li>
  <li>be used in long-haul applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>This is an overview of the questions we are asking in the call for evidence.</p>

<p>The easiest way to respond to the questions is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/IICPNZ" rel="external">via the online questionnaire</a>.</p>

<p>1) Do you agree or disagree there should be exemptions to the 2035 phase out date for the sale of new, non-zero emission HGVs less than or equal to 26 tonnes?</p>

<p>2) If you disagree, explain why you think we should not allow exemptions to the 2035 end of sales date.</p>

<p>3) If you agree, explain which HGVs or HGV use cases should be exempt from the 2035 phase out date for the sale of new, non-zero emission HGVs 26 tonnes and under.</p>

<p>Please provide clear reasoning for why each vehicle or use case should be exempt.</p>

<p>Where possible, your answer should include information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vehicle use case</li>
  <li>vehicle category (N2 or N3)</li>
  <li>gross vehicle or gross combination weight</li>
  <li>chassis configuration</li>
  <li>duty cycle</li>
  <li>typical operating hours</li>
  <li>power requirements</li>
  <li>trailer type</li>
</ul>

<p>It should explain how long the exemption should apply for and why, noting a maximum exemption length of 5 years.</p>

<p>You should provide any data, evidence or estimates of the number of vehicles this exemption could apply to.</p>

<p>4) What are the risks were government not to introduce exemptions for these vehicles?</p>

<p>5) Are there any key sources of information or data government should consider when seeking to apply possible exemptions?</p>

<p>6) Are there any circumstances in which you can see the exemptions you’ve recommended becoming redundant?</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The information collected through this call for evidence, together with information gathered during the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/heavy-goods-vehicles-ending-the-sale-of-new-non-zero-emission-models">HGV phase out date consultation</a>, is the first step in a process which will eventually see the end of sale dates for new, non-zero emission HGVs enforced through regulation. Further consultation on what this future regulation may look like and how it may impact the sector will take place in due course.</p>
