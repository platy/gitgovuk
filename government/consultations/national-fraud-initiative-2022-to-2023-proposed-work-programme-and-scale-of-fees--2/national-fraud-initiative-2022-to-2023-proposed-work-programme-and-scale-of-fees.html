<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This consultation sets out the Cabinet Office proposals for the National Fraud Initiative (<abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>) 2022/23 work programme and the associated scale of fees. The consultation is undertaken to fulfil the requirements of statutory data matching powers set out in Part 6 and Schedule 9 to the Local Audit and Accountability Act (<abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr>) 2014, which states that the Minister for the Cabinet Office must prescribe and consult on a scale of fees for mandatory data matching exercises.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this consultation is to seek your views on the proposed fee scale for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to collate feedback on the proposed dataset requirements for mandatory participants.</p>

<p>When reading the proposals outlined in this document in relation to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme, it is recommended that you consider and comment on proposals to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove social care datasets from the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme for relevant organisations</li>
  <li>continue to mandate data, where appropriate, relevant to the coronavirus (COVID-19) grant relief programme (councils only)</li>
  <li>mandate the submission of data to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> from Integrated Care Boards (<abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr>) in place of Clinical Commissioning Groups (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>), in line with the reforms set out in Health and Care Bill 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>When reading the proposals outlined in this document in relation to prescribed fees, it is recommended that you consider and comment on proposals to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue with the existing fee model which determines a fee scale for organisations that participate in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>, based on the number of datasets submitted and the volume of high risk <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> matches received by participants</li>
  <li>adjust fees for relevant organisations to account for the removal of social care datasets from the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme</li>
  <li>uplift fees in line with the average annual inflation rate of 1.75% per annum, for the period 2019 to 2021</li>
  <li>continue with the existing policy to levy a 5% penalty fee where participants fail to comply with <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data submission requirements as determined by the Cabinet Office</li>
</ul>

<p>The Cabinet Office will review all consultation feedback and publish a summary and formal response on GOV.UK. Should the consultation feedback result in any revisions to the proposals set out in this document, these will apply to the final <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme and fees.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> is a data matching exercise that helps to detect and prevent fraud. It is conducted by the Cabinet Office under its statutory data matching powers set out in the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> is an important part of the Government Counter Fraud Function (<abbr title="Government Counter Fraud Function">GCFF</abbr>) Centre of Expertise, helping to build the fraud detection capabilities of public bodies through sharing and matching data at a national level. By providing data and analytics services, the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> helps to deliver one of the <abbr title="Government Counter Fraud Function">GCFF</abbr>âs strategic objectives to innovate in intelligence and use of data, to increase the detection and prevention of fraud loss across the public sector.</p>

<p>Fraud is the most commonly experienced crime in the UK, accounting for around 40% of all crime. Data indicates that fraud levels are increasing. Latest data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that there were 5.1 million reported instances of fraud in the year ending September 2021, a 36% increase compared to the year ending September 2019 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the public sector, the estimated cost of fraud is between Â£29 billion and Â£52 billion<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> per year. Fraud against the public sector can compromise public services and damage trust in government. Finding ways to help safeguard public funds through fraud prevention and detection programmes like the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> are important for protecting vital public services.</p>

<p>Recently, the emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant increases in government funding to support individuals and the economy through an uncertain and challenging period. The need to have in place fast and effective countermeasures to minimise fraud losses further highlights the importance of tools such as the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> to protect public funds.</p>

<p>Fraud is constantly evolving, becoming increasingly complex and digitally enabled. Over the past 25 years the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> has, and continues to respond to the ever-changing fraud risk landscape through exploiting new technologies to enhance data matching capabilities, and by broadening data sharing opportunities across the public and private sector. Cumulative detected and prevented savings identified from <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data matching now exceed Â£2 billion.</p>

<p>Examples of recent <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> developments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking a leading role in COVID-19 fraud prevention work by developing Bank Verification and Active Company Check products to flag anomalies in COVID-19 grant payment data</li>
  <li>working with the department for Business Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Business Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) to help identify and recover fraud losses from COVID-19 grant recipient funding</li>
  <li>delivering an ambitious innovation plan with the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> supplier Synectics Solutions, which includes enhancing <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> products Appcheck and Recheck, management information and council tax reports to improve usability and efficiency in data matching and data match reviews</li>
  <li>continuing to grow the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> pilot pipeline which has recently delivered counter fraud work in business rates, COVID-19 grant recipients, resident parking permits, and NHS student support</li>
  <li>sharing <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data more widely across government, including with the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and for use within other tools and products such as Spotlight and Quantexa</li>
  <li>continuing to grow and develop the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> FraudHub product, with enhancements such as dashboards and application programming interface (<abbr title="application programming interface">APIs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>publishing a consultation on the expansion of <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data matching powers, to help identify and prevent errors, recover debt, prevent and detect crime, and apprehend and prosecute offenders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Statutory Framework</h2>

<p>The Minister for the Cabinet Office, as the ârelevant ministerâ responsible for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>âs data matching exercises, conducts the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> under the statutory data matching powers in Part 6 and Schedule 9 to the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014. Under Schedule 9, the Minister for the Cabinet Office:</p>

<ul>
  <li>may conduct data matching exercises, or arrange for them to be conducted on the ministerâs behalf, for the purpose of assisting in the prevention and detection of fraud</li>
  <li>may require certain persons to provide data for data matching exercises</li>
  <li>may accept data submissions on a voluntary basis</li>
  <li>must prescribe a scale or scales of fees for mandatory data matching exercises</li>
  <li>may charge a fee to any body or person providing data, or receiving the results of a data matching exercise</li>
  <li>must consult mandatory participants, representatives of mandatory participants as the minister thinks appropriate, and other bodies or persons as the minister thinks appropriate before prescribing a scale or scales of fees for data matching exercises</li>
</ul>

<p>Our aim is to ensure that, while upholding and protecting citizensâ rights in relation to their personal data at all times, the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> continues to serve the public interest by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>safeguarding public money against losses from fraud or misappropriation</li>
  <li>making an effective contribution to the wider fight against fraud and potentially, other crime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proposed Work Programme</h2>

<p>We have reviewed the existing <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme to consider the datasets included in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>, as well as the list of organisations required to submit data. Our proposals are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove social care datasets from the list of mandatory data requirements for relevant organisations</li>
  <li>continue to mandate datasets, where appropriate, relevant to the COVID-19 grant relief programme (councils only)</li>
  <li>mandate the submission of data to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> from <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr> in place of Clinical Commissioning Groups (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>), in line with the reforms set out in the Health and Care Bill 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Appendix 1 sets out the proposed data requirements for all mandatory participants, by organisation type, for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise.</p>

<h2>Mandatory Dataset Proposals</h2>

<h3>Social care data</h3>

<p>Datasets that target fraud, error and overpayments in the social care sector have been mandatory <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> submissions for local authorities in England for several years. These datasets include residential care homes data, which was included in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme in 2004, followed by personal budget data in 2014. We match these datasets against deceased person data to identify cases where the local authority may have continued payments after a death has occurred. Personal budget data is also matched between local authorities to identify duplicate payments across one or more councils.</p>

<p>Social care data matches have generated over Â£25 million of savings for local authorities in this time.</p>

<p>In the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise, we postponed the collection of social care datasets to evaluate the effect of changes made to the National Health Service Act 2006, which reclassified this type of data as âpatient dataâ.</p>

<p>Our evaluation has concluded that while the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> is able to match patient data on a mandatory basis, we can only disclose data matching results to a relevant NHS body. As local authorities are not relevant NHS bodies as defined in Schedule 9 of the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014, the legislation would not permit the release of any social care data matches to local authorities.</p>

<p>Through engaging with <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants, we understand that social care data matches are valuable intelligence to help mitigate the risk of fraud and overpayments to care home providers and individuals in receipt of a personal budget. We are therefore working closely with legal representatives to explore alternative solutions to resolve this situation. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>voluntary data matching options independent of the core <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme, using alternative data matching powers such as the Digital Economy Act 2017 or local authoritiesâ own powers</li>
  <li>work to secure a legislative change to the restrictions on the use of patient data within the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>In the absence of a current legal power to mandate the inclusion of social care data in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>, we are proposing to remove both residential care homes and personal budgets data from the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme. These may be reintroduced in future work programmes should an appropriate resolution be found.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>A. Do you have any comments on the proposal to remove social care datasets from the NFI 2022/23 work programme, or any wider comments on the value of matching these datasets to identify fraud risks in this area?</p>
</div>

<h3>COVID-19 data</h3>

<p>As part of the governmentâs COVID-19 emergency response, significant measures were introduced to help alleviate social and economic pressures from the coronavirus pandemic. This included funding to support individuals and businesses through the provision of grants and payments, administered in part by local authorities.</p>

<p>To help provide a counter fraud response to these measures, the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 work programme extended the mandatory data requirements for local authorities to include COVID-19 grant funding data. During the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise this data has, and continues to be, used as part of a national data matching pilot to identify individuals and businesses that have received COVID-19 grants and payments that they were not entitled to.</p>

<p>To date, in collaboration with <abbr title="Business Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data matching has identified overpayments across three COVID-19 grant schemes during the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>small business grants fund</li>
  <li>retail, hospitality and leisure grant fund</li>
  <li>discretionary grant recipient schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>The pilot also matched grant recipient data to watch list data and then provided results to the National Anti-Fraud Network (<abbr title="National Anti-Fraud Network">NAFN</abbr>) for review. <abbr title="National Anti-Fraud Network">NAFN</abbr>âs review flagged new insights around impersonation fraud and they are now working with local authorities to help investigate potentially fraudulent matches.</p>

<p>Overpayments identified through this work are currently Â£5.4 million with continued savings still being realised. We are also continuing to target fraud across other COVID-19 grants through a second phase of matching in spring 2022.</p>

<p>For the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise, we will continue to work closely with <abbr title="Business Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and local authorities to understand any further benefits that <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> can offer from undertaking additional data matching on COVID-19 grants. To ensure we can act when needed, we are proposing to include COVID-19 grant recipient data in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme; however, we will only mandate data submission(s) if or when it is appropriate to do so. Should we deem it appropriate to request this data, we will communicate the data requirements and timetable to local authorities when necessary.</p>

<p>As with the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise, we do not propose to levy additional fees to cover the cost of this work, however we will seek additional funding from alternative sources where needed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>B. Do you have any comments on the proposal to continue to mandate data, as required, to target the fraud risks associated with COVID-19 grants or payments made by local authorities?</p>
</div>

<h3>Existing datasets</h3>

<p>We have reviewed the inclusion of existing mandatory datasets in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme by looking at the resulting benefits from our data matches. Our aim is to ensure that the data we collect and match is beneficial to participants and proportionate under data protection legislation to merit its inclusion in the exercise.</p>

<p>Our review highlighted that whilst the majority of datasets continue to show significant financial savings, benefits from right to buy (<abbr title="Right to buy">RTB</abbr>) data are low in comparison to other data areas and to <abbr title="Right to buy">RTB</abbr> savings reported in previous <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> exercises. Currently, we are not clear whether this is a one off reduction, or an indication of sustained reductions in future <abbr title="Right to buy">RTB</abbr> benefits. We therefore propose to retain this dataset for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise, but closely monitor its contribution through an ongoing assessment of benefits, and engagement with <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants and sector experts. This will enable us to make a more informed decision on its continued inclusion for future <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> exercises.</p>

<p>Therefore, with the exception of social care datasets as set out in paragraphs 26 to 31, we are proposing to retain all existing datasets for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise.</p>

<h3>Pilot data matches</h3>

<p>As well as reviewing the datasets included in our existing work programme, we have also assessed whether or not any data collected and matched as part of our pilot pipeline, should be included in the mandatory requirements for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise.</p>

<p>During the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise, a significant proportion of our pilot data matching work focused on developing and delivering solutions to target COVID-19 grants and payments.</p>

<p>Other pilot data matching included using new data and / or existing data with different match combinations, however these still need further work before we can draw full conclusions on the level of fraud they prevent and detect. For example, a pilot data match using residents parking permit data to identify where individuals have multiple permits across different boundary areas has identified some promising early results. We are continuing to explore this work through a secondary phase before making decisions to replicate it at a national level.</p>

<p>Therefore, considering the position of our existing pilots, we are not proposing to mandate the inclusion of any additional data in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme.</p>

<p>In addition to our pilot pipeline, we have continued to grow and develop our voluntary FraudHub product, which includes access to some of our current pilot datasets such as business rates data. One significant development due in summer 2022 will enable FraudHub users to submit and match data using their own legislative powers, allowing them to undertake data matching to address local fraud risks. Where these local matches show promise and meet <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> legislative powers, we can consider integrating relevant data into future <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programmes.</p>

<h3>Extension of Legislative Powers</h3>

<p>In February 2021, we launched a 12 week consultation on the proposed extension of legislative data matching powers that <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> uses to permit matching to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assist in the prevention and detection of crime (other than fraud)</li>
  <li>assist in the apprehension and prosecution of offenders</li>
  <li>assist in prevention and detection of errors and inaccuracies</li>
  <li>assist in the recovery of debt owing to public bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>These new powers can be included in schedule 9 of the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014 via an affirmative statutory instrument (<abbr title="statutory instrument">SI</abbr>), passed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Work to secure additional data matching powers remains ongoing, however it is outside the scope of this consultation, which focuses on <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data matching to prevent and detect fraud. Should Parliament enact any additional legislative powers, we would set out and consult on proposals for the work programme and associated scale of fees before mandating any data to use these powers. The data we mandate for counter fraud purposes such as the requirements set out in this document may not be used for other purposes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>C. Do you have any additional views on the proposed NFI 2022/23 work programme in relation to the required data submissions set out in Appendix 1?</p>
</div>

<h2>Mandatory Participants</h2>

<h3>Clinical Commissioning Groups</h3>

<p>The Health and Care Bill 2021 sets out proposals to reform the delivery and organisation of health services in England. It seeks to put Integrated Care Systems (<abbr title="Integrated Care Systems">ICSs</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> on a statutory footing, empowering them to support better collaboration across health and care services.</p>

<p>As part of these proposals, structural changes to <abbr title="Integrated Care Systems">ICSs</abbr> include establishing 42 Integrated Care Boards (<abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr>) to lead the existing <abbr title="Integrated Care Systems">ICSs</abbr> and take responsibility for NHS functions and budgets. <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr> will assume the commissioning responsibilities currently undertaken by Clinical Commissioning Groups (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>). Subsequently, once <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr> are legally established, <abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr> will cease to exist as statutory organisations. These changes are due to come into effect from 1 July 2022.</p>

<p><abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr> are a ârelevantâ authorityâ for the purposes of the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014 and have previously been mandated to provide data to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> under paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 9 to the <abbr title="Local Audit and Accountability Act">LAAA</abbr> 2014. Therefore, should the scheduled transfer of CCG functions to <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr> take place before the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data collection in autumn 2022, we propose to mandate the inclusion of <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr> in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme. This will include the submission of payroll and creditors data.</p>

<p>We will work with the relevant participants, either <abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr> or <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr>, at the appropriate time to agree how best to collect the mandatory data for <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>D. Do you have any comments on the proposal to mandate the inclusion of Integrated Care Boards in the NFI 2022/23 exercise, following the planned abolition of Clinical Commissioning Groups in July 2022?</p>
</div>

<h3>Proposed Scale of Fees</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> fee scale sets out the fees charged to <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants for delivery of the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> exercise. The fees levied cover the cost of delivering the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> exercise including the collation, processing and matching of participant data.</p>

<p>We have reviewed the existing <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> fee scale and propose the following in respect of the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the existing fee model which determines fees based on average dataset submissions and the number of high risk <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> matches by organisation type will be applied again for <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23</li>
  <li>fees for relevant organisations will be reduced by Â£220 to recognise the removal of social care datasets from the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme</li>
  <li>fees will increase by 1.75% per annum in line with average annual inflation for the period 2019 to 2021</li>
  <li>the policy to levy a 5% penalty fee where participants fail to comply with <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data submission requirements will remain in place for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise</li>
</ul>

<p>Table 1 details proposed <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 fees by organisation type. It shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 standard fee â including 1.75% per annum inflationary increase and adjustments for the removal of social care data</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 penalty fee â 5% increase on the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> standard fee</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 uplifted fee â the sum of the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> standard fee, plus the penalty fee, applicable to organisations that do not comply with data submission requirements</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 standard fee â for comparison to the previous <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> fee scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Fees are rounded to the nearest Â£5 following the application of inflationary increases and penalties</p>

<h2>Fee Model</h2>

<h3>Fee model review</h3>

<p>For the last <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> exercise, we consulted on and implemented significant changes to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> fee model, which generates the fee scale for mandatory <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants. This was in response to previous challenge from participants over the fairness of the fee scale, as well as the development of the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> programme over time.</p>

<p>The existing fee scale now prescribes fees by organisation type, underpinned by the number of datasets submitted to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> and the proportion of high risk matches that each organisation type receives. Dataset submissions are relevant because they determine the costs we incur to process and match <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data. A greater number of datasets means higher data processing charges. The inclusion of high risk data matches is relevant because these matches are a good indicator of potential savings and benefits that could be realised by participants.</p>

<p>Organisation types are scored based on their average datasets and high risk matches, with higher fees applied to organisations with higher scores. The aim of this model is to levy higher fees to participants that have the potential to gain the most out of <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> matching.</p>

<p>We have undertaken a reasonableness check on the existing model, which involved recalculating organisation scores using the most recent data from the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise. This did not flag any anomalies, demonstrating that the fee model continues to produce a fair and consistent fee scale.  Subsequently, we propose to retain and implement the existing model to produce the fee scale for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>E. Do you have any comments on the proposal to retain the existing fee model to generate the fee scale for the NFI 2022/23 exercise? This model determines fees based on the number of datasets submitted and the volume of high risk NFI matches received by participants.</p>
</div>

<h3>Adjustment for Social Care Data</h3>

<p>As set out in paragraphs 26 to 31, social care datasets including residential care homes and personal budget data will not be included in the mandatory data submission requirements for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise. To recognise and reflect this reduced work programme in the fee scale, we feel it is appropriate to adjust fees accordingly for organisations that would normally submit this data. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>County Councils</li>
  <li>County Councils with Fire</li>
  <li>London Borough Councils</li>
  <li>Metropolitan Borough Councils</li>
  <li>Unitary Authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>We recognise that in some cases, councils from the list above may not usually hold, or submit social care datasets to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>. However, we prescribe <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> fees on the assumption that data is typically held, and submitted for a particular organisation type, irrespective of individual local circumstances. Therefore, any fee amendments to reflect the removal of social care data will be applicable to all organisations within the categories listed above, regardless of whether or not they have previously submitted social care data to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>We explored three different options to model the removal of social care datasets from existing <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> fees. Two of these options considered what proportion of <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> dataset submissions and high risk matches derive from social care datasets, and then applied this reduction to the fees. These models resulted in fee reductions ranging from Â£100 to Â£300 per organisation, averaging at a reduction of Â£221 and Â£213 respectively.</p>

<p>The third option linked the discount to the additional programme costs associated with the inclusion of these datasets in the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>. In this model, fees for relevant organisations would reduce by Â£220.</p>

<p>Following this review, our proposal is to apply a fee reduction of Â£220 for the organisations listed in paragraph 62 to acknowledge the removal of two social care datasets from the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> work programme. We feel this is the fairest and simplest approach, which provides the same fee reduction for all relevant organisations. It also aligns with our overall fee model principles to levy charges in part, based on the volume of data submitted.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>F. Do you have any views on the proposal to reduce fees by Â£220 to reflect the removal of social care data from the NFI work programme for relevant organisations?</p>
</div>

<h2>Fee Increase</h2>

<h3>What will the increase be?</h3>

<p>For the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise, we consulted on and, levied a 9.4% increase to participant fees, following a long period of fee freezes. This increase derived from a need to cover cost pressures and the ambition to invest more money into the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>, enabling us to develop better technologies, data sources and data matching techniques to provide more benefits to <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>Participant responses to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 fees consultation indicated that large fee increases can be difficult to manage and that smaller incremental increases linked to inflation are a more favourable approach.</p>

<p>Taking on board this feedback, we are proposing to uplift existing fees for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise by the average annual <abbr title="Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs">CPIH</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> inflation rate of 1.75% per annum for the period 2019 to 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. This uplift will apply to all organisationsâ mandatory fees and the resulting income will cover increases in <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> operating costs, with any balance invested in <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> developments.</p>

<p>We remain committed to keeping our <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> mandatory fees as low as possible. Our approach includes seeking to increase our income streams from our voluntary products and participants.  We will also explore alternative funding options, for example securing funding for innovative developments, which realise net gains for the investor and wider benefits for other participants.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>G. Do you agree that it is reasonable to increase fees in line with the average annual inflation rate of 1.75% per annum for the period 2019 to 2021? Please provide your reasons why.</p>
</div>

<h2>Penalty Fee</h2>

<p>In the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise, we introduced the policy of a penalty fee, which uplifts a participantâs fee by 5% where they fail to comply with <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> dataset submission requirements. This policy was introduced to improve the timeliness and accuracy of data submitted to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Providing data on time and to good quality standards is beneficial to all <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants and helps to ensure efficient delivery of the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> programme. Late or poor quality data submissions result in additional work to undertake supplementary match run(s) following the main scheduled match release. This requires additional <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> resource, which then affects other aspects of the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> programme. In addition, because the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> undertakes data matching between participants, late or poor quality submissions can generate additional work for others, which risks hindering the effective and thorough follow up of data matches. This is unfair on those participants that do comply with data submission requirements.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of the data penalty policy, the proportion of expected datasets received on time for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2020/21 exercise increased to a record 95%. The number of organisations that failed to submit data by the deadline reduced by 46%, and we delivered only one supplementary match run compared to two in <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2018/19. Our data processors also indicated that there was an improvement in the overall quality of data submissions, which helped to reduce the need for multiple resubmissions.</p>

<p>Given the improvements shown in the last exercise, there is evidence to suggest that the penalty fee policy encourages better compliance, which in turn reduces our costs and helps maximise efficiency of the exercise. We therefore propose to continue with this policy for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise, with any income generated used to fund the work to deliver supplementary match runs. Any remaining monies will fund further developments and enhancements to the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> product range.</p>

<p>As in the last <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> exercise, we will endeavour to support <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> participants with their data submissions as far as possible, and ensure we communicate the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> timetable and supporting information around expected data quality standards well in advance of the data submission deadline. We will apply leniency for mitigating circumstances that we deem beyond a participantâs control. Each case will be assessed on its merits with a review process to ensure any penalty fees levied are fair and consistent<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Questions to consider:</h3>

<p>H. Do you have any comments on the proposal to continue with the policy to levy a 5% penalty fee for late or poor quality data submissions?</p>
</div>

<h2>Invoicing arrangements</h2>

<p>Each <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> data matching exercise is run over a two year period, so the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 work programme and scale of fees covers the financial years 2022/23 and 2023/24. To avoid duplicating administration, participants will be billed in one instalment between January and March 2023.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> web application includes a dedicated billing page, which enables participants to provide billing information and purchase order numbers for inclusion on the invoices.</p>

<h2>Timetable</h2>

<p>A provisional timetable for the <abbr title="National Fraud Initiative">NFI</abbr> 2022/23 exercise is set out in Table 2. The final timetable will be communicated to participants once this consultation has concluded. It will also be available to view on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Please note the timetable for any COVID-19 related work will be communicated to local authorities separately as required.</p>
