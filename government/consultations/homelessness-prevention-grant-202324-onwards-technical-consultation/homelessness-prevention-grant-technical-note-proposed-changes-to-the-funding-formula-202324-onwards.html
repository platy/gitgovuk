<p>This document provides a technical description of the two options proposed in the 2022 Homelessness Prevention Grant consultation for updates to the funding formula, which would apply for 2023/24 onwards.</p>

<p>Both proposed options consider the allocations in 2 elements. The first element considers the allocation of £200m using a similar method to the Flexible Homelessness Support Grant formula. The second element considers the allocation of £110m using a similar method to the new formula first introduced in 2021/22 for the uplift in funding following a review of the Homelessness Reduction Act new burdens (referred to as the Homelessness Reduction Act uplift formula).</p>

<p>To note: This technical note outlines the proposed formula options based on the 2021/22 overall HPG amount of £310m. This does not mean that the overall amount of the grant will be £310m in 2023-24 or any future years. Decisions on overall funding for those years will be taken in due course. Allocations are very likely to change prior to confirmation.</p>

<p>In addition, we are proposing introducing transitional arrangements to minimise the impact of changes in allocations following updates to the formula. Please see the full consultation document for a comprehensive overview of the proposals.</p>

<h2>Option 1</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> £200m</h3>

<p>Relative homelessness pressures would be calculated by adding the number of acceptances + prevention and relief cases achieved by securing a private rented sector tenancy, with the following adjustments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accounting for private sector rental costs in different areas<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>ensuring a minimum allocation level of £40,000</li>
  <li>ensuring that no authority receives an annual allocation less than 90% of their 3-year average historic spend share on temporary accommodation costs<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> £110m</h3>

<p>The first 80% of the funding (worth £88m) would be allocated using a relative estimate of pressures using the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: The number of housing benefit claimants. This is the sum of private and social rented sector housing benefit claimants and households on universal credit with a housing entitlement in the private and social rented sector. This information can be found on DWP stat Xplore.</li>
  <li>B: Lower quartile monthly private rented sector rents for 2-bedroom properties<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>C: Area cost adjustment, as used in allocating COVID-19 related funding to lower-tier authorities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Calculated using the following formula:</p>

<p>Pressure = A * (B + C * 8 hours * £15 per hour)</p>

<p>The allocation for each local authority would be derived as the proportion of the total pressure across all local authorities.</p>

<p>The remaining 20% of the funding (worth £22m) would be allocated based on the share of total single adult households owed a prevention or a relief duty<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>An additional area-cost adjustment (ACA)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> would be applied to the entire £110m (HRA uplift formula).</p>

<h3>Missing data</h3>

<p>Where H-CLIC data is not available, local authority-level estimates would be calculated by apportioning published regional figures. Using the total figures for London and the Rest of England, we would calculate the amount of data within a given dataset that is attributable to local authorities with missing data, by subtracting the sum of data provided by local authorities from the total figure.</p>

<p>To distribute the remaining data to local authorities with missing data, we would distribute the data to local authorities with missing data using their percentage share of a 3-year average of historic TA spend.</p>

<p>If historic TA spend is not available for a given local authority, we would calculate their share using a population-weighted ACA.</p>

<p>The data would then be distributed using either of these shares and adjusted using a missing data multiplier of 0.75 (ensuring local authorities cannot gain by not providing data). For example, if there were 4000 units of missing data to be allocated and a local authority had a share of 10%, they would be allocated 300 units (= 4000 * 0.1 * 0.75).</p>

<h2>Option 2</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> £200m</h3>

<p>Number of acceptances + prevention and relief cases achieved by securing a private rented sector tenancy, with the following adjustments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accounting for private sector rental costs in different areas<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>ensuring a minimum allocation level of £40,000</li>
  <li>ensuring that no authority receives less than 75% of their relative Area Cost Adjustment-weighted population share<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>

</li>
  <li>C: Area cost adjustment, as used in allocating COVID-19 related funding to lower-tier authorities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>
