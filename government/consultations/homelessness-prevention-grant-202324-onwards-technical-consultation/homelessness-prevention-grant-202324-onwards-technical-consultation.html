<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> The case for change</h2>

<p>1.1 The government is committed to preventing homelessness before it occurs wherever possible. The landmark Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 is ensuring that more people get help earlier, reducing the risk that households become homeless. Intervening at the earliest stage and helping people to resolve their situation before reaching crisis point is better for the households concerned and reduces costs to the state and wider society.</p>

<p>1.2 Our data shows that intervening when a person is at risk of losing their accommodation is overall more effective in tackling homelessness. Between October and December 2021, 54% percent of prevention duties â owed to households at risk of homelessness â ended in secured accommodation, as opposed to 45% of relief duties owed at the point a household is homeless. We want to see a shift further towards prioritising prevention activity among local authorities and partners.</p>

<p>1.3 In December 2021, there were 96,410 households in temporary accommodation (<abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>) in England, including 118,900 children. Whilst time spent in <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> means households are getting help, it does not address the root causes of homelessness. The government is committed to making sure that households have their homelessness resolved without being placed in <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> wherever possible.</p>

<p>1.4 <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> can also be expensive, but the benefits of preventing homelessness before it occurs go further than just fiscal benefits. Enabling people to stay in their homes and remain in their communities â for example by helping them to develop the skills to sustain a tenancy or supporting them into gainful employment â has considerable long-term benefits on both community cohesion and individual health and wellbeing. Intervening early also minimises the impact homelessness has on wider public services â including (but not limited to) the courts system and public health services.</p>

<p>1.5 Alongside incentivising prevention, we are mindful of the context in which homelessness services are operating. We recognise housing market pressures are particularly acute in certain areas, and that we need to make sure that local authorities are funded for <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> costs where these are outside their control.</p>

<p>1.6 In recent decades, homelessness services have been funded at various points through a combination of the general local government settlement, and bespoke grant funding.</p>

<p>1.7 Grant funding for homelessness was most recently reintroduced in 2017 with the Flexible Homelessness Support Grant (Â£186m in 2017/18), which replaced the Temporary Accommodation Management Fee in order to give local authorities more flexibility over their spend on homelessness and to support them to invest in prevention. This was accompanied by Â£73m in new burdens funding over 3 years (2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20) to support the implementation of the Homelessness Reduction Act.</p>

<p>1.8 Â£200m of funding through the Flexible Homelessness Support Grant was announced in 2020/21, and the Homelessness Reduction Grant was introduced to enable local authorities to continue meeting the costs of the Homelessness Reduction Act following the expiry of the original new burdens funding arrangements.</p>

<p>1.9 In 2021/22, the Flexible Homelessness Support Grant and the Homelessness Reduction Grant were combined into the Homelessness Prevention Grant (<abbr title="Homelessness Prevention Grant">HPG</abbr>) and were uplifted by Â£47m. <abbr title="Homelessness Prevention Grant">HPG</abbr> funding is provided to all local authorities with responsibility for housing, to support them to deliver their statutory obligations under the Housing Act 1996. It can be used flexibly to help deliver the authoritiesâ homelessness and rough sleeping strategies.</p>

<p>1.10 The Homelessness Prevention Grant totalled Â£310m in 2021/22 (excluding the exceptional Â£65m top-up announced in October 2021 to help vulnerable households with rent arrears)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> and Â£315.8m in 2022/23 (including Â£5.8m in Domestic Abuse Act new burdens funding). For ease of comparisons throughout the document we use 2021/22 funding as the baseline year (totalling Â£310m).</p>

<p>1.11 The Homelessness Prevention Grant is just one element of the funding local authorities can access to prevent homelessness, as shown in the diagram below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Figure 1.2 â Homelessness funding: funding streams available to local housing authorities</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/155113/figure_1.2.png"></div></figure>

<ul>
  <li>HM Treasury â DLUHC DEL â Homelessness Prevention Grant (ringfenced in 2021/22) â Local authority</li>
  <li>HM Treasury â Local Govt DEL â Local Govt Settlement (non-ringfenced) â Local authority</li>
  <li>HM Treasury â DWP DEL â Discretionary Housing Payment (ringfenced, statutory criteria) â Local authority</li>
  <li>HM Treasury â DWP AME â Housing Benefit TA subsidy â Local authority</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>1.12 The purpose of funding provided by the Department for Work and Pensions through Discretionary Housing Payments is not solely for homelessness, but we are aware that in practice some local authorities use this funding to help prevent homelessness to varying extents.</p>

<p>1.13 The use of these funding streams can overlap at various points - for example, the cost of temporary accommodation can be met through the Local Government Settlement or the Homelessness Prevention Grant, and payments to support vulnerable households with rent arrears can be funded from the Homelessness Prevention Grant, Local Government Settlement or via Discretionary Housing Payments. This intersection between the various streams has resulted in a complex funding landscape, and has made it challenging to understand if there are sufficient incentives to invest in prevention.</p>

<p>1.14 The most recent multi-year spending review, covering 2022-25, provides an opportunity to look again at the homelessness funding landscape and develop a longer-term ambition for the Homelessness Prevention Grant. We need to update our data sources to make sure funding continues to be fairly allocated according to current pressures, and we want to improve our understanding of how the grant is used. This improved understanding will enable us to identify effective interventions (including through prevention activity) in order to improve shared learning across local authorities, and make sure the grant is sustainable for the future. This will help to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping and support the governmentâs commitment to fully enforce the Homelessness Reduction Act.</p>

<p>1.15 Looking beyond 2025, we want to simplify the funding landscape and end the current mixed economy which can mean short-term pressures to fund temporary accommodation have to be traded off against the opportunity to invest in prevention. To do this, we must first understand what is working well and how current funding streams are being used. The proposals in this consultation are the first steps towards achieving this.</p>

<p>1.16 For the proposals in this consultation, we understand the need to make sure changes strike the right balance between achieving better outcomes for homeless households and improving accountability whilst not being too administratively burdensome for authorities. This will allow us to develop a sustainable approach to funding arrangements for the future.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Overview of the consultation</h2>

<p>2.1 This consultation is seeking input from local authorities and other interested stakeholders on 5 key proposals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updating the funding formula so that it reflects current <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> pressures</li>
  <li>Introducing transitional arrangements for changes to funding allocations</li>
  <li>Determining the timing of the announcements of 2023/24 and 2024/25 allocations, including a possible 2-year funding allocation</li>
  <li>Adding a grant condition to require local authorities to submit additional spend declaration information under the categories of âprevention and reliefâ and â<abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>â and âmain duty/otherâ</li>
  <li>Introducing tranche payments and requiring accurate <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> statistics (Homelessness Case Level Information Collection - data returns submitted by local authorities to <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>) to be submitted to receive the second tranche of funding</li>
</ul>

<p>2.2 The aims of this consultation are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To make sure that funding is distributed fairly to local authorities and is driven by a current picture of need</li>
  <li>To make sure any changes to funding allocations can be incorporated into service delivery, continuing to enable local authorities to meet their statutory homelessness duties</li>
  <li>To improve government understanding of how the grant is spent and to help government understand what drives good performance, which should support the longer-term aim to focus the grant more on prevention activity</li>
  <li>To enhance shared learning across authorities in terms of maximising prevention activity, enabling local authorities to achieve better outcomes</li>
  <li>To improve government understanding of the impact of the funding, particularly in relation to temporary accommodation outcomes, by incentivising more consistent data reporting by local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>2.3 This consultation is reviewing the local allocation and conditions of the funding, rather than the overall level of funding available for the Homelessness Prevention Grant. Your input will help government to take an informed decision on the funding distribution model, allocations and grant conditions for 2023/24, 2024/25 and beyond. Your input will also help government to strike the right balance between enhanced scrutiny and accuracy of the funding modelâs reflection of needs alongside sustainability of changes and the relative importance of each of these factors.</p>

<p>2.4 This consultation is open for response from 1 July to 26 August. We will also be holding focus groups with a selection of local authorities during the consultation period. We will publish our consultation response alongside the allocations in late 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Amendments to the funding formula</h2>

<h3>Background: the current allocations formula</h3>

<p>3.1 At present, the Homelessness Prevention Grant is allocated to local authorities based on a formula which aims to reflect relative homelessness pressures in each area. There are some elements of this formula which the government wants to update in order to ensure the formula continues to allocate funding in a fair way. We want to make sure that allocations are fair and can be updated regularly, in a way which reflects current demand in local areas.</p>

<p>3.2 As referenced above, the overall funding provided in 2021/22 was Â£310m<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. The current formula is split into 3 key calculations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£200m allocated in the same way as the former Flexible Homelessness Support Grant (<abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Â£63m allocated in the same way as the former Homelessness Reduction Grant (<abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Grant">HRG</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Â£47m, introduced as an uplift in 2021/22, allocated using a new formula that takes into account relative homelessness pressures</li>
</ul>

<p>A full overview of the current formula can be found at Figure 1.3 below.</p>

<h4>Current HPG funding formula</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Â£200m - allocated in the same way as the Flexible Homelessness Support Grant (FHSG)</li>
  <li>Â£63m - allocated in the same way as the Homelessness Reduction Grant (HRG)</li>
  <li>Â£46m - 2021/22 uplift: a relative estimate of pressures</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>Â£200m â FHSG formula</h4>

<p>Number of case acceptances + Number of prevention and relief cases which ended with a private rented sector tenancy (using projections from March 2017 DLUHC data).</p>

<p>Applying the following adjustments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accounting for private sector rental costs in different areas</li>
  <li>ensuring a minimum allocation level of Â£40,000</li>
  <li>ensuring no authority receives less than 75% of what we estimate they would have received under the DWP Temporary Accommodation Management Fee (TAMF) in 2019/20 (DLUHC Homelessness data for the financial year 2016/17 is used to estimate levels of the DWP fee, then projected into the future based on current trends)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>Â£63m â HRG formula</h4>

<p>Part A: Â£47.9m</p>

<p>Funding is allocated regionally based on different sub-formulas using RO4 homelessness expenditure data (DLUHC Local authority revenue expenditure and financing, revenue outturn housing services)</p>

<ul>
  <li>and H-CLIC data on number of people with duty owed and main duty acceptances</li>
  <li>Funding is distributed to individual authorities using ONS midyear population estimates and Index of Multiple Deprivation average scores</li>
</ul>

<p>Part B: Â£15m</p>

<ul>
  <li>Funding is allocated regionally using: 15 * total net homelessness expenditure / total net homelessness expenditure in England</li>
  <li>Funding is distributed to individual authorities using ONS midyear population estimates and Index of Multiple Deprivation average scores</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>Â£47m â HRA uplift</h4>

<h3>Combining the formulas used for the Â£47m and Â£63m elements</h3>

<p>3.3 The <abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Grant">HRG</abbr> (Â£63m) and <abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Act">HRA</abbr> uplift (Â£47m) elements of the formula have similar purposes â they both aim to predict and weight funding according to local homelessness prevention and relief pressures. Our modelling indicates that local authorities receive proportionately similar levels of funding across both formulas. We therefore perceive it to be unnecessarily complex to retain 2 separate formulas in this case, and that extending the formula used for one element to both would simplify the formula, making it easier to understand and administer.</p>

<p>3.4 The Â£63m <abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Grant">HRG</abbr> formula relies more heavily on local authority self-reported <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data. Whilst using <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data identifies local authorities who have undertaken Homelessness Reduction Act activity, it doesnât identify earlier stage prevention work â for example, tenancy sustainment services, or establishing comprehensive supported housing pathways â i.e. prevention work that falls outside of the Homelessness Reduction Act duties. We therefore propose using the more up to date <abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Act">HRA</abbr> uplift formula (which relies significantly less on <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data) for the entire Â£110m. This means that the <abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Grant">HRG</abbr> element of the formula, as set out above, will no longer be used within the calculation.</p>

</div>

<h3>Applying an Area-Cost Adjustment to the combined Â£110m</h3>

<p>3.5 We currently apply an area-cost adjustment (<abbr title="area-cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>) to one part of the <abbr title="Homelessness Reduction Act">HRA</abbr> uplift formula, as set out in Figure 1.3 above. The <abbr title="area-cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> aims to reflect the relative costs of staffing wages and providing frontline services. We propose to expand this <abbr title="area-cost adjustment">ACA</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> for the wider Â£110m element of the formula for all local authorities. We propose this to recognise that it is more difficult to prevent homelessness in areas with high costs, in particular areas with acute housing market pressures that limit the supply of affordable properties and make prevention very challenging, in a way which can be difficult to capture through traditional datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Do you agree with our proposal to apply an overall ACA in the Â£110m element of the formula? (Yes â No â Indifferent - Not sure)</p>
</div>

<h3>Determining a new proxy for temporary accommodation pressures within the <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> element (Â£200m)</h3>

<p>3.6 We recognise that some areas have higher <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> pressures than others and that this can be driven by factors outside of a local authorityâs control â such as the affordability of housing in the local area. The <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> element of the formula aims to estimate relative temporary accommodation (<abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>) pressures. It uses historic data from the defunct <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Temporary Accommodation Management Fee (<abbr title="Temporary Accommodation Management Fee">TAMF</abbr>) â a grant specifically used to fund the administration of <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> for local authorities, but which was discontinued in 2016. The formula uses <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> data to estimate levels of <abbr title="Temporary Accommodation Management Fee">TAMF</abbr> the local authority would have received in 2016/17, projected into the future, ensuring no authority received less than 75% of what we estimate they would have received under the <abbr title="Temporary Accommodation Management Fee">TAMF</abbr> (although cash allocations have been rolled over since 2019/20).</p>

<p>3.7 It is not reasonable to continue using this data source in future years, given it may not be representative of current pressures. We therefore propose to amend the element of the funding formula which is based on the historic <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> formula, by updating the data source we use as an indicator for <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> pressures. This will support a fair and sustainable way of allocating the funding. There are different data sources that can provide a reliable indicator of the drivers of <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> pressures.</p>

<p>3.8 In light of the above, we have outlined 2 options which we consider to be reasonable and proportionate approaches to updating the <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> element of the formula to remove the <abbr title="Temporary Accommodation Management Fee">TAMF</abbr> element for 2023/24 onwards (subject to funding decisions at subsequent Spending Reviews):</p>

<h4>Option 1:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Replace the <abbr title="Temporary Accommodation Management Fee">TAMF</abbr> element of the formula with 90% of 3-year average of historic temporary accommodation (<abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>) spend<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> element of the formula would still be calculated in the same way as before, but with 90% of historic <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> spend now replacing the <abbr title="Temporary Accommodation Management Fee">TAMF</abbr> element of the formula. Local authorities would be allocated either the greater of their share of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The sum of their homelessness acceptances, prevention into the PRS, relief into the PRS, accounting for PRS rents data, or</li>
  <li>90% of their historic <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> spend data, or</li>
  <li>Â£40,000</li>
</ul>

<p>whichever is the greatest in value.</p>

<h3>Missing data</h3>

<p>3.9 The <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data needed to run the formula is not always available. This can be the case where accurate data for all 4 quarters in a given year was not provided.</p>

<p>3.10 Where accurate data was not provided, local authority-level estimates are calculated by apportioning published regional figures. Using the total figures for London and the Rest of England, we calculate the amount of data within a given dataset that is attributable to local authorities with missing data. We do this by subtracting the sum of data provided by local authorities from the total figure.</p>

<p>3.11 To distribute the remaining data to local authorities with missing data, we propose 2 options:</p>

<h4>Option 1:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Distribute the data to local authorities with missing data using their percentage share of a 3-year average of historic <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> spend.</li>
  <li>If historic <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> spend is not available for a given local authority, instead calculate their share using a population-weighted <abbr title="area-cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The data is then distributed using either of these shares, and is adjusted using a missing data multiplier of 0.75 (this ensures local authorities cannot gain by not providing data). For example, if there were 4000 units of missing data to be allocated and a local authority had a share of 10%, they would be allocated 300 units (= 4000 * 0.1 * 0.75).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Option 2:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Allocate the data to local authorities with missing data using their percentage share of population weighted area cost adjustment (<abbr title="area-cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>). A population weighted <abbr title="area-cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> is available for all local authorities, so a share would be able to be produced for any local authority with missing data under this method.</li>
  <li>The data is then distributed using these shares, and is adjusted using a missing data multiplier of 0.75 (this ensures local authorities cannot gain by not providing data). For example, if there were 4000 units of missing data to be allocated and a local authority had a share of 10%, they would be allocated 300 units (= 4000 * 0.1 * 0.75).</li>

<h3>The other data sources used in the <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> element (Â£200m)</h3>

<p>3.12 As outlined in figure 1.3, prior to adjustments, the <abbr title="Flexible Homelessness Support Grant">FHSG</abbr> element of the formula currently calculates pressures using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homelessness case acceptances (<abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>The number of prevention and relief cases which ended in securing a PRS tenancy (<abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Private rented sector costs data<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>3.13 We are still considering these elements of the formula and are seeking views as to whether these still represent an accurate reflection of homelessness pressures. In particular, we are considering the metric of âthe number of prevention and relief cases which ended in securing a PRS tenancyâ, as we are mindful that the ability of certain authorities to secure tenancies in the PRS has reduced in recent years (such as those with particular housing market pressures limiting availability of affordable PRS properties). The illustrative allocations provided alongside this document are based on the current method, i.e. the number of prevention and relief cases which ended in securing a PRS tenancy.</p>

<h3>The overall allocations formula and illustrative allocations</h3>

<p>3.14 As you can see from the options above, there are multiple variables we can alter in the formula. Illustrative allocations are included alongside this document, showing the potential funding allocations combining the âOption 1â approaches, as well as the impact of combining the âOption 2â approaches. We have produced these to help inform the consultation and show the impacts of different combinations. We will not necessarily take forward the options above and will use feedback from the consultation to inform our final allocations formula.</p>

<p>3.15 The allocations provided alongside this document are to be treated as illustrative only â they have been calculated using historic data and are subject to any newly released data in 2022. The illustrative allocations are based on the 2021/22 overall <abbr title="Homelessness Prevention Grant">HPG</abbr> amount of Â£310m. This does not mean that the overall amount of the grant will be Â£310m in 2023/24 or any future years. Decisions on overall funding for those years will be taken in due course. Allocations are very likely to change prior to confirmation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Transitional arrangements for 2023/24 and 2024/25</h2>

<h3>Introducing transitional arrangements to minimise the impact of changes in allocations following a refreshed formula</h3>

<p>4.1 The proposed updates to the formula used to distribute funding will increase or decrease the funding available to each local authority. These changes will ensure that distribution of funding continues to represent current pressures. However, the changes to allocations have the potential to be significant, depending on the extent to which the new formula for determining <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> pressures differs from historical data.</p>

<p>4.2 To provide stability to local services, and to mitigate against significant changes from previous allocations in the short-term, we propose to introduce transitional arrangements by capping the percentage change in funding for each local authority. This would prevent sudden and unsustainable shifts in funding, and associated risks to local service delivery, by reducing the impact of significant funding changes. We propose this as a temporary, transitional measure, with the aim of giving services time to adjust to the changes in their funding.</p>

<p>4.3 We propose to limit the change in funding allocation to 5% in 2023/24 and 10% in 2024/25, when compared to the authorityâs allocation for 2022/23. This means that the percentage change in allocation for each authority will be capped at 5% in 2023/24 and 10% in 2024/25. This will apply irrespective of whether the percentage change is an increase or decrease. In order to facilitate this, funding allocations will be adjusted across areas, including areas which have an unadjusted percentage change below the cap. We would review this approach for 2025 onwards.</p>

<p>4.4 We plan to allocate funding for 2023/24 and 2024/25 in late 2022. This means that we would be able to announce the next 2 financial years of funding this year, providing early certainty to local authorities and allowing them time to plan and structure their homelessness services.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<p>Area A has a funding allocation of Â£865,000 in 2022/23. Under the updated funding formula, they have a funding allocation of Â£1,113,000 for 2023/24, and Â£1,113,000 for 2024/25.</p>

<p>Transitional arrangements are then applied, which caps the percentage change at 5% between 2022/23 and 2023/24, and at 10% between 2022/23 and 2024/25. Area Aâs adjusted allocations are as follows:</p>

<p>2023/24: Â£865,000 x 1.05 (5% cap) = <strong>Â£908,250</strong><br>
2024/25: Â£865,000 x 1.10 (10% cap) = <strong>Â£951,500</strong></p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<p>Area B has a funding allocation of Â£400,000 in 2022/23. Under the updated funding formula, they have a funding allocation of Â£320,000 for 2023/24, and Â£320,000 for 2024/25.</p>

<p>Transitional arrangements are then applied, which caps the percentage change at 5% between 2022/23 and 2023/24, and at 10% between 2022/23 and 2024/25. Area Bâs adjusted allocations are as follows:</p>

<p>2023/24: Â£400,000 x 0.95 (5% cap) = <strong>Â£380,000</strong><br>
2024/25: Â£400,000 x 0.9 (10% cap) = <strong>Â£360,000</strong></p>
</div>

<p>4.5 We are seeking views on the percentage proposed for transitional arrangements, recognising the need to balance accurately allocating funding to the most acute pressures whilst also ensuring service delivery sustainability. While not introducing transitional arrangements would allow for the most accurate reflection of need in our funding model, it is also important to ensure any changes to funding year-on-year are sustainable and any impacts on service delivery are minimised. A larger cap would carry an increased risk of jeopardising sustained service delivery and infrastructure in some local authorities if there are sudden notable reductions in funding.</p>

<h3>Announcement of 2023/24 and 2024/25 allocations</h3>

<p>4.6 In recent years, the Homelessness Prevention Grant has been announced on an annual basis. This has been in line with single year spending reviews and enabled us to adjust allocations each year to reflect changing circumstances, such as the uplift in 2021/22 to support the full enforcement of the Homelessness Reduction Act. We recognise though that this limits the ability of local authorities to plan services more strategically and commission specialist services and can make it harder to recruit and retain staff. The most recent multi-year spending review provides the option of announcing both the 2023/24 and 2024/25 allocations in late 2022. We plan to do this to give early certainty to local authorities of their funding over the next 2 years to support them to plan and deliver specialist services via the grant funding, as well as improve staff retention rates.</p>

<p>4.7 This carries the risk that, if homelessness pressures shift significantly between 2023 and 2024, allocations for the 2024/25 financial year may not reflect the most up-to-date pressures. Alternatively, the allocations could be announced on a single year basis.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Additional spend declaration: assigning spend to categories</h2>

<h3>Background: current spend reporting requirements</h3>

<p>5.1 At present, the Homelessness Prevention Grant can be spent flexibly by local authorities to meet their homelessness and rough sleeping objectives. The grant conditions require that the funding be spent in adherence with certain principles and requirements, including fully enforcing the Homelessness Reduction Act, maximising homelessness prevention, and ensuring the financial viability of services. At the end of the financial year, a declaration from the local authority must be submitted, confirming that the grant has been spent in line with these conditions.</p>

<p>5.2 Whilst this provides assurance that the grant is being used in line with the governmentâs wider homelessness and rough sleeping objectives, it does not give a comprehensive picture of how funding is spent by local authorities. We do not know, for example, how much of the grant is spent on <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>, versus prevention or other spend.</p>

<p>5.3 Performance on homelessness prevention varies significantly across local authorities, even when comparing economically and demographically similar areas. This means that there are inconsistent outcomes for homeless households across the country, including between authorities with similar funding levels. Our lack of data on grant spend makes it more difficult to link interventions to homelessness outcomes and restricts shared learning across local authorities. It also prevents us from being able to fully understand how the current funding arrangements influence spending decisions at a local level.</p>

<h3>An additional requirement to report spend as âprevention and reliefâ, â<abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>â or âmain duty/ otherâ</h3>

<p>5.4 In order to enhance overall understanding of how the grant is used, and to drive performance on prevention, we are proposing to add a condition to the grant determination requiring local authorities to report the value of grant funding which has been spent within the categories of âprevention and reliefâ, â<abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>â and âmain duty/ otherâ at the end of the financial year (as well as a forecast part way through the year). This will be purely an information gathering exercise and will not be used to influence any aspect of the allocations formula.</p>

<p>5.5 We have outlined what we believe constitutes prevention and relief, <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> and main duty/ other spend below:</p>

<h4>Prevention and relief</h4>

<p>Staffing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prevention and relief officers and management</li>
  <li>Triage officers</li>
  <li>Link/ liaison/ partner (duty to refer) roles</li>
  <li>Tenancy sustainment staff</li>
  <li>Housing advice staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Incentive schemes - payment to a new landlord:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incentive payment (prevention/ relief duty)</li>
  <li>Payment of upfront costs (prevention/ relief duty)</li>
</ul>

<p>Incentive schemes - payment to an existing landlord:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incentive payment to retain household</li>
  <li>Payment of rent arrears</li>
  <li>Payment for repairs/improvements (prevention/ relief duty)</li>
</ul>

<p>Incentive schemes - payment to a household:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reimbursement of upfront costs (prevention/ relief duty)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Externally commissioned homelessness services/ staff</li>
  <li>Purchasing household goods (main duty)</li>
</ul>

<p>5.6 Costs arising from work undertaken during the main housing duty would be classed as âmain duty/otherâ spend for these purposes. We are aware that staff will often have roles spanning across various types of homelessness support â in this case, staffing costs can be categorised as âprevention and reliefâ spend if more than 50% of their role consists of prevention and/or relief work (we recognise that in some cases, this will be determined via an estimate). <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> spend will encompass <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> costs net of Housing Benefit, including costs associated with the administration, inspection, or procurement of <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.7 This change will give us the data we need to understand how much is spent on <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> across government and from which funding streams. It will also allow us to identify the authorities which are able to maximise prevention spend through the grant, as a first step toward identifying effective interventions to improve shared learning across authorities.</p>

<p>5.8 We are keen that this change is implemented in a proportionate way, which minimises the potential administrative impact on authorities. We are interested to hear views on whether the definition of these categories are workable, whether there are other types of spend we have not listed above, the ability of local authorities to categorise spend in this way and any anticipated impacts this may have on homelessness teams.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>Q13.</strong> To what extent do you feel confident that local authorities would be able to provide a yearly spend declaration of HPG categorised under âprevention and reliefâ, âTAâ and âmain duty/otherâ?

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Introducing tranche payments with conditions</h2>

<h3>Background: <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data collection</h3>

<p>6.1 Local authorities in receipt of the Homelessness Prevention Grant are currently asked to submit data returns to <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> via the Homelessness Case Level Information Collection (<abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr>), which inform the statutory national homelessness statistics. This data provides invaluable insight into homelessness trends across England, providing case-level data on homeless households, including those in temporary accommodation. The statistics are used to track national and local progress on reducing homelessness, to drive performance, and to inform government policy.</p>

<p>6.2 The homelessness performance dashboard shows statistics indicating local authority homelessness performance and shows an overall RAG rating of the <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data provided: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGVmYTc2NTQtNWJiNi00NmFhLWIwM2YtNTQ4ZTdkYzQ1MmY0IiwidCI6ImJmMzQ2ODEwLTljN2QtNDNkZS1hODcyLTI0YTJlZjM5OTVhOCJ9" rel="external">Homelessness Performance Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>6.3 Most local authorities consistently provide high-quality <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> returns on time. However, there is room for improvement - a small but nonetheless sizeable proportion of authorities fail to provide complete or accurate returns, or do not provide the returns on time. In October â December 2021, 8% of local authorities failed to submit accurate <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> data (estimated to account for 21% of households in <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> in England), and 2% of local authorities supplied low quality <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data with over 15% of cases submitted with errors. This affects the overall quality of Englandâs homelessness statistics, and also risks the Homelessness Prevention Grant funding allocations not fully reflecting local pressures. Poor data reporting is particularly acute for certain datasets â such as for <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> figures.</p>

<p>6.4 Upon the implementation of <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr>, the government recognised that the change to reporting via <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> was significant, and has taken a phased approach over a number of years for this reason. The Homelessness Advice and Support Team (HAST), including expert advisers from local authorities and the sector seconded to <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>, have worked closely with local authorities to quality check data returns, and local authorities have been provided with Â£3m in targeted funding to support them to update their IT systems and comply with the data requirements. Given these measures, and the fact that <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> reporting requirements have now been in place for the past 5 years, we do not consider it reasonable that some local authorities are still failing to submit data appropriately.</p>

<h3>Introduction of tranche payments to drive better <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> data reporting</h3>

<p>6.5 In order to drive the performance of consistent <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> reporting, we propose to introduce tranche payments for the Homelessness Prevention Grant. This would be a change from the current system, whereby the entire yearâs funding is paid upfront in April. This proposal would mean that 75% of the funding would be released at the beginning of the financial year (tranche 1), and the remaining 25% would be released later in the financial year (tranche 2), on the condition that the local authority in question:</p>

<p>a. Has completed their Q2 <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> return, including full <abbr title="temporary accommodation">TA</abbr> figures, and</p>

<p>b. The data submitted is publishable (as defined by the fourth quality measure on the performance dashboard<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.6 Under this proposal, in order to receive the second tranche payment on time, the authority must have submitted their <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> return by the required deadline (within 6 weeks of the Q2 <abbr title="Homelessness Case Level Information Collection">H-CLIC</abbr> collection opening). If an authority misses the initial deadline but meets the above conditions in sufficient time to release payment before the end of the financial year, the authority would receive the second tranche payment after a period of delay. The local authority would not receive the second tranche of funding without meeting the conditions specified above.</p>

    In October 2021, DLUHC announced a one-off exceptional Â£65m top-up to the Homelessness Prevention Grant for 2022/23, to help households who were in rent arrears and struggling due to the impact of the pandemic. This additional funding was provided to local authorities in December 2021.<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">â©</a>

    Some homelessness funding is subject to departmental expenditure limits (DEL).
