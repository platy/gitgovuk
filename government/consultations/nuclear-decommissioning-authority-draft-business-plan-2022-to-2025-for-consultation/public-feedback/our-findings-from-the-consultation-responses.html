<h2>Activities and requests for more information on targets</h2>

<p>A number of respondents asked for more detailed targets to be included in the Plan. The Plan’s purpose is to provide a summary of activities and expected progress for our 17 nuclear sites over the next three years, in line with the funding agreed with HM Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). All the NDA group companies engage in their own operational planning which includes detailed targets, budgets, and key deliverables. These individual plans are subject to appropriate governance within the operating companies and are consolidated at a group level for reporting and measuring performance.</p>

<p>We continue to improve how we tell our story and how our mission flows into delivery on the ground. Pages 24-27 are where we have outlined our four strategic themes, which can be broken down into 47 outcomes. Our critical enablers’ page also describes the importance of these activities to our mission. We also commit to publish an annual Mission Progress Report which demonstrates delivery of our strategic themes and outcomes as explained in our Strategy.</p>

<h2>Engaging with our stakeholders</h2>

<p>During the consultation we received feedback that some stakeholders would like to be engaged earlier to take advantage of any opportunities for site level activities to align with local strategies. Some respondents also suggested we should enhance our use of social and digital media and make better use of virtual events and meetings.</p>

<p>We welcome this feedback and are committed to further improving the flexibility of our interactions to encourage more diverse discussions. Engaging openly and transparently with all our stakeholders is crucial to building the support, confidence and trust we need to deliver our mission.</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>A number of respondents asked for a more detailed split in expenditure. The intent of including expenditure figures is to outline planned allocations of available funding. The NDA operates a portfolio funding approach across the group and retains flexibility in final allocations through the year. This allows us to focus on our highest hazards and high risk areas, while maximising value for money. This means that it is not always appropriate to provide a more detailed split of the expenditure.</p>

<h2>Sustainability/Net Zero</h2>

<p>There was interest in this area from a number of respondents. We have a legal, moral, and ethical responsibility to deliver our mission sustainably, with care for our people, communities, and the environment. We have a renewed focus on sustainability and social value and are committed to supporting the UK and Welsh government target of carbon net zero by 2050 and the target of 2045 set by Scottish Government. More information on our current approach to sustainability can be found on page 32 and also in section 8.2 of our Strategy.</p>

<h2>Socio economics</h2>

<p>There was continued interest in the NDA’s work in this area and how it allocated budget for these activities. In 2020 we revised our approach to socio-economics in our Local Social and Economic Impact Strategy update and the revised guidance on how to apply for grants is available on our website.</p>

<p>We have also strengthened our reference to socio-economics with a case study on St Ola Pier, Scrabster Harbour.</p>

<p>We have a responsibility to support the sustainability of our sites’ communities up to and after their closure. This means working in partnership with local authorities and organisations to better understand local needs.</p>

<h2>Accelerated decommissioning of Magnox sites</h2>

<p>Following a review of the Magnox reactor decommissioning strategy (strategic outcome 42), the NDA has endorsed a site-specific approach to Magnox reactor decommissioning which will involve a mix of decommissioning strategies. The intention is that the site-specific strategies will result in a rolling programme of activity as the Magnox fleet is decommissioned.</p>

<p>The overall strategy and site-specific details will be published when appropriate governance and stakeholder engagement is complete.</p>

<h2>Transfer of AGR sites</h2>

<p>A number of respondents were interested in the UK Government’s decision to entrust the NDA group with a new, nationally important UK decommissioning programme. Once defueling and fuel free verification are complete, the ownership of seven EDF Energy advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) sites will transfer to the NDA over the next
decade for future decommissioning.</p>

<p>We recognise the importance of engaging with our stakeholders during the process to take ownership of these sites, in particular the site stakeholder groups and local authorities in host communities.</p>

<h2>Other minor changes in the Plan</h2>

<p>An update on the BEIS Departmental Review and Magnox Inquiry can be found in our CEO’s foreword.</p>
