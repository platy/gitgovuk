<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>Since 2012, a trial of longer semi-trailers (<abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>) of up to 15.65 metres has taken place on roads in Great Britain (GB), enabling 30 standard UK pallets to be transported in a trailer as opposed to 26, offering more efficiency and fewer lorry journeys for commodities limited by bulk as opposed to weight. This efficiency is further enhanced by a number of operators utilising double deck trailers.</p>

<p>The maximum length of a longer semi-trailer plus tractor unit is 18.55 metres, marginally shorter than road train combinations allowed in general circulation in the UK and mainland Europe. Until agreement is given that <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> can be used on international operations, they will be limited to use in the UK.</p>

<p>The ongoing <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> trial now involves around 2,600 <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. Up to the end of 2019 the trial results indicated that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on average, the use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> reduced journey numbers by 1 in 12, with more than 54 million vehicle kilometres saved</li>
  <li>48,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>(e) and 241 tonnes of <abbr title="Oxides of Nitrogen">NOx</abbr> have been saved</li>
  <li>on a per kilometre basis <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> have been involved in about 53% fewer personal injury collisions and casualties than the GB articulated heavy goods vehicle (<abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr>) average<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Mainly qualitative information suggests that practices in the trial such as specific driver training, operator practices (including route selection, route assessment, driver selection and driver familiarity) contribute to the better safety performance of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> per kilometre. An important issue in considering the more general use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> is how to ensure the safety performance remains as good as or better than standard trailers.</p>

<p>The consultation seeks evidence on the merits of 2 alternative packages of specific regulation for <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> (on top of the normal rules that apply to heavy goods vehicles). This regulation would be targeted towards requiring or encouraging practices such as route planning, data collection, incident reporting and driver training, to maintain higher productivity and safety performance.</p>

<p>The consultation also seeks views on the assessment that allowing <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> to operate outside trial conditions would lead to a substantial growth in their use. Projections suggest that in a decadeâs time about 16,000 <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> could be operating - approximately 8 to 10% of the UKâs domestic semi-trailer fleet.</p>

<p>The departmentâs preferred option is the lighter additional regulatory option, which on top of regulations applicable to standard heavy goods vehicles, proposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the requirement to report incidents involving an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> where a person is killed or injured whether this occurs on a public road or private land and incidents involving <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> only on public roads where damage is caused</li>
  <li>specific driver training, lasting a minimum of half a day, which could be provided by the operator, but which could also be done via periodic training for driver certificates of professional competence (<abbr title="driver certificates of professional competence">DCPC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>underpinning specific identification of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> in operator licensing</li>
  <li>the requirement for operators to undertake and retain a risk assessment of the proposed route an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> will follow and to have regard to and record feedback received from drivers on the appropriateness of routes</li>
  <li>operators will be required to undertake an appropriate level of compliance monitoring to ensure <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are being operated on the routes set and to take appropriate action where deviations are identified</li>
</ul>

<p>The assessed effects of this option, based on the retention of much of the trialâs superior productive and safety performance, including significant reductions in the vehicle kilometres travelled and the resulting overall environmental benefits.</p>

<p>This consultation also seeks evidence about a heavier additional regulatory option. On top of the lighter specific regulatory option, this option would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>require operators to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> on a defined network consisting of major roads (this includes all motorways and A roads) for a minimum of 80% of each journey an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> undertakes</li>
  <li>require drivers to undertake approved <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> <abbr title="Driver Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> training before their <abbr title="driver certificates of professional competence">DCPC</abbr> is renewed in order to retain entitled to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>require operators to be able to accurately track the routes <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> take by <abbr title="global positioning system">GPS</abbr>, and have a system in place to collect and store this data for a 5-year period. Operators would be required, should the police, Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) or Traffic Commissioners of Great Britain request such data, to provide the data in a required format to identify whether the 80% requirement is being achieved</li>
  <li>require operators to apply to the traffic commissioner on an annual basis for approval to continue to operate a <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> once the trailer is over 10 years old</li>
</ul>

<p>The assessed effects of this option indicate gains in productivity and safety over not having <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. However, there is less net gain to business than for the preferred option due to lower take-up and because of the added regulatory burden.</p>

<p>Additionally, this consultation also seeks evidence about allowing <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> to enter into general circulation without any extra specific regulatory controls. The <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> would operate under the normal regulatory regime for heavy goods vehicles, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the operator licensing regime overseen by the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain, with undertakings required to have transport managers, a good reputation and enough financial standing</li>
  <li>requirements for vehicle inspections and maintenance (usually at about 6-weekly intervals), plus the independent annual goods vehicle test</li>
  <li>drivers to have category C+E licences and <abbr title="driver certificates of professional competence">DCPC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The safety performance of this option is assessed as being similar to that of standard articulated lorries - and the average productivity increase as less than in the trial and the options with specific regulations. Nonetheless, there are substantial benefits for business and the public.</p>

<p>The reference case against which these options have been assessed is the current policy of continuing the trial until 2027, with a maximum of 2,800 <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. In this case no other <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> would be operated following the trial. This is also an entirely feasible option. If this option were taken forward the trial might then be closed to new <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The consultation also seeks evidence about the specific parts of the lighter and heavier additional regulatory options. A decision could be made to take forward parts of the options in different combinations. The consultation also seeks further evidence about the costs and other effects indicated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/933259/impact-assessment-longer-semi-trailer-trial.pdf" rel="external">impact assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence related to productivity and safety of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> is also sought through the consultation. Despite better average incident rates in the trial compared with lorries in normal operation, there have been (to date) 2 fatal incidents involving <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. Following investigation, neither of these cases appear to have been caused by factors related to the trailer being an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>.</p>

<p>The evaluation has also considered other technical issues, for example concluding that there has been no significant effect on rail freight volumes.</p>

<h2>Background and trial evaluation</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The Department for Transport has been operating a trial of longer semi-trailers (<abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>) since 2012. The trial is designed to evaluate the impact of <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> operations on efficiency, emissions and safety.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> is a semi-trailer with a length of either 14.6 metres or 15.65 metres. This is up to 2.05 metres longer than standard length trailers (13.6 metres) under construction and use regulations. An <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> has a maximum total vehicle length, including tractor unit, of 18.55 metres.</p>

<p>The trial began with an initial allocation available of 1,800 semi-trailers and to ensure that operators taking part could incur the expense of purchasing an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> and continue using it until the end of its expected useful life, the length of the trial was set at 10 years. In January 2017, the trial was extended by 5 years and an additional 1,000 <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> were permitted. All <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are required to operate under a vehicle special order (<abbr title="Vehicle Service Order">VSO</abbr>) granted by the Vehicle Certification Agency.</p>

<p>The main findings of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/longer-semi-trailer-trial-evaluation-annual-report-2019">2019 annual report</a> show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2,565 (90%) <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> were registered on <abbr title="Vehicle Service Orders">VSOs</abbr> with 2,473 (88%) of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> on the road and having submitted trial data</li>
  <li>54 to 60 million vehicle <abbr title="kilometres">km</abbr> were âsavedâ by <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> operations (end 2019)</li>
  <li>739 million <abbr title="kilometres">km</abbr> were travelled by <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> during the trial, estimated (2019) to be split: 85% trunk / 13% principal / 2% ,inor roads</li>
  <li>430,000 to 485,000 journeys by 13.6 metre trailers were saved by using <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> based on 125km average journey. Upper estimate (includes some return legs)</li>
  <li>1 in 12 (8%) journeys were saved as an average across all operators with the highest saving operators achieving a saving of 1 in 8 (13%)</li>
  <li>savings of 48,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> and 241 tonnes of <abbr title="Oxides of Nitrogen">NOx</abbr> 2012 to 2019 (rounded) were made</li>
  <li>on a per kilometre basis, nationally, we estimate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> have been involved in around 53% fewer personal injury collisions and casualties than the GB articulated <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> average</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/longer-semi-trailer-trial#progress-reports">Annual reports on the progress of the trial have been published since 2013</a>. The 2019 report is published alongside this consultation.</p>

<p>The Minister of State for Transport wrote in July 2019 to a selection of relevant stakeholders seeking informal views on the trial and how it should proceed. This asked specifically about what regulations could be suitable if <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> were to be permitted outside of trial conditions, and what restrictions stakeholders believed would be acceptable to address the potential risks associated with wider use. The views received have informed the consideration of the future of the trial.</p>

<p>The departmentâs view, informed by emerging conclusions from the trial, is that sufficient data is available to answer the key questions that the trial was designed to answer. It is therefore right that we consider whether to conclude the trial prior to 2027, and (if a decision is taken to do so) how to treat <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> beyond their current limited use.</p>

<p>This consultation sets out the governmentâs proposals for the future of the trial. However, it should be noted that, until a decision is taken and implemented, <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> will continue to operate under the current trial regime.</p>

<h3>Policy objectives</h3>

<p>The objective of this policy is to facilitate more efficient and environmentally beneficial freight transport. It seeks to permit the transportation of an equal amount of freight in fewer journeys by allowing longer vehicles, which will achieve an emission saving as fewer pollutants will be emitted during the transportation of the same amount of goods. It is also anticipated that this will have a positive benefit on congestion as fewer trips will be required.</p>

<p>The lighter and heavier additional policy options propose regulations, on top of those which currently exist for the operation of standard trailers, be put in place with the aim of supporting the safe and productive operation of these vehicles.</p>

<h3>Evaluation of the trial</h3>

<p>Risk Solutions were commissioned by the department at the commencement of the trial to undertake collection, analysis and evaluation of results during the trial. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/longer-semi-trailer-trial#progress-reports">Their work has been set out in the published annual reports</a>.</p>

<p>The objective of the trial is to provide evidence to the department to support long term policy decisions on the benefits of <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> semi-trailers. The annual reports set out 7 main evaluation questions that are considered in detail. Questions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>question 1: What do operators use <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> for?</li>
  <li>question 2: What are the savings realised in <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> journeys?</li>
  <li>question 3: What are the resulting reductions in emissions?</li>
  <li>question 4: What about safety - will <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> cause more injuries?</li>
  <li>question 5: What about damage and the associated costs - will <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> cause more damage on the roads?</li>
  <li>question 6: Might any special operational requirements be appropriate for <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>?</li>
  <li>question 7: What proportion of the existing GB fleet of semi-trailers might be replaced by <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, were numbers not restricted?</li>
</ul>

<p>The department considers that satisfactory answers to these questions have been established in the course of the evaluation including information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/longer-semi-trailer-trial-evaluation-annual-report-2018">2018</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/longer-semi-trailer-trial-evaluation-annual-report-2019">2019</a> annual reports.</p>

<h4>What do operators use <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> for?</h4>

<p>Data from operators has shown that <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are used for a wide range of activities, including transporting fast-moving consumer goods (<abbr title="fast moving consumer goods">FMCG</abbr>), other retail goods, raw materials and supplies, waste materials and industrial products. This has been largely consistent throughout the trial.</p>

<h4>What are the savings realised in <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> journeys?</h4>

<p>The second question explores what savings could be made compared to a standard (13.6 metre trailer) <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> operation. In this context, savings refers to the additional distance that would have to be operated if the same quantity of goods was transported by 13.6 metre trailers.</p>

<p>The average saving achieved by operators is 8% (1 in 12 journeys) with the most efficient operations saving 13% (1 in 8 journeys). This has been broadly consistent over time.</p>

<h4>What are the resulting reductions in emissions?</h4>

<p>Evaluation has been undertaken of the resulting emission reductions due to savings made in <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> journeys. Since the start of the trial, it has been estimated that emissions of 48,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e and 241 tonnes of <abbr title="Oxides of Nitrogen">NOx</abbr> have been avoided by the use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What about safety - will <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> cause more injuries?</h4>

<p>Establishing whether or not <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> will have a negative safety impact is an important part of the evaluation. This relates to 2 issues: the reduction in incidents arising from making fewer journeys, and the rate of safety incidents per kilometre compared to standard semi-trailers.</p>

<p>The first measure is an intrinsic benefit and follows from the journeys removed by the operation of longer semi-trailers. In respect to the second measure, under trial conditions, the casualty record is lower per lorry kilometre travelled than the operation of standard articulated lorries. However, in the trial lorries and <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are likely to be operated in a non-typical way. An important part of deciding what to do next involves considering how some good practices can be continued and risk controlled.</p>

<h4>What about damage and the associated costs - will <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> cause more damage on the roads?</h4>

<p>This question explores whether there would be additional damage caused by longer semi-trailers. Independent evaluators have undertaken a special study contrasting <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> damage incidents with damage incidents from the same operators non-<abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> fleet. This has involved 91 operators. This evaluation has indicated that <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are causing no more damage than standard semi-trailers operating in the same company fleet.</p>

<h4>Might any special operational requirements be appropriate for <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>?</h4>

<p>This question considers whether special operating requirements may be appropriate for <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> operation outside of a trial setting.</p>

<p>Conclusive answers to this question are difficult to fully establish during any trial, due to the impact that trial monitoring itself may have on behaviour by operators. However, we have involved operators in conversations about the most common operational conditions they have adopted, based on their experience operating <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. These conversations, as well as our understanding of the impact of trial conditions, have fed into the special operating requirements set out in the preferred policy proposals set out below. This work appears in the 2019 annual report which is published alongside this consultation. It is unlikely that further trial data collection would provide additional insight, unless the trial conditions were to significantly alter.</p>

<h4>What proportion of the existing GB fleet of semi-trailers might be replaced by <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, were numbers not restricted?</h4>

<p>This question seeks to explore what proportion of the GB fleet of semi-trailers may be replaced by <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> outside of a limited trial setting. Based on a 2016 to 2017 survey of operators, this has previously been estimated to be between 10 to 20%. However, this consultation seeks to garner a better understanding of potential operator decisions, were fleet decisions not affected by onerous trial conditions or quantity caps.</p>

<p>Beyond exploring this issue with operators via this consultation, no conclusive answer to this question can be gained under trial conditions that restrict <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> numbers.</p>

<h3>Feedback from stakeholders</h3>

<p>In July 2019, the Minister of State for Transport wrote to a number of relevant stakeholders to establish their views on a post-trial regime, and to gather views on potential future usage. Although only a limited number of responses were received, these views informed this consultation.</p>

<p>The results were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the majority of respondents viewed the use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> favourably and were keen to see the benefits of their use continue. This was not unanimous, with some concerns raised by some stakeholders in relation to road safety</li>
  <li>of those respondents who did view <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> favourably and gave views on their continued or expanded use, the majority emphasised the importance of maintaining the benefits observed and modelled during the trial and supported this as a policy goal</li>
  <li>the vast majority of respondents supported some form of regulatory regime, with the most popular options involving driver training, which was widely supported</li>
  <li>route selection and management was an area of concern, in particular the potential for longer semi-trailers to use unsuitable roads with potential impact on road furniture and wear. Although there was support for measures to mitigate these concerns, it was noted that this may largely be an issue for local authorities who currently cannot enforce transport regulation orders (TROs) and that auditing routes may be an additional expense</li>
</ul>

<h2>The future of the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> trial: options for consideration</h2>

<h3>Main options for consideration</h3>

<p>Given the findings of the research stated, the time is right to consider the future of the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> trial. There are several  options to conclude the trial and which have formed the basis of the accompanying impact assessment. The options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do nothing</li>
  <li>a light regulation approach</li>
  <li>a heavier regulation approach</li>
  <li>allowing <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> to enter into general circulation</li>
</ul>

<h4>Do nothing</h4>

<p>This option would see the trial continue as planned until the current end date, 31 January 2027. The cap of 2,800 vehicles would be maintained. Operators would continue to have to apply for an allocation of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> and be required to apply for a <abbr title="Vehicle Service Order">VSO</abbr> covering each <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> they wish to operate. Operators would also be required to continue to have to submit data returns every 4 months regarding each trailerâs status, journey data and incidents.</p>

<p>At the end of the trial, trailers would cease to be able to operate as the <abbr title="Vehicle Service Orders">VSOs</abbr> would expire and as it stands <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are not permitted under construction and use regulations. This may be before the end of a standard lifecycle for some trailers which have been purchased by operators at their own cost.</p>

<p>This option would not achieve the policy objectives but is included as a baseline against which the impacts of other options are estimated. If adopted the department would also consider formally closing the trial to new <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> at that stage.</p>

<h4>Lighter additional regulatory option</h4>

<p>This is the departmentâs preferred policy option as it allows the whole of the freight industry to have unrestricted access to <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> and therefore make an important contribution to reducing emission levels. The proposed additional regulation beyond that in place for standard 13.6 metre trailers, takes into consideration concerns raised regarding <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> being operated on inappropriate roads and increasing the road safety risk, particularly to vulnerable road users as well as damage to street furniture.</p>

<p>This option would remove the cap on the total number of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> permitted and would allow the market to decide the quantity in operation based on commercial need. To ensure the excellent safety record of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> operated under the trial is at least maintained this option proposes that the regulatory measures of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accident reporting to the department where there is loss of life, injury (on public or private land) or damage (when on a public highway)</li>
  <li>operators being required to provide drivers with a minimum of half a dayâs training in respect to the particular <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> design before a driver operates an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> for the first time. This will need repeating or enhancing if a driver uses another <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> design. If providing this training in house, operators will be required to have regard to an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> best practice training guide</li>
  <li>operators being required to undertake a risk assessment of the proposed route for the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> to ensure it is appropriate</li>
  <li>operators being required to retain a record of all risk assessments undertaken prior to <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> journeys and make them available to the police, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Office of the Traffic Commissioners">OTC</abbr> or traffic commissioner on request</li>
  <li>operators will be required to put in place a system to allow drivers to provide feedback on routes proposed and followed. A record of this feedback and response provided by the operator will be required to be kept on record for 5 years</li>
  <li>operators being required to undertake compliance checks to ensure <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are following the routes set and to take appropriate action where deviations are identified. A written record of compliance checks will be required to be kept for 5 years</li>
  <li>operators being required to apply to the traffic commissioner for permission to operate a permitted number of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>operators being required to ensure that there is a process for managing road closures (planned or emergency) to assist drivers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Heavier additional regulatory option</h4>

<p>This option adds further specific regulations to the previous option. This option would require operators to run each <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> at least 80% of each journey on the major roads. In order to achieve this, operators would be required to ensure appropriate route planning is undertaken before each journey. Operators would be required to undertake an appropriate level of compliance checks to ensure this requirement was being achieved.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with the 80% requirement, operators will be required to be able to accurately track the route <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> take by <abbr title="global positioning system">GPS</abbr> and have a system in place to collect and store this data for five years. Operators will be required, should the police, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>, or the traffic commissioner request such data, to provide the data in the required format to identify whether the 80% requirement is being achieved.</p>

<p>In addition to the training requirements set out in the lighter additional regulations proposal drivers will be required to also undertake approved <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> <abbr title="Driver Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> training before their <abbr title="driver certificates of professional competence">DCPC</abbr> is required to next be renewed in order to retain entitled to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Operators wishing to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> over 10 years of age would be required to apply to the traffic commissioner on an annual basis for approval to continue to operate the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Allowing <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> to enter into general circulation</h4>

<p>This option proposes that <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> should be allowed to operate under the same restrictions as standard trailers do, therefore placing no additional regulatory burden on operators. Operators would not be required to apply to the traffic commissioner for specific authority to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. They would only be required to make an application to the traffic commissioner if they did not have sufficient capacity on their operatorâs license and wished to increase the number of trailers operated on the license.</p>

<p>Under this option, drivers operating <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> would still need to undertake appropriate training, but no minimum time would be put in place for how long such training should last, nor would they be required to have regard to a best practice training guide.</p>

<h3>Specific issues to resolve</h3>

<h4>Number of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> permitted to be used</h4>

<p>The departmentâs view is that it is now appropriate to consider whether to widen the permitted use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> and increase or remove the quantity limit. Given the findings of the research as set out above, the time is right to consider the future of the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> trial. However, the use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> would not be beneficial in all types of operation and given their higher purchase and maintenance cost, it is not expected that they would wholly supplant 13.6 metre trailers. The management of significant safety concerns raised by the trial is also another significant factor in considering whether to continue to control the numbers of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> in operation.</p>

<p>For these reasons we propose not to limit the number of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> outside of the current trial setting in any of the options that include ending the trial early.</p>

<h4>Data required to be collected by operators</h4>

<p>At present, operators must submit data every 4 months including, summary information for the journeys by each trailer, total mileage, and classification of goods type. However, individual trip reports are currently not required. The current arrangements are appropriate within a trial setting. However, if utilised after the current trial, would carry significant cost to industry and the department and would likely reduce take up of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, it has been noted that some of the benefits seen within a trial setting may be linked to the requirement for operators to collect data, giving them access to knowledge of fleet utilisation which may not have otherwise been available.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we are seeking views on 2 levels of post-trial data collection.</p>

<p>The lighter additional regulatory option proposes that operators be required to  undertake a risk assessment of the route the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> will take to ensure the route proposed is appropriate for an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> to follow. A record of all risk assessments undertaken prior to journeys undertaken by <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, any feedback received from drivers either prior to or after a route has been followed and the response by the operator to such feedback will be required to be kept for 5 years and provided if requested to do so by the police, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>, or traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>The heavier additional regulatory option proposes that operators be required to fulfil the data requirements of the light regulatory burden option outlined above, and in addition run each <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> at least 80% of each journey on the major roads and requires operators to be able to accurately record by <abbr title="global positioning system">GPS</abbr> the route each <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> takes for each journey, and retain that record for five years. Operators will be required, should the police, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> or the traffic commissioner request such data, to provide the data in a required format to identify whether the 80% requirement is being achieved.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>-specific driver training requirements</h4>

<p>Under the current trial the operator undertaking agreement requires operators to provide appropriate training to drivers before they drive <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. It is possible that one of the biggest impacts on the safety record of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> is the fact that specific training is required prior to operating an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>.</p>

<p>The proposal under both the lighter and heavier additional regulatory options is for a requirement for specific driver training prior to operation of an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>. In the lighter additional regulatory option, operators would be required to provide drivers with training before they are able to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. There would be a requirement that this specific training lasts a minimum of half a day and that operators would follow a <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> best practice training guidance document when considering what training they would l provide to their drivers.</p>

<p>Operators would also be expected, where a driver of an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> is involved in an incident, to consider whether both the driver involved in the incident and all other drivers entitled to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> should undertake further training or be provided with information about the incident to minimise the risk of the incident happening again.</p>

<p>In the heavier regulatory option drivers would in addition, be required by the point of <abbr title="driver certificates of professional competence">DCPC</abbr> renewal, to have undertaken an approved <abbr title="Driver Certificate of Professional Competence">CPC</abbr> <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> course in order to retain the right to operate <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Incident reporting required by operators</h4>

<p>Consideration has been given to the appropriate level of incident reporting, to avoid introducing disproportionate requirements which could reduce usage of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> unnecessarily. Given the significant public concern relating to the safety of longer heavier vehicles in general, the department considers it would be appropriate to maintain oversight of any continuing safety risk after introduction of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> more widely.</p>

<p>The department proposes that under both the lighter and heavier additional regulatory options that operators be required to continue reporting incidents that result in a loss of life or injury on public roads or private land. Operators will also be required to continue to report incidents which result in damage being caused where such incidents take place on a public road. This data will be held by the department and could form useful information relating to the risks posed by the operation of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> and allow for review of the safety measures in our proposals. Where concerns become evident these may then be acted on through existing enforcement mechanisms.</p>

<h4>Controls on usage of specific road types</h4>

<p>Consideration has been given to controlling the use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> on certain roads, given that the additional length and manoeuvring requirements may make them unsuitable for some journeys. The current requirement to consider route planning may have impacted the proportion of individual journeys undertaken on major roads. Given the departmentâs objectives of ensuring the safe and efficient use of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, our proposals seek to maintain this.</p>

<p>As part of both the light and heavy additional regulatory option it is proposed operators will be required to undertake a risk assessment of the route it is proposed the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> will take. A record of this risk assessment would be required to be retained for 5 years. Operators will be required to put in place a system to allow drivers to provide feedback on routes proposed/followed. A record of this feedback and response provided by the operator would be required to be kept on record for 5 years. Operators would be required to make such records available on request to the police, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> or traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>The heavier additional regulatory option would additionally include a requirement that 80% of all <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> journeys be undertaken using major roads. In order to enforce this requirement, operators will be required to accurately track by <abbr title="global positioning system">GPS</abbr> the routes <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> take and have a system in place to collect and store this data for 5 years. Operators will be required, should the police, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> or traffic commissioner request such data, to provide the data in a required format to identify whether the 80% requirement is being achieved.</p>

<h4>Specific operator licencing requirements for <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> operators</h4>

<p>We propose that the operation of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> would require specific authority from the traffic commissioner under the current operator licencing regime. This recognises the unique and specialist nature of these trailers and the different challenges with operating them. It would enable a record to be kept of all operators using <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Vehicle specification: <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> specific construction and use requirements</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/longer-semi-trailers-guidance-on-the-technical-requirements">Extensive technical requirements relating to <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> to be utilised on the trial</a> are available. In considering the future usage of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, we have considered whether any technical requirements should be amended.</p>

<p>Kick-out and tail swing of the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> has been raised as an area of concern, and is recognised as a potential safety risk. There is insufficient evidence to show that one form of trailer or axle poses a greater risk than others and work by the department has not resulted in a clear recommendation about maximum kick-out. The department does not propose placing additional specific limits on kick-out but would require that the potential for kick-out or tail swing is covered extensively in driver training (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#driver-training"><abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>-specific driver training requirements</a>) taking into account the specific <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> designs in use by the company.</p>

<p>Technical requirements for <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> may be altered for those introduced to the market, depending on responses to this consultation. However, the department would not propose immediate disposal of existing <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>. If any trailers currently on the trial did not fit any new requirements the proposed presumption would be to allow the trial conditions to be retained for them until the expiry of current approvals.</p>

<h4>Utilising existing <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>: maximum trailer age</h4>

<p>As part of the lighter additional regulatory option we the department does not propose putting any limit on the life of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> or any risk management plan when the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> reaches a certain age.</p>

<p>Under the heavier additional regulatory option, operators would be required to apply to the traffic commissioner on an annual basis for approval to continue to operate a <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> once the trailer reaches 10 years old. This requirement would help ensure the expected efficiency benefits continue to be achieved, partly once <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> have been sold on the second-hand market in order to ensure that they do not become the default in operation thereby replacing the operation of 13.6 metre trailers by a large portion of the industry.</p>

<h2>Forecasts of future operation</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> in operation and kilometres saved</h3>

<p>The use of the scaling model has allowed us to forecast the number of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> we would expect in operation based on the average kilometres saved per <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> observed in the trial. These have been summarised in 5 yearly periods in the table below for each option.</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>Introducing longer semi-trailers onto roads in Great Britain would reduce the overall number of articulated HGVs on the road through a smaller total number of trucks on the road and fewer vehicle kilometres travelled. This can lower the likelihood of a road traffic accident involving a <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> and therefore a reduction in the number of casualties per year.</p>

<p>During the trial, this saving has been estimated and reported annually as being in direct proportion to the number of kilometres saved. Although <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> are expected to reduce the number of vehicles and therefore kilometres travelled, this may free up drivers to use other vehicles and increase productivity for operators. Therefore, the safety considerations only look at the direct effects of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> replacing standard trailers with everything else held constant.</p>

<p>Various controls can be used to mitigate against the risk of an increased casualty rate. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operating standards â operator licensing requirements, qualifications, driver training</li>
  <li>controlled trial conditions â replicating route assessment conditions from the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> trial</li>
</ul>

<p>An issue considered in the trail was that given the longer length of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, there may be additional risks to pedestrians and cyclists where <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> operate which may be more pronounced in urban areas. Over the course of the trial, operators have submitted accident reports to the department whenever an incident occurs which resulted in an injury or damage only incident. Summaries of these reports have been included in the annual reporting process, providing an indication of the severity, a description of the incident and those involved and determination if it was caused by the <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> specifically.</p>

<p>Up to the end of 2019, there had been 40 reported incidents involving an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> reported to the department, 3 of which have involved either a cyclist or a pedestrian. These are described in further detail below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2015 where an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> hit a pedestrian with the tail end of the trailer while making a turning manoeuvre in an urban location during a driver assessment (rather than a delivery). This resulted in a âslightâ injury and judged to be caused by the longer length of the vehicle. The route is no longer used for driver assessment</li>
  <li>2016 where an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> hit a cyclist from behind when moving from slip road to dual carriageway. This resulted in a âseriousâ injury which was judged to be not <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr>-related, in that the event would or could have still happened if the trailer had been a standard one</li>
  <li>2019 which resulted in the death of a cyclist, where the cyclist fell off while an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> was overtaking. From engagement with the police, it is judged that this being an <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> (as opposed to a standard trailer) was not to be the cause of this incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Further to this, we commissioned the consultant Risk Solutions to consider the collision rates for <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> when compared to the standard articulated <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> to determine the overall impact. Based on this analysis, the following collision rates were calculated:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Casualty rates per billion vehicle kilometres</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Articulated <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> (2012-2018)</td>
      <td>11.27</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
<abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> (2012-2019)</td>
      <td>4.02</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>From this, it can be inferred that the casualty rate with <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> appears to be lower than the corresponding articulated <abbr title="heavy goods vehicle">HGV</abbr> fleet average casualty rate, though this is based on a very small sample size. This will be examined in further detail during any post-implementation review.</p>

<p>The preferred option is the lighter additional regulatory option. This option allows the whole of the freight industry to have unrestricted access to <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> where operators identify that <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> could be of benefit to their business and so ensure the industry makes an important contribution to reducing emission levels.</p>

<p>This would include reducing or even eliminating most of the regulation and monitoring of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> currently required under the trial on the basis that the environmental and economic case for operators using <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> in certain circumstances has been proven. Maintaining such reporting requirements would only discourage operators when there are both business and societal benefits in operating <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This option is designed to support maintaining a good safety record for <abbr title="longer semi-trailer">LST</abbr> operation. The trial has shown that operators are individually able to identify and provide the training they feel their drivers require to understand the unique operating characteristics of <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>, good route planning, risk assessment and compliance checking to ensure <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr>â are operated at least as safely as standard articulated trailers. Given the success under the trial of the training that has been provided to drivers operating <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> (shown by <abbr title="longer semi-trailers">LSTs</abbr> very favourable safety record), the option seeks to broadly replicate what has been done in the trial.</p>
