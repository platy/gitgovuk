<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>With so much more of our lives lived online, devices such as mobile phones now hold large volumes of information about us, some of which is highly sensitive and personal. When someone is a complainant or a witness to a crime there may be crucial information on a device that could help to bring someone to justice.</p>

<p>The invasive nature of the process around disclosure of this digital information has long been raised as an issue by victims and can stop someone from reporting a crime or continuing with a prosecution.  It is vital that victims and witnesses are confident they will be treated with sensitivity and dignity when reporting crimes and that their rights to privacy are protected so that more victims feel able to come forward.</p>

<p>That is why I have introduced, in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, new statutory powers to govern the practice of extraction information from electronic devices. This Act completed Parliamentary passage in April and creates a clear statutory basis for police and other authorities to extract this information with the agreement of a device user. These powers contain important safeguards that prioritise the privacy of the individual and ensure any request to obtain information from a victim or witness is necessary and proportionate.</p>

<p>The use of the powers will be supported by a code of practice, and it is this guidance which I now seek views on. The draft code has a number of important functions and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>detailed guidance on when and how these powers should be used and the considerations when making assessments of necessity and proportionality including where there is a risk of obtaining either confidential information or information which may not be necessary for the purpose for which the powers are being exercised</li>
  <li>an overview of the existing responsibilities for authorised persons under the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act</li>
  <li>guidance on ensuring a device is provided voluntarily by a user (or on behalf of the user) and with their agreement to the extraction of information</li>
  <li>specific guidance on the use of the powers with children and adults without capacity</li>
  <li>detailed guidance about the use of the powers with victims who may be vulnerable due to the trauma they have experienced and who may need more support to make decisions about issues that affect them, such as whether to provide agreement to the extraction of information from their device</li>
</ul>

<p>These new powers and the code of practice present an opportunity to drive real cultural change in the way information belonging to complainants and witnesses is obtained, putting an individual’s right to privacy at the centre of the decision-making process.</p>

<p><strong>Rt Hon Kit Malthouse MP</strong></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Getting to this stage</h3>

<p>The Government introduced, in Part 2, Chapter 3 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, new statutory powers for the extraction of information from electronic devices. These powers provide authorised persons with a clear legal basis in which devices can be examined in a limited number of scenarios where strict criteria has been met. This is needed to limit the amount of sensitive personal information being extracted from devices belonging to victims and witnesses and to better protect the privacy of these individuals.</p>

<p>The power in section 37 of the Act allows authorised persons to extract information stored on a device used by a victim or witness when it has been voluntarily provided and agreement has been given that information can be extracted. This power may only be exercised for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating, or prosecuting crime, helping to locate a missing person, or protecting a child or an at-risk adult from neglect or physical, mental, or emotional harm. The power in section 41 of the Act allows authorised persons to extract information from a device where a person who was a user of the device has died and, immediately before they died, they were a user of the device. This power may be exercised for the purposes of certain investigations or inquests into the person’s death.</p>

<p>These powers strengthen the law to ensure that there is a consistent approach to requesting information from phones and other electronic devices, and that in all cases, requests to complainants and witnesses are necessary and proportionate.</p>

<p>The PCSC Act creates a requirement for the Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice on the lawful use of these powers. This code will give clear guidance for all authorities exercising these powers. Amongst other things, the code will address assessing if use of the powers is necessary and proportionate and how to ensure agreement is freely given and the device user’s rights are understood. All authorised persons have a duty to have regard to the code when exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, the power. The code is admissible in evidence in criminal or civil proceedings and failure to act in accordance with it may be taken into account by a court.</p>

<p>We published the first draft of the code in July 2021 to support Parliamentary scrutiny of the extraction of information clauses and an updated draft in the autumn to reflect further feedback from stakeholders, interested groups and the Government during the Bill’s passage up to that point.</p>

<p>The draft of the code of practice published for this consultation reflects the final clauses contained in the PCSC Act, and continued consultation with the bodies affected and other interested groups.</p>

<p>In preparing the draft code we have consulted extensively with civil society organisations, the law enforcement community and technical experts, the Information Commissioner’s Office, the Victim’s Commissioner for England and Wales and the Devolved Administrations of Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>What is the Code of Practice?</h2>

<p>Chapter 3, Part 2 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 establishes for the first time, a clear statutory basis for the extraction of information from electronic devices with the agreement of the device user, and introduces safeguards to protect the privacy of victims, witnesses, and others.</p>

<p>The new powers and the code of practice will ensure that there is a consistent approach to requesting the information from phones and other electronic devices, and that in all cases, requests to victims and witnesses are necessary and proportionate. The code also makes clear that the powers should only be used as last resort.</p>

<p>The code sets out the processes and safeguards governing the use of the extraction powers by law enforcement agencies, including the police. The new powers and the code introduce a set of strict criteria that limit the amount of sensitive personal information that can be extracted from the devices used by complainants and witnesses. The code gives detail on how the relevant powers should be used, including examples of best practice. It is intended to provide detailed guidance on the lawful use of these powers and to ensure the highest standards of professionalism and compliance with this legislation. The code also provides a summary of some of the relevant Human Rights and Data Protection requirements and considerations. It does not replace other codes of practice or guidance for other legislation.</p>

<p>The code is intended to guide those law enforcement and public authorities which can exercise the powers under Part 2, Chapter 3 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, but may also be useful to other agencies and professionals who support victims and witnesses.</p>

<h2>Why are we consulting?</h2>

<p>Under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, the Secretary of State is required to prepare a code of practice containing guidance about the powers in sections 37(1) and 41(1) of the Act.</p>

<p>In preparing the code, the Secretary of State must consult:</p>

<p>(a) the Information Commissioner</p>

<p>(b) the Scottish Ministers</p>

<p>(c) the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland</p>

<p>(d) the Commissioner of Victims and Witnesses</p>

<p>(e) the Domestic Abuse Commissioner</p>

<p>(f) the Commission for Victims and Survivors for Northern Ireland, and</p>

<p>(g) such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate</p>

<p>We are taking the opportunity to consult the bodies listed above as well as all who may be affected by these powers.</p>

<p>Following consultation, the Secretary of State will consider any representations made about the draft code. The code will be laid before Parliament before it can come into effect.</p>
