<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>1. This Code of Practice relates to the exercise of powers in Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (“the Act”). It should be read alongside the explanatory notes for Chapter 3 of Part 2. This Code is issued pursuant to section 42 of the Act, which provides that the Secretary of State must prepare a Code of Practice containing guidance about the exercise of the powers in sections 37(1) and 41(1). These powers allow authorised persons to extract information stored on electronic devices in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>2. This Code applies to all authorised persons named in Schedule 3 to the Act. It is a publicly available document and should be readily accessible by any authorised persons who may wish to review it<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>3. This Code of Practice provides practical guidance to authorised persons on the use of the powers, including how they should determine the correct legal power to use in the circumstances and how they should confirm that extraction of information is necessary and proportionate. This is needed to ensure that authorities exercise their functions in accordance with the law and protect the privacy of victims and witnesses. This Code will ensure a greater understanding of the use of the powers and their application.</p>

<p>4. This Code does not supersede guidance/codes that accompany other pieces of legislation, and only applies as regards the powers in Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Act. If another power is being used as the basis for extracting evidence from an electronic device, the guidance/code for that power will apply.</p>

<p>5. The power in section 37 of the Act allows authorised persons to extract information stored on an electronic device if a user of the device has voluntarily provided the device and agreed to the extraction of information from it<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The power may be exercised for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting crime<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>; helping to locate a missing person, or protecting a child or an at-risk adult<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> from neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm. Section 38 deals with the application of section 37 in cases where a user of a device is a child or adult without capacity. Section 40 deals with the application of section 37 in three special cases, including where a person who was a user of the device is missing, that person was a user of the device immediately before they went missing and an authorised person reasonably believes that that person’s life is at risk, or there is a risk of serious harm to that person.</p>

<p>6. The power in section 41 of the Act allows authorised persons to extract information stored on an electronic device if a person who was a user of the device has died and, immediately before they died, they were a user of the device. This power may be exercised for the purposes of certain investigations or inquests into the person’s death<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>7. Section 44 of, and Schedule 3 to, the Act set out who is an authorised person:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Part 1 of Schedule 3 names those authorised persons who may exercise either power for any specified purpose</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 2 of Schedule 3 names those authorised persons who may exercise the section 37 power for any specified purpose (these authorised persons may not exercise the section 41 power)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 3 of Schedule 3 names those authorised persons who may only exercise the power in section 37 for the purposes of the prevention detection, investigation or prosecution of crime (these authorised persons may not exercise the section 37 power for other purposes or the section 41 power)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8. An authorised person may only exercise the section 37 power for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting crime if they reasonably believe that information stored on the device is relevant to a reasonable line of enquiry which is being, or is to be, pursued by an authorised person.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>9. In a case where the authorised person proposes to exercise the section 37 power to help locate a missing person, or for the purposes of protecting a child or an at-risk adult from neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm, the authorised person must reasonably believe that the information stored on the device is relevant to that purpose.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>10. In any case, the authorised person must be satisfied that the exercise of the section 37 or 41 power is necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the person proposes to exercise the power. Where an authorised person thinks that there is a risk of obtaining excess information, the exercise of the power will only be proportionate if they are satisfied that (i) there is no other means of obtaining the information sought which avoid that risk, or (ii) there are such other means, but it is not reasonably practicable to use them.</p>

<p>11. Section 39 sets out the requirements that must be met for an individual to be treated as having voluntarily provided a device and agreed to the extraction of information from it (for the purposes of section 37 or 38). These requirements ensure that individuals are not placed under undue pressure and are given written notice of their right to refuse, and of the reason for, and details of, the request.</p>

<h3>Effect of the Code</h3>

<p>12. When using or deciding whether to use the section 37 power or the section 41 power, an authorised person must have regard to this Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>13. A failure on the part of an authorised person to act in accordance with the Code does not of itself render the person liable to any criminal or civil proceedings. However, the Code is admissible in evidence in criminal or civil proceedings, and a court may take into account a failure to act in accordance with the Code in determining any question in the proceedings (e.g., on the admissibility of evidence extracted from an electronic device)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>14. Failure to comply with this Code could result in a report being made to the Information Commissioner<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> and could also be considered in professional disciplinary hearings.</p>

<h3>What this Code does not cover</h3>

<p>15. This Code does not contain guidance about the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>other sections of the Act (that is, sections other than those contained in Chapter 3 of Part 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extraction of information from a device using coercive or compulsory powers such as a search warrant, production order or statutory notice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>covert extraction of information from a device – for example, where it is necessary as part of the investigation to obtain evidence from a device without a user’s knowledge</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 2: Human Rights and Data Protection</h2>

<p>16. Both the section 37 power and the section 41 power must be exercised in accordance with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>European Convention on Human Rights (‘the ECHR’) (including Article 8)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Protection Act 2018 (‘the DPA’)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK General Data Protection Regulation (‘the UK GDPR’)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The European Convention on Human Rights</h3>

<p>17. Article 8 of the ECHR sets out that everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, home, and correspondence. It goes on to state that there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society, inter alia, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>18. The authorised person must carefully consider (i) whether the extraction of information in pursuance of the powers will amount to an interference with the exercise of a person’s rights under Article 8, and (ii) if so, whether that interference is justifiable (bearing in mind the test set out in Article 8 and summarised above).</p>

<p>19. Electronic devices such as mobile phones are almost certain to contain sensitive information about the individual device user and their family and friends. The authorised person should consider the impact of intrusion into the private life of the individual and their contacts at all points in the decision-making process – when determining what information is needed to support a reasonable line of enquiry (where applicable), and in determining if the use of these powers is necessary, proportionate and that there are no other, less intrusive means of accessing the required information. Further detail on obligations to protect the privacy of device users that must be considered before using the powers can be found in Part 3 of this Code.</p>

<p>20. In addition to considering Article 8, authorised persons must also consider Article 6 of the ECHR – the right to a fair trial – and how the information sought may impact on that right.</p>

<h3>The Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation</h3>

<p>21. The two different data ‘processing’ regimes of the DPA and UK GDPR must be carefully considered, and the relevant regime must be complied with. When deciding which regime applies, consideration should be given to the primary purpose for the processing. If the primary purpose for processing is law enforcement,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> then Part 3 of the DPA will apply, otherwise Part 2 of the DPA read with the UK GDPR will apply.</p>

<p>22. Article 4 of the UK GDPR defines ‘processing’ as meaning “any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction”.</p>

<h3>Data processing for law enforcement purposes</h3>

<h4>General overview of DPA responsibilities</h4>

<p>23. Part 3 of the DPA outlines six data protection principles which must be complied with when processing data for law enforcement purposes, including when exercising these powers, summarised below.</p>

<p>(1) The processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair.</p>

<p>(2) The law enforcement purpose for which personal data is collected on any occasion must be specified, explicit and legitimate, and personal data so collected must not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected.</p>

<p>(3) Personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it is processed.</p>

<p>(4) Personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the law enforcement purpose for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without delay.</p>

<p>(5) Personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it is processed.</p>

<p>(6) Personal data processed for any of the law enforcement purposes must be so processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (and, in this principle, “appropriate security” includes protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage).</p>

<p>24. Authorised persons should refer to their own guidance on responsibilities under the DPA.</p>

<p>25. When the power in section 37 of the Act is used for the extraction of information for law enforcement purposes, for example preventing, detecting, investigating, or prosecuting crime, the authorised person must comply with Part 3 of the DPA<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>26. The DPA states that the processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair. It also states that the processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes is lawful only if and to the extent that it is based on law, and either;</p>

<p>(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for that purpose, or</p>

<p>(b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for that purpose by a competent authority.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>27. Section 35 of the DPA also applies when processing for law enforcement purposes is ‘sensitive processing’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. In these circumstances, the processing is permitted only in the two cases set out in subsections (4) and (5).</p>

<p>(4) The first case is where—</p>

<p>(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing for the law enforcement purpose, and</p>

<p>(b) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>(5) The second case is where—</p>

<p>(a) the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose,</p>

<p>(b) the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8, and</p>

<p>(c) at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<p>28. The Information Commissioner’s Office report on ‘Mobile phone data extraction by police forces’,[^18] concludes that consent is highly unlikely to be an appropriate condition for processing due to the standards that need to be met and that it would be more appropriate to rely on the condition that the extraction is strictly necessary for a law enforcement purpose than consent. This is because of the challenges in ensuring that the person providing consent understands how their data is going to be processed, because of the imbalance of power between the police and the individual that may make it hard for the person to refuse consent, and because consent cannot always be withdrawn. It is a requirement of UK data protection legislation that data subjects have the right to withdraw consent at any time. This would not always be possible where data has been extracted and as a result there is a lawful requirement upon the investigator to reveal the material to a Crown Prosecutor, for example where the material is capable of undermining, or materially weakens the prosecution case, or where it strengthens or assists the defence case. Further, it is unlikely that all of those who must provide consent under UK data protection legislation would be able to do so, as material on the device may relate to many individuals. In these circumstances, the data subjects may not be easily identifiable, or it would be impracticable to do so due to the volume of the material.</p>

<p>29. For ‘sensitive processing’ for law enforcement purposes, as defined in the DPA, you must be able to demonstrate that the processing is ‘strictly necessary’ and that you can satisfy one of the conditions in Schedule 8. This is a requirement that will not be met if you can achieve the purpose by some other reasonable means.</p>

<h3>Data processing for non-law enforcement purposes</h3>

<p>31. When the power in section 37 or in section 41 of the Act is used for non-law enforcement purposes – for example, to help locate a missing person, to protect a child or an at-risk adult from neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm (where no criminal element exists), or for the purposes of certain non-criminal investigations or inquests into the person’s death<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>, – the authorised person must comply with the UK GDPR<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>(read with Part 2 of the DPA). When extracting information for non-law enforcement purposes, the seven principles under Article 5<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> of the UK GDPR need to be met and Article 6<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> of the UK GDPR defines the lawful basis on which you can process the data. Article 9 of the UK GDPR also applies when processing ‘special category data’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Exercise of these powers</h2>

<h3>Section 37: the power and the purposes for which it may be exercised</h3>

<p>32. The power in section 37 requires that a user of the device has voluntarily provided it to an authorised person and has agreed to the extraction of information from it<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>. Where the power is being exercised for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting crime, this will commonly be a victim of, or a witness to, a crime. However, there is no barrier to a suspect or person of interest handing over their device and agreeing to the extraction of information from it.</p>

<p>33. If a device has multiple users, it is the responsibility of the authorised person to ensure that the person volunteering the device and agreeing to the extraction of information from it, is a user of that device.</p>

<p>34. In many instances, if the person is a suspect and the authorised person wishes to seize the device to prevent loss or destruction of evidence, then it is likely that a coercive power will be more appropriate. It is for the authorised person to determine in every instance what is the appropriate power depending on the circumstances – not just when the person is a suspect.</p>

<p>35. The power in section 37 may also be used for the purposes of helping to locate a missing person.</p>

<p>36. Before exercising the section 37 power to help locate a missing person, an authorised person should consult their relevant organisational guidelines.</p>

<p>37. The power in section 37 may also be used to protect a child or an at-risk adult from neglect or physical, mental, or emotional harm. An adult is at-risk if the authorised person reasonably believes that the adult is experiencing, or at risk of, neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm, and is unable to protect themselves against that neglect or harm (or risk of it).</p>

<h3>Section 41: the power and the purposes for which it may be exercised</h3>

<p>38. The power in section 41 may be used where a person who was a user of the device has died and, immediately before they died, they were a user of the device. The power may be exercised for the purposes of an investigation into the person’s death under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (England and Wales), an inquest into the person’s death under the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 or an investigation into the person’s death by the Lord Advocate (Scotland). This includes determining whether such an investigation or inquest should take place.</p>

<p>39. This is separate to the power in section 37 which may also be used where a person has died provided the conditions in section 37 are met.</p>

<h4>Reasonable belief that the information on the device is relevant</h4>

<p>40. An authorised person may only exercise the section 37 power for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating, or prosecuting crime if they reasonably believe that information on the device is relevant to a reasonable line of enquiry.</p>

<p>41. In the case where the authorised person proposes to exercise the section 37 power to help locate a missing person, or for the purposes of protecting a child or an at-risk adult from neglect or physical, mental or emotional harm, the authorised person must reasonably believe that information stored on the device is relevant to that purpose.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<p>42. In the case where the authorised person proposes to exercise the section 41 power for the purposes of an investigation into the person’s death under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (England and Wales), an inquest into the person’s death under the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 or an investigation into the person’s death by the Lord Advocate (Scotland), or to determine whether such an investigation or inquest should take place, the authorised person must reasonably believe that information stored on the device is relevant to a purpose with section 41(2) (a) to (c) of the Act.</p>

<p>43. The test as to what is ‘reasonable belief’ is an objective one. Any decision to extract information from a device should be made having considered all pertinent information available at the time, taking into account the provenance and the accuracy of the information available and based on more than suspicion.</p>

<p>44. Where the section 37 power is used for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime, authorised persons are bound by the following, relevant guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In England and Wales, the Code of Practice made under section 23 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (‘the CPIA’). This places a duty on investigators in England and Wales to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry whether they point towards or away from the suspect.</li>
</ul>

<p>As noted in the Attorney General’s Disclosure Guidelines 2020, what is ‘reasonable’ will depend on the context of the case. Paragraph 17 states “What is ‘reasonable’ will depend on the context of the case. A fair investigation does not mean an endless investigation. Investigators and disclosure officers should give thought to defining and articulating the limits of the scope of their investigations. When assessing what is reasonable, thought should be given as to what is likely to be obtained as a result of the line of enquiry and how it can be obtained. An investigator may seek the advice of the prosecutor when considering which lines of enquiry should be pursued where appropriate”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Scotland, the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 applies. A statutory <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.copfs.gov.uk/images/Documents/Prosecution_Policy_Guidance/Guidelines_and_Policy/Code%20of%20Practice%20-%20Disclosure%20of%20Evidence%20in%20Criminal%20Proceedings.pdf" rel="external">Code of Practice</a> has been published under section 164 of that Act.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Code of Practice states, “An essential element of the duty of disclosure is the obligation on the police or other investigating agency to pursue all reasonable lines of enquiry, including any line of enquiry that might point away from the accused as the perpetrator of the offence. What constitutes a reasonable line of enquiry will be dependent upon the circumstances of each individual investigation”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Northern Ireland, The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 Code of Practice for Northern Ireland (Revised) 2005 applies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Necessity and proportionality</h3>

<p>45. Regardless of the purpose for which the powers are being considered, there should be no presumption that information will be extracted from a device.</p>

<p>46. Key considerations when deciding if the use of the powers is necessary and proportionate are the impact on the right to privacy of the device user and collateral intrusion on the right to privacy of third parties whose information may also be extracted. Before using these powers, authorised persons must consider whether there are other less intrusive ways of obtaining the required information that would avoid intruding on the right to privacy of the device user or that of any third party whose information may be visible.</p>

<p>47.Sections 37(5)(c) and 41(4)(b) require that even when the authorised person reasonably believes that information stored on the device is relevant to a reasonable line of enquiry or purpose as above, they must also be satisfied that the use of the section 37 or section 41 power is necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose.</p>

<p>48.In order for the exercise of either power to be necessary and proportionate, the authorised person will have to be satisfied that the information sought is required to achieve the relevant purpose (e.g. preventing crime) and that the purpose cannot be achieved by other less intrusive means. The authorised person should consider the value of the information extracted for the relevant purpose and where possible ensure that the amount of the information extracted is minimised, balancing the need for the information against the interference with an individual’s (or individuals’) right to privacy. The authorised person should record their rationale as to why the information extraction is necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.</p>

<h3>Risk of obtaining other information</h3>

<p>49. Section 37(6) and (7) and section 41(5) and (6) require that an authorised person, exercising either power, must consider whether there is a risk of obtaining information other than that necessary for a purpose for which they may exercise the power. If this risk exists, then in order for the use of either power to be proportionate, an authorised person must be satisfied that there are no other means of obtaining the information that avoid that risk, or if there are such means, it is not reasonably practicable to use them.</p>

<p>50.To be satisfied that there are no other means of obtaining the information, authorised persons should consider the type of information required and whether there are other methods available to obtain it. For example, where a limited number of messages between a victim and a suspect are required to be produced, consider obtaining them by examining the suspect’s device. Where this is not possible, and the messages are not contested by the suspect, consider capturing images of the messages by taking screen shots.</p>

<p>51. The judgement in the Bater-James case specifically refers to the circumstances when it would be appropriate to use alternative methods to a ‘digital download’ and suggests that taking screen shots or making some other suitable record, may meet the needs of the case<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>. Where alternative means of obtaining the information are identified, if these reduce the risk of obtaining other information, these should be used unless it is not reasonably practical to do so. The test of what is reasonably practical is objective. The authorised person must assess whether it would be reasonably practicable to use the other means in the circumstances. Where alternative methods are used to obtain the information, the relevant evidential requirements of that jurisdiction will still need to be met. Delay alone would not provide sufficient justification not to pursue an alternative method unless there was a real and immediate risk of harm. In all cases, extracting information from a device (other than a suspect’s device) should be the last resort.</p>

<p>52. Other information might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>personal information on the device that is about the user but not necessary for the purpose, such as photos, content of messages or details of their contacts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information on the device that is about a third party and not necessary for the purpose – for example, photos sent to the device user taken by someone else, content of messages or contact information such as email addresses and phone numbers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>53. If, after considering necessity and proportionality (including the risk of obtaining other information), the authorised person is satisfied that use of one of these powers is justified, they can proceed, but should minimise the risk of obtaining other information as far as is practically possible. This should include use of appropriate technologies to support selective extraction and use of targeted key words, date ranges or other specifics to identify necessary information. Technological capabilities are improving at pace and authorised persons should be aware of, and keep up to date with, the technology options available in their organisations and ensure they use those that offer the most selective extraction of information.</p>

<h3>Section 43: Confidential information</h3>

<p>54. The following paragraphs give guidance on the exercise of the powers in section 37 and section 41 of the Act in relation to confidential information. This includes what confidential information is, how authorised persons should consider the risk of obtaining confidential information, and how they should proceed if they think there is a risk of obtaining confidential information.</p>

<p>55. Confidential information is defined in section 43 of the Act.</p>

<p>56. It comprises confidential journalistic material, as defined in the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, and ‘protected material’.</p>

<p>57. Broadly, confidential information refers to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Material created or acquired for the purposes of journalism which is held in confidence (or which, in the case of material in a communication, the sender holds in confidence or intends the recipient to hold in confidence).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain communications between a professional legal adviser and their client (or between such a person and others).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal records and other material acquired or created during the course of a trade, business, profession or occupation (or for the purposes of any office) which are held in confidence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>58. Authorised persons should avoid taking possession of confidential information. These powers must not be used where the intention is to extract confidential information. If the authorised person believes that there is confidential information on the device that is relevant to the investigation, a different power must be used to obtain it.</p>

<p>59. In no circumstances should an authorised person ask a device user to waive their right to confidentiality for the purposes of obtaining confidential information. If a device user expresses their wish to do so, the authorised person should advise that this decision is only taken after the device user has received legal advice.</p>

<p>60. Authorised persons should familiarise themselves with their organisation’s guidance and policies regarding confidential information, in addition to this Code of Practice.</p>

<h3>Protected material</h3>

<p>61. Protected material is defined in section 43(2) of the Act.</p>

<h3>Assessing whether there is a risk of obtaining confidential information</h3>

<p>62. In every case where an authorised person is considering using the section 37 or section 41 power, they must assess whether there is a risk of obtaining confidential information. Due to the vast amount of material held on some devices, such as smartphones, it is reasonable to assume that most people are likely to have some information that could be considered confidential. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be relevant to the case. For example, where a victim of a sexual assault has correspondence on their device with a solicitor relating to the sale of a property.</p>

<p>63. Authorised persons should use their professional judgement to assess whether there is a risk of obtaining confidential information, and whether it is appropriate to ask the device user. In some cases, the device user may not know whether they have confidential information on their device.</p>

<p>64. Where the device user is a lawyer or journalist and the device to be examined is used for their work, it may be reasonable to assume that their device will contain a high volume of the confidential material. In this scenario, it may be appropriate to ask them whether confidential material is stored on their device.</p>

<p>65. Authorised persons should use the facts of the case, and information from the device user to make an informed judgement about whether there is a risk of obtaining confidential information.</p>

<h3>How to proceed following the risk assessment</h3>

<p>66. If the authorised person does not think there is a risk of obtaining confidential information, they may proceed (subject to the other requirements of the Act and this Code being satisfied).</p>

<p>67. In the event the authorised person thinks there is a risk of obtaining confidential information, they must consider all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the amount of confidential information likely to be stored on the device</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the potential relevance of that information to the purpose(s) for which they may extract information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether there are other means of obtaining the information sought which do not risk obtaining confidential information and be satisfied that (i) there are not, or (ii) if there are, it is not reasonably practicable to use them</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>68. The exercise of the section 37 or section 41 power will only be proportionate if the authorised person has considered the matters at (a) and (b) above and satisfied themselves as per (c) above.</p>

<p>69. If the amount of confidential information is likely to be minimal, and the information is likely to be irrelevant to the case, the authorised person can proceed with the extraction. Where possible, selective extraction technology should be used to minimise the risk of obtaining confidential information.</p>

<p>70. If there is likely to be such a high volume of confidential information on the device that it will almost certainly be obtained during an extraction, the authorised person should consider using a different power.</p>

<p>71. If there is likely to be confidential information on the device and it is likely to be relevant to the case, then the authorised person must use another power to obtain it.</p>

<p>72. Where there is a risk of obtaining confidential material, the authorised person should record their risk assessment and their decision on how to proceed.</p>

<h3>What to do if confidential information is unintentionally obtained</h3>

<p>73. There may be occasions when confidential information is unintentionally obtained during an extraction. Depending on what the information is, the authorised person should proceed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if the confidential information accidentally obtained is irrelevant to the case, it should be deleted or redacted as soon as is practically possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the confidential material is relevant to the case, the authorised person should initially consult local guidance regarding what to do in this scenario. For example, it may be necessary to send all the extracted material to outside counsel.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sanctioning use of the powers</h3>

<p>74. All authorities who use these powers should have a procedure that clearly states who should sanction the use of the powers and the process they should follow.</p>

<p>75. This procedure should include information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the grade or rank of the individual who should sanction any use of the powers (‘the sanctioning officer’)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the documentation that the sanctioning officer should complete in order to allow extraction, including the record of how the request meets the requirements for use of the power set out in sections 37 and 41</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the procedure that the sanctioning officer should follow in the case of an urgent oral authorisation to use the powers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>76. The sanctioning officer should be at least one grade or rank higher than that of the individual requesting the extraction.</p>

<p>77. An urgent oral authorisation may be given by a person at least one grade or rank above the person seeking the authorisation where there is a real and immediate risk of serious harm to a person and the requirements for use of the power in section 37 are met. The person sanctioning the power should make a written record of their authority and the reason for it at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>78. The authorisation should be limited to the extraction of the specific information required for the purposes of which it is sought or to address the reasonable line of enquiry. Where, due to technical limitations, the information extracted is required to go beyond what is required, this must only take place with the device user’s agreement, where agreement is required for the use of the section 37 power.</p>

<h3>Recording the use of these powers</h3>

<p>79. Authorised persons should record in writing their rationale for their decisions to use these powers, to include the points noted above – the relevant information sought, why the use of these powers is necessary and proportionate, what alternative options for obtaining the information have been considered and, if any were identified, why it was not reasonably practicable to use them.</p>

<p>80. Part 4 of the Code provides more detail on the requirements for the recording of information.</p>

<h2>Part 4: Voluntary provision of device and agreement to extract information</h2>

<h3>Section 39: Requirements for voluntary provision and agreement</h3>

<p>81. Section 39 of the Act sets out the requirements which must be met in order for a person to be treated as having voluntarily provided a device and agreed to the extraction of information from it in (for the purposes of section 37 or 38.</p>

<p>82. This part of the Code includes guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the criteria that must be met for a person to be treated as having voluntarily provided an electronic device, and agreed to the extraction of information from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the difference between voluntarily providing the device and providing agreement to extract information from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what agreement means</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how to obtain agreement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how to ensure agreement is freely given without the application of undue pressure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the right of an individual to refuse to provide a device or agree to the extraction of information from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what to do in circumstances where the device user is not capable of voluntarily providing the device or agreeing to the extraction of information from it (if they are a child or an adult without capacity)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what to do when the device user is unable to provide confirmation of voluntary provision and agreement in writing because of a physical impairment or lack of literacy skills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recording the confirmation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Voluntary provision, agreement and undue pressure</h3>

<p>83. Where the use of the section 37 power requires a device user, or their representative (in the case of child or adult without capacity), to volunteer the device and agree to the information extraction, this must be provided in writing before the extraction is commenced. If agreement cannot be provided in writing because of the person’s physical impairment or lack of literacy skills, then agreement may be given orally, and the authorised person must record the agreement in writing.</p>

<p>84. The individual must not have been unduly pressured or coerced by anyone (including an authorised person) to provide the device or agree to the extraction of information from it. Nor must the device have been seized using any other lawful power.</p>

<p>85. The individual must have freely made an informed and conscious decision to volunteer the device and agreed to the extraction of information from it.</p>

<p>86. Undue pressure means making the person feel as though they do not have a choice about volunteering the device and agreeing to extraction. For example, if they are made to feel that an investigation will be discontinued, or other reasonable lines of enquiry not followed if they do not agree to extraction. There may be cases where the information on the device is the only remaining reasonable line of enquiry, but this (and what other action has been taken) should be explained clearly to the individual. It is recognised that in some circumstances the very act of making a request for a device and the extraction of information from it, may make the victim or witness feel a degree of pressure. The authorised person should be aware of this when explaining the reason for the request and how they have determined that it is necessary and proportionate.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Written notice</h3>

<p>87. The authorised person must provide the person with a written notice (in hard copy or electronic form), specifying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the information that is sought</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the reason why the information is sought (and, where relevant, how it supports a reasonable line of enquiry)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information will be dealt with once it has been extracted (including who will see it)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the person may refuse to provide the device or agree to the extraction of information from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the investigation or enquiry for the purposes of which the information is sought will not be brought to an end merely because of a refusal to provide the device or agree to the extraction of information from<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>88. The device user, or their representative should also be informed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>of how any collateral information obtained will be managed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>of when the device is likely to be returned</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that they can make a complaint to the controller<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup> if they feel the request for information is excessive, or that they have been coerced into providing the device and giving agreement.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>89. The information contained in the written notice should be carefully explained to the individual to ensure they have understood it, and care must be taken to ensure they do not feel coerced or under undue pressure to provide the device or give agreement.</p>

<p>90. The NPCC Data Processing Notice (DPN) is approved for use by police forces in England and Wales as the written notice. Authorised persons should consult relevant disclosure leads to obtain a copy of their own force/agency notice.</p>

<h3>Confirmation of voluntary provision and agreement</h3>

<p>91. Before extraction can take place, the authorised person must obtain confirmation in writing that the device has been volunteered and there is agreement that information can be extracted from it. The authorised person must then give the person a copy of the confirmation.</p>

<p>92. Where it is not possible to obtain written confirmation that the device has been volunteered and there is agreement that information can be extracted from it, because of physical impairment or a lack of literacy skills, oral confirmation must be given. The authorised person must then record the verbal confirmation and provide the person with a copy of that record.</p>

<p>93. A record of confirmation must be kept, even if confirmation was provided verbally,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup> as it may be requested at a later stage to show that the device was provided voluntarily, and agreement was given without coercion.</p>

<p>94. Further guidance about obtaining the views of those other than the person providing agreement, such as where the device user is a child or adult without capacity, are explained in Part 5 of this Code.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal of agreement</h3>

<p>95. The device user (or the person who has voluntarily provided the device and agreed to the extraction of information from it in accordance with section 38), has the right to withdraw their agreement for information to be extracted from the device. It is that individual’s decision to give the authorised person the device and to agree to the extraction of information from it, and they can change their mind. In the case of a device that is used by multiple users, only the person who voluntarily provided the device and agreed to the extraction of information from it can withdraw that agreement.</p>

<p>96. It should be made clear that withdrawal of agreement will mean that the device is returned, and the extraction of information will not take place, if extraction has not already taken place. However, if agreement is withdrawn after the extraction of information has taken place, it may not be possible to delete or return all information or return the device immediately. This is because of the duties on investigating agencies and prosecution services to disclose information to the defence. The investigating agency may also select to use a different legal power to retain and examine the device. In all cases, however, the extracted information and the device must only be retained as long as necessary in line with each authority’s data retention policies and other relevant guidance.</p>

<p>97. This is important to help the individual make an informed decision on what to do, especially as they may be allowing the authorised person to access a significant amount of personal information. Information about rights to withdraw agreement should be included in your organisation’s version of a Data Processing Notice (DPN) as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Section 38: Voluntary provisions and agreement where a device user is a child or adult without capacity</h3>

<p>98. A child<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> or adult without capacity is not able to voluntarily provide a device or agree to the extraction of information from it for the purposes of section 37 of the Act.</p>

<p>99. An alternative individual will be responsible for making these decisions on behalf of the child or adult without capacity, ensuring their best interests are considered in their decision.</p>

<p>100. Detailed guidance on use of these powers with children and adults without capacity is set out in Part 6 of this Code.</p>

<h3>Section 40: Extracting information under section 37 without voluntary provision or agreement: special cases</h3>

<p>101. The following guidance only applies in cases where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the device user has died, and they were a user of the device immediately before they died</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the device user is a child or an adult without capacity and the authorised person reasonably believes that their life is at risk, or there is risk of serious harm to them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the device user is missing, they were a user of the device immediately before they went missing and the authorised person reasonably believes that their life is at risk or there is a risk of serious harm to them</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>102. In these cases, the authorised person may extract information from the device even though it has not been voluntarily provided and agreement to extract information from it has not been given. However, the other provisions of section 37 still apply (e.g. the authorised person must still reasonably believe that information stored on the device is relevant to a purpose for which they may exercise the power).</p>

<p>103. For example, a police force may be attempting to locate a missing person who they believe to be at risk of serious harm. If while attempting to locate the person, the police find or are given the missing person’s device, they can exercise the section 37 power to extract information from the device, without seeking agreement from the device user or someone acting on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Section 41: Extracting information: investigations of death</h3>

<p>104. In the case of section 41 (extraction for the purposes of an investigation or inquest into a death), the authorised person may extract information from the device even though it has not been voluntarily provided and agreement to extract information from it has not been given. However, the other provisions of section 41 still apply (e.g. the authorised person must still reasonably believe that information stored on the device is relevant to the investigation or inquest).</p>

<h2>Part 5: Use of the section 37 power with vulnerable people</h2>

<h3>Vulnerable people / victims of crime</h3>

<p>105. The purpose of this part is to offer guidance on what authorised persons should think about when considering using the section 37 power in cases where the person is vulnerable.</p>

<p>106. In this part, we will focus on vulnerable victims of crime, who may have experienced trauma and who may need more support to make an informed decision as to whether to voluntarily provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it. However, in all cases where an authorised person is considering exercising the section 37 power, they should consider if a person is vulnerable and whether they may need more support to decide whether to voluntarily provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it.</p>

<p>107. By way of example, the Victims Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup> for England and Wales<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup> defines a victim as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person who has suffered harm, including physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss, which was directly caused by a criminal offence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a close relative (or a nominated family spokesperson) of a person whose death was directly caused by a criminal offence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>108. Children and adults without capacity, although vulnerable, cannot voluntarily provide their device or agree to the extraction of information from it for the purposes of section 37. Where the user is a child or adult without capacity, authorised persons should follow the guidance set out in Part 6: Section 38: Children and adults without capacity.</p>

<h3>What does ‘vulnerable’ mean?</h3>

<p>109. There is no single legal definition of ‘vulnerable’. For the purposes of the section 37 power, an individual can be considered vulnerable if they require some level of additional support to make an informed decision to provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it.</p>

<p>110. The College of Policing have said that “a person is vulnerable if as a result of their situation or circumstances, they are unable to take care of or protect themselves, or others, from harm or exploitation”.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup></p>

<p>111. Many victims and witnesses experience stress and fear during the investigation of a crime. Stress can affect the quantity and the quality of the communication with, and by, the individual concerned. The authorised person should be mindful of hidden vulnerabilities caused through disability, shock or trauma.</p>

<p>112. Where an individual is deemed vulnerable, authorised persons should make them aware that they can have additional support to help make an informed decision as to whether they will voluntarily provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it. The authorised person should take all reasonable steps to ensure that this support is accessible. The support may come from a range of persons or specialist support services – for example, from a family member, a friend or, in a case of a sexual offence, an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup> or other rape advocacy worker, where the service is available. In Scotland, victims and witnesses may also receive support from an Appropriate Adult<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup>, whose role is to facilitate communication for vulnerable adults during criminal investigations.</p>

<p>113. The following list may be used as guidance for determining if a person is vulnerable and whether they require additional, independent support to make a fully informed decision as to whether to voluntarily provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it. This is not an exhaustive list. The needs of the individual must be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account both the nature of the investigation and their involvement in it. If you are unsure whether a person is vulnerable, it may be appropriate to assume that a level of vulnerability exists, particularly for victims of sexual offences or in a case where someone has been physically or mentally harmed.</p>

<p>114. Examples of vulnerable people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has been the victim of a traumatic crime, such as rape or sexual assault or another type of violent crime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has been the victim of domestic abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has been the victim of stalking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has been the victim of people trafficking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who fears repercussions from working with an authorised person to further an investigation – for example, a whistle-blower</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who is suffering from fear or distress</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who is suffering from a mental disorder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has difficulty with social functioning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone with a physical disability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone on the autistic spectrum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone with learning difficulties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has difficulty in understanding what is being communicated to them (including language barriers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who has difficulty reading or writing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>115. Authorised Persons must follow any existing legislation and internal guidance regarding vulnerable people as appropriate to the specific case, in addition to this Code of Practice.</p>

<h3>Voluntary provision and agreement and vulnerable people</h3>

<p>116. Victims of crimes such as rape and other sexual offences may be particularly concerned about agreeing to share information. The possibility that they may be asked to hand over personal and sensitive information has been found to be a principal reason why victims of rape may withdraw from the criminal investigation process or may choose not to report the crime at all.</p>

<p>117. Detailed guidance on what information to give to individuals to ensure that they are able to voluntarily provide their device and provide free and unambiguous agreement to the extraction of information from it can be found in Part 4: Voluntary provision of device and agreement to extract.</p>

<p>118. An authorised person may need to go further to support and appropriately account for the needs of a vulnerable person/victim when exercising this power. For example, where an individual is in shock, such that they are unable to comprehend what is being asked of them in terms of providing their device and agreeing to the extraction of information from it, the authorised person may need to wait for the individual to regain their capacity before asking them to make decisions on these issues.</p>

<p>119. Agencies should refer to their own policies and guidance on how to recognise and support witnesses and victims who are suffering from trauma.</p>

<p>120. The authorised person should consider whether to include an independent advisor, social worker, friend, family member or other person who can provide comfort and support to the individual.</p>

<p>121. In Scotland, the authorised person should request Appropriate Adult support for victims and witnesses who are unable to understand proceedings or communicate effectively because of a mental disorder.</p>

<p>122. Although an individual may seek support on the decision to volunteer their device and agree to the extraction of information from it, the decision must be theirs. Only in cases where the device user is a child or an adult without capacity can (indeed, must) another person make those decisions.</p>

<p>123. Wherever it is possible to do so, the authorised person should ensure the individual has sufficient time to make these decisions.</p>

<p>124. If, as a result of their vulnerability, the individual cannot understand the DPN, the authorised person may need to explain the form in simple terms, via their support representative (a person referred to in bullet three above) if needed. The authorised person may have to read the DPN out loud to the individual if they are unable to read or comprehend the material on their own.</p>

<p>125. If language is an additional barrier to understanding what is being asked of the individual, an interpreter should be made available.</p>

<p>126. In all cases when dealing with a vulnerable victim, the utmost sensitivity and support should be exercised to ensure that the vulnerable victim understands what is being asked of them and to ensure that their trauma is not further exacerbated as a result of engaging in an investigative process.</p>

<p>127. If you are unsure about the level of support a person requires you should consult a supervisor or review appropriate guidance in your organisation.</p>

<h3>Privacy impact and vulnerable people/victims</h3>

<p>128. It is highly likely that a person’s electronic device will contain sensitive personal information about them or other persons, and authorised persons must consider the individual’s Article 8 right to respect for private life before any sensitive information is extracted (see Part 2 of this Code). Authorised persons should act in the knowledge that agreeing to the extraction of this kind of information will be an incredibly difficult experience, particularly where the person is vulnerable. Victims of rape and sexual offences, in particular, may be less willing to proceed with the criminal investigation process if they are concerned about having to share sensitive information.</p>

<p>129. In all cases, before exercising the section 37 power an authorised person must consider other methods for obtaining the required information that do not have the same level of intrusion. This is particularly important when there might be an acute privacy impact on a vulnerable victim.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding and vulnerable victims</h3>

<p>130. When exercising the power in section 37 in relation to a vulnerable victim, there are certain measures that should be taken to ensure they are adequately safeguarded. The following paragraphs give examples.</p>

<p>131. There may be cases when a vulnerable victim is involved in an activity where they are a victim, but do not see themselves as such – for example, if they have been sexually abused, but believe they are in a consenting relationship with their attacker. In cases such as these, the authorised person will need to work carefully with the vulnerable victim and any support representative (such as a social worker, family member, etc), to decide on the right course of action. In cases where the only option is to examine a device belonging to someone who does not believe they are a victim; it may be necessary to use a different power to obtain the device that does not rely on the individual’s agreement. Any use of an alternative power in these circumstances should be carefully considered.</p>

<p>132. Engaging in an investigation can be an especially traumatic experience for vulnerable victims. To account for this, authorised persons should make appropriate adjustments and consider the needs of the victim and where they will be most comfortable and able to make the best decisions for themselves. Being in a police station can be intimidating and some victims may feel better able to think clearly and consider their options if the discussion takes place at their home or in a neutral venue.</p>

<p>133. In all cases, authorised persons should aim to return a device as quickly as possible. In the case of a rape victim, ideally this should be within 24 hours of the device being taken. This 24-hour period starts only once the reasonable line of enquiry has been established and the authorised person has considered alternative means of following the line of enquiry or of obtaining the required information. Once these criteria have been met, the authorised person can seek agreement from the victim to extract the information from their device.</p>

<p>134. For vulnerable victims, it is especially important that their device receives priority examination so that it can be returned to them as soon as possible. If it is possible to prioritise the examination of a vulnerable victim’s device or allow the individual to make an appointment to have their device examined, thus ensuring they retain possession of it until it is ready to be processed, an authorised person should do so.</p>

<p>135. In the case where a rape victim’s electronic device is taken for examination and it is not possible to return it within 24 hours, they should be provided with a replacement device or support in obtaining one.</p>

<p>136. For vulnerable people who are not rape victims and where it may take longer than 24 hours to examine their device and return it to them, authorised persons should consult local safeguarding guidelines and provide a replacement device as appropriate according to their organisation’s best practice.</p>

<p>137. All individuals may be eligible for assistance from their mobile phone provider, per Ofcom’s vulnerable customer guidelines.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup></p>

<p>138. A vulnerable victim and, if appropriate, their support representative (independent advisor, family friend etc) should be referred to the relevant services (social services, counselling, etc) if ongoing professional support is necessary.</p>

<h2>Part 6: Section 38: Children and adults without capacity</h2>

<p>139. This part of the Code gives guidance on cases where a user of a device is a child or an adult without capacity. Children and adults without capacity are not able to make the decisions in section 37 for themselves. This part sets out who can make those decisions on their behalf (‘the alternative individual’) and what must be considered by the authorised person and by the alternative individual.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>140. For the purposes of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Act, a child is a person under the age of 18<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup>. Even if a child is deemed as having capacity, an alternative individual will still need to make decisions on whether to provide the device and agree to the extraction of information on behalf of the child.</p>

<h3>Who can, and cannot, make decisions for a child?</h3>

<p>141. The following people, acting in the best interests of the child, may act as an alternative individual where the device user is a child.</p>

<h4>A parent or guardian of the child</h4>

<p>142. “Parent” includes a biological parent, an adoptive parent, a step-parent who has been granted legal parental responsibility and a parent by virtue of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 (for example, a second female parent). ”Guardian” means another person who has been granted legal parental responsibility, a person who has been appointed as a guardian by court order or by a will (where the parents are deceased), or a person who, in practice, carries out the day-to-day care of a child, such as a local authority approved kinship or foster carer. Authorised persons should be clear about and record the status of the parent or guardian who is making the decisions. For further definitions of who can be considered as parent or guardian refer to the sections below.</p>

<p>143. In Northern Ireland, this may also include parent or guardian or other persons or bodies with parental responsibility for the child. The term ‘Guardian’ should be interpreted according to the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. Article 2 states that “guardian of a child” means a guardian (other than a guardian of the fortune or estate of a child) appointed in accordance with the provisions of Article 159 (Appointment by Court) or Article 160 (Appointment by parent or guardian).</p>

<p>144. In England, Wales, and Scotland the term ‘Guardian’ includes adults who have been appointed to the role of guardian by a court.</p>

<h4>A person representing a relevant authority or voluntary organisation</h4>

<p>145. If the child is in care and it is not appropriate for agreement to be sought from a parent or guardian, then a person representing the relevant authority or voluntary organisation providing care to that child can provide agreement instead.</p>

<p>146. This should, unless not possible in the circumstances, be a person known to the child.</p>

<h4>A responsible person</h4>

<p>147. Another responsible person, who must be 18 or over, must only be used as a last resort if a parent or guardian, or a person representing a relevant authority or voluntary organisation is unavailable to make the decisions on behalf of the child. Authorised persons must make sufficient effort to get in contact with a parent, guardian or person representing the relevant authority responsible for the child before turning to another responsible person. Best practice is to wait for such a person to be available to make the decisions.</p>

<p>148. If there is any doubt on the suitability of a responsible person, the authorised person should consider the necessity and proportionately of the use of these powers again and, if appropriate, delay until a parent, a guardian, a representative of the relevant authority or another, suitable responsible person can be found. Alternatively, the authorised person may seek alternative ways of obtaining the relevant information.</p>

<p>149. An authorised person who may exercise the section 37 power for the purpose for which information is being sought cannot act as a responsible person.</p>

<p>150. The responsible person should not be a suspect or person of interest in relation to the enquiry for which the power is being used and should ideally have an existing caregiving relationship with the child.</p>

<p>151. A person who is an authorised person, but who may not exercise the section 37 power for the purpose for which information is being sought, may act as a responsible other. So, for example, a member of the Serious Fraud Office would be able to act as a responsible person in a case where information is required to help locate a missing person. That is because members of the Serious Fraud Office cannot exercise the section 37 power for that purpose – they may only do so for the purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting crime.</p>

<p>152. Where the decisions have been made on behalf of the child by a responsible person, the authorised person must, unless they consider it is inappropriate to do so, notify a parent or guardian that the power has been used and for what purpose. This notification should be made as soon as possible. Where it is not appropriate to notify a parent or guardian because they are a suspect in the investigation, or where the authorised person believes that revealing that information has been extracted will put the child at risk, the authorised person should consider notifying another parent or guardian.</p>

<h3>Views of the child</h3>

<p>153. Before exercising the section 37 power, the authorised person must, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, ascertain the views of the child and have regard to any views so ascertained, taking account of the child’s age and maturity<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup>. They must have the child’s best interests in mind.</p>

<p>154. Only very young children may be incapable of expressing a view. Therefore, authorised persons must presume that a child is able to provide a view. This means where the child is reasonably locatable, their views must be sought. The age and maturity of the child should be taken into account in having regard to the views ascertained.</p>

<p>155. Authorised persons should ensure that an explanation has been provided to the child as to what will happen to their information and device and that, whilst their views will be taken into account, it is only an adult who can make decisions on their behalf. The authorised person should confirm that the person making the decisions on behalf of the child is aware of the child’s views. The adult may still decide to provide (or not to provide) the device and agree (or not agree) to the extraction of information from it having had regard to the child’s views.</p>

<p>156. Ultimately, the decisions on whether to provide the device and agree to extraction are for a parent, guardian, person representing the relevant authority or organisation in whose care the child is or responsible person.</p>

<p>157. In cases where the user is a child, authorised persons should record all relevant information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if the child was asked for their views, what those views were</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the child’s views differed from the views of the person providing the device and agreeing to the extraction of information from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the child was not asked their views, why not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the decision the authorised person came to on use of the power and why</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Adults without capacity</h3>

<p>158. In relation to England and Wales, a person is an adult without capacity if, within the meaning of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>, they lack capacity to voluntarily provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it. In this regard, authorised persons must have in mind the principles set out in section 1 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>

<p>159. In relation to Scotland, a person is an adult without capacity if they are incapable, within the meaning of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/4/contents" rel="external">Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000,</a> in relation to the voluntary provision of their device and agreement to the extraction of information from it. In this regard, authorised persons must have in mind the principles set out in section 1 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and the codes of practice issued further to it.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup></p>

<p>160. In relation to Northern Ireland, a person is an adult without capacity if, within the meaning of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/18/contents/enacted" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016</a>, they lack capacity to voluntarily provide their device and agree to the extraction of information from it. In this regard, authorised persons must have in mind the principles set out in section 1 of the Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016.</p>

<h3>Who can, and cannot, make decisions for an adult without capacity?</h3>

<p>161. The following people, acting in the best interests of the adult without capacity, may act as an alternative individual where the device user is an adult without capacity.</p>

<h4>A parent or guardian of the adult without capacity</h4>

<p>162. “Parent” includes a biological parent, an adoptive parent, a step-parent who has been granted legal parental responsibility and a parent by virtue of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup> (for example, a second female parent). ”Guardian” means another person who has been granted legal parental responsibility, a person who has been appointed as a guardian by court order or by a will (where the parents are deceased), or a person who, in practice, carries out the day-to-day care of the adult without capacity.  Authorised persons should be clear about and record the status of the parent or guardian who is making the decisions. For further definitions of who can be considered as parent or guardian refer to the sections below.</p>

<p>163. In relation to England and Wales, the term ‘Guardian’ includes adults who have been appointed to the role of guardian by a court.</p>

<p>164. In relation to Scotland, the term ‘Guardian’ should be interpreted according to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>section 64 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, which defines both welfare and financial guardians</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>section 58(1A) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which points to guardians with powers relating to the personal welfare of an adult</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>165. In relation to Northern Ireland, the term ‘Guardian’ should be interpreted according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1986/595" rel="external">the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986</a>.</p>

<h4>A person representing a relevant authority or voluntary organisation</h4>

<p>166. If the adult without capacity is in the care of a relevant authority or voluntary organisation and it is not appropriate for agreement to be sought from a parent or guardian, then a person representing the relevant authority or voluntary organisation providing that care can provide agreement instead.</p>

<p>167. This should, unless not possible in the circumstances, be a person known to the adult without capacity.</p>

<h4>A registered social worker</h4>

<p>168. In relation to England, “registered social worker” means a person registered as a social worker in a register maintained by Social Work England.</p>

<p>169. In relation to Wales, “registered social worker” means a person registered as a social worker in a register maintained by the Care Council for Wales.</p>

<p>170. In relation to Scotland, “registered social worker” means a person registered as a social worker in a register maintained by the Scottish Social Services Council. The term ‘social worker’ should be interpreted in accordance with section 77 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2001/8/contents/2001-07-19" rel="external">Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001</a>. Authorised persons should follow guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/role-registered-social-worker-statutory-interventions-guidance-local-authorities/pages/2/" rel="external">role of the registered social worker in statutory interventions</a>.</p>

<p>171. In relation to Northern Ireland, “registered social worker” means a person registered as a social worker in a register maintained by the Northern Ireland Social Care Council. The term ‘social worker’ should be interpreted in accordance with the Health and Personal Social Services Act (Northern Ireland) 2001.</p>

<h4>A person who under a power of attorney may make the relevant decisions</h4>

<p>172. In relation to England and Wales, this means a person with a lasting power of attorney which gives them the powers to make decisions on behalf of an individual who lacks capacity. Authorised persons should follow the relevant guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney">here</a>.</p>

<p>173. In relation to Scotland, this means welfare attorneys and continuing attorneys who have combined powers to make decisions regarding the welfare and financial matters of an individual who lacks capacity. Authorised persons should follow the Continuing and welfare attorneys: Code of Practice - gov.scot (www.gov.scot).</p>

<p>174. In relation to Northern Ireland, this means persons appointed under an enduring power of attorney, within the meaning of the Enduring Powers of Attorney (Northern Ireland) Order 1987; and following the commencement of Part 5 of the Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016, persons appointed under a lasting power of attorney, within the meaning of that Part.</p>

<h4>A deputy who may make the relevant decisions (not Scotland)</h4>

<p>175. In England and Wales, a deputy may be appointed under section 16 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Further guidance on the role of a deputy in England and Wales can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice">Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a>.</p>

<p>176. In Northern Ireland, a deputy may be appointed under section 113 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2016/18/part/6/crossheading/decisions-and-deputies/enacted" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>A person who under an intervention order may make the relevant decisions (Scotland only)</h4>

<p>177. Section 53 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 deals with intervention orders.</p>

<h4>A responsible person</h4>

<p>178. A responsible person, who must be 18 or over, must only be used as a last resort. Authorised persons must make sufficient effort to get in contact with a parent or guardian, or another suitable person, before turning to a responsible person. Best practice is to wait for such a person to be available to make the decisions.</p>

<p>179. If there is any doubt on the suitability of a responsible person, the authorised person should consider the necessity and proportionately of the use of these powers again and, if appropriate, delay until a suitable responsible person can be found. Alternatively, the authorised person may seek alternative ways of obtaining the relevant information.</p>

<p>180. An authorised person who may exercise the section 37 power for the purpose for which information is being sought may not act as a responsible person.</p>

<p>181. The responsible person should not be a suspect or person of interest in relation to the enquiry for which the power is being used and should ideally have an existing caregiving relationship with the adult without capacity.</p>

<p>182. A person who is an authorised person, but who may not exercise the section 37 power for the purpose for which information is being sought, may act as a responsible other.</p>

<p>183. Where the decision has been made on behalf of the adult without capacity by a responsible person, the authorised person must, unless they consider it inappropriate to do so, notify a parent or guardian that the power has been used and for what purpose. This notification should be made as soon as possible. Where it is not appropriate to notify a parent or guardian because they are a suspect in the investigation, or where the authorised person believes that revealing that information has been extracted will put the child at risk, the authorised person should consider notifying another parent of guardian.</p>

<h3>Views of the adult without capacity</h3>

<p>184. Where an authorised person assesses that a device user is an adult without capacity, the decisions as to whether to voluntarily provide the device and agree to the extraction of information from it must fall to another person (as specified above).</p>

<p>185. Before exercising the section 37 power, the authorised person should, so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so, ascertain the views of the adult without capacity and have regard to any views so ascertained, taking into account the conditions that affect their capacity. They must have the individual’s best interests in mind.</p>

<p>186. Authorised persons should ensure that an explanation has been provided to the adult without capacity as to what will happen to their information and device and that, whilst their views will be taken into account, it is only their parent, guardian or responsible other who can make decisions on their behalf. The authorised person should confirm that the person making the decisions on behalf of the individual is aware of their views. Ultimately, the person representing the individual may still decide to provide (or not to provide) the device and agree (or not agree) to the extraction of information from it having had regard to the individual’s views.</p>

<p>187. Some people’s ability to make decisions fluctuates because of a condition that they have. In such cases, if possible, the decisions as to whether to voluntarily provide the device and agree to the extraction of information from it should be made by the device user at a time when the person has the capacity to decide for themselves. It may also be helpful to discuss and record what the person would want if they lost capacity to make similar decisions in future, for example where it is anticipated that they will reach a stage due to a condition or illness that will prevent them from expressing an opinion should there be a need to extract additional information from their device in the future. This means that, if further decisions need to be taken in their best interests and for their benefit, the authorised person can take the person’s wishes into consideration.</p>

<p>188. In cases where the user is an adult without capacity, authorised persons should record all relevant information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the basis of the assessment that the adult is without capacity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the adult without capacity was asked for their views, what those views were</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the adult without capacity views differed from the views of the person providing the device and agreeing to the extraction of information from it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the adult without capacity was not asked their views, why not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the decision the authorised person came to on use of the power and why</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 7: Extracting information</h2>

<p>189. These powers allow an authorised person to extract information which is stored on an electronic device. As detailed in Part 3 of this Code (proportionality and the risk of obtaining other information), an authorised person must consider the risk of obtaining other information and should choose the extraction method that will allow for the most selective extraction possible, to allow the least amount of information needed to support the purpose to be extracted.</p>

<p>190. Information includes moving or still images and sounds<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup>, text messages or documents which are stored on the device, as well as systems data such as file directories and location information.</p>

<h3>Applicable devices</h3>

<p>191. ‘Electronic device’ means any device on which information is capable of being stored electronically and includes any component of such a device<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup>. This includes mobile phones, computers and USB sticks<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Type of extraction</h3>

<p>192. Technical capabilities vary between authorised persons. It is for the authorised person and forensic practitioner (if used) to determine the technical method of extraction to obtain the required information, and to limit the extraction of other information, bearing in mind the technical capabilities available. Some technology allows specific types of information to be targeted and extracted alone. However, other technology requires the extracting of all recoverable content on a device to enable a more specific review post-extraction, either manually or using search tools.</p>

<p>193. In many cases, the authorised person is likely to be the decision maker as to the purposes and the means of the processing of the data. In these circumstances, they will be acting as the ‘controller’, as defined in the DPA and the UK GDPR<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>194. In cases where the authorised person is not the decision maker as to the purposes and the means of the processing of the data, they may be acting as the ‘processor’, as defined in the DPA and the UK GDPR<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup>, even if they are making technical decisions about how to process the data.</p>

<p>195. Authorised persons must ensure information extraction is not excessive, minimising intrusion into the device user’s privacy and the privacy of others. Devices such as mobile phones can contain a lot of sensitive personal information which is often not relevant to the purpose for which extraction is required. Wherever it is possible to do so, bearing in mind the technology available to the authorised person, they should only extract the information which they require. For example, if an authorised person only needs to see photos taken on a certain date, they should aim to extract only those. This limits the impact on the device user’s and others’ privacy and means that there will be less information to analyse, therefore speeding up the enquiry or investigation.</p>

<p>196. In some cases, extracting a larger subset of information may be necessary to understand the specific information which the authorised person seeks to view. For example, viewing an entire conversation can put one message in context, and this may aid authorities to put together crucial evidence for their enquiry.</p>

<p>197. It is also important to note that some applications (such as some messaging applications) encrypt the information which is stored on the device. Each message will be stored in a database on the device along with all the other messages from the application. To view one individual message, it is likely that the authorised person would need to extract the full database and process the encrypted content in order to produce a readable version of the messages. This version can then be searched for a specific message. Any decisions on retention or deletion of the remaining information should be considered in line with relevant disclosure guidelines.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup></p>

<p>198. Authorised persons in England and Wales can find advice and information about examination of digital media device in CPS Guidance which has been endorsed by the court of appeal.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup> Authorised persons in Scotland can find guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.copfs.gov.uk/publications/prosecution-policy-and-guidance?showall=&amp;start=2" rel="external">Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Disclosure Manual</a>.

<h3>Annex B - Overview of the principles of Bater-James</h3>

<p>The principles in R V Bater-James and Mohammed [2020] EWCA Crim 970</p>

<p>For authorised persons in England and Wales, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/790.html" rel="external">Bater-James judgment</a> contains four principles in relation to the extraction and use of digital material, which are summarised below. While this was a criminal case that focused on the review of witnesses’ electronic communications, the principles are relevant in any case, enquiry or investigation where it is necessary and proportionate to examine a device.</p>

<p>The first issue of principle concerns identifying the circumstances when it becomes necessary for investigators to seek details of digital communications, and notes that it should not be assumed that it is necessary to inspect digital material in every case and should only be conducted as part of a reasonable line of enquiry.</p>

<p>The second issue of principle concerns guidelines around how an investigation of a device should be carried out proportionately and with regard to the privacy impact on the victim.</p>

<p>The third issue of principle concerns the information that should be provided to the person whose device is being examined, ensuring they are sufficiently informed as to the ambit of the review.</p>

<p>The fourth issue of principle concerns the consequences for the case if the person refuses access to a potentially relevant device.</p>

<h3>Annex C – DPA and GDPR</h3>

<p>There are specific functions and responsibilities under the DPA and UK GDPR for persons acting in their capacity as a ‘controller’ or a ‘processor’.</p>

<p>‘Controllers’ exercise overall control over the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. In other words, you are acting as a ‘controller’ if you decide what data to process and why<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A ‘processor’ acts on behalf of the ‘controller’ to process the data. You are likely to be acting as a ‘processor’ if you extract and review the data on direct instruction from the controller, if even if you make some technical decisions about how you process the data<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>‘Sensitive processing’ under DPA</h4>

<p>Section 35 of the DPA outlines the requirements when processing sensitive data. This is referred to as ‘sensitive processing’. This is only permitted in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when the data subject has given consent to the processing for the law enforcement purpose and at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose, that the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8, and at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup> in place.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The DPA defines ‘sensitive processing’ as:</p>

<p>a) the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership.</p>

<p>(b) the processing of genetic data, or of biometric data, for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual.</p>

<p>(c) the processing of data concerning health.</p>

<p>(d) the processing of data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual orientation</p>

<p>The conditions for ‘sensitive processing’ in Schedule 8 of the Act are:</p>

<p>1. necessary for judicial and statutory purposes – for reasons of substantial public interest;</p>

<p>2. necessary for the administration of justice;</p>

<p>3. necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another individual;</p>

<p>4. necessary for the safeguarding of children and of individuals at risk;</p>

<p>5. personal data already in the public domain (manifestly made public);</p>

<p>6. necessary for legal claims;</p>

<p>7. necessary for when a court acts in its judicial capacity;</p>

<p>8. necessary for the purpose of preventing fraud; and</p>

<p>9. necessary for archiving, research or statistical purposes.</p>

<p>You must be able to demonstrate that the processing is strictly necessary and satisfies one of the conditions in Schedule 8. Strictly necessary in this context means that the processing must relate to a pressing social need, and you cannot reasonably achieve it through less intrusive means.</p>

<p>Individuals providing agreement will have a reasonable expectation that any personal information is managed to a high standard where it may relate to protected characteristics or otherwise be special category data within the meaning of the DPA.</p>

<h4>General overview of the UK GDPR responsibilities</h4>

<p>Article 5 of the UK GDPR sets out seven key principles which must be complied with when processing personal data for non-law enforcement purposes, including when exercising these powers, summarised below.</p>

<p>Article 5(1) requires that personal data shall be:</p>

<p>(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);</p>

<p>(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);</p>

<p>(c) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);</p>

<p>(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);</p>

<p>(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals (‘storage limitation’);</p>

<p>(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).”</p>

<p>Article 5(2) adds that:</p>

<p>“The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).”</p>

<p>Article 6 of the UK GDPR defines the lawful basis on which you can process ‘special category data’ whilst Article 9 defines the conditions for processing<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Annex D - ‘special category data’ - conditions for processing under UK GDPR</h3>

<p>The UK GDPR defines ‘special category data’ as:</p>

<p>1) personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;</p>

<p>2) personal data revealing political opinions;</p>

<p>3) personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;</p>

<p>4) personal data revealing trade union membership;</p>

<p>5) genetic data;</p>

<p>6) biometric data (where used for identification purposes);</p>

<p>7) data concerning health;</p>

<p>8) data concerning a person’s sex life; and</p>

<p>9) data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Article 6 states that processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:</p>

<p>1. the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;</p>

<p>2. processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;</p>

<p>3. processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;</p>

<p>4. processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;</p>

<p>5. processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;</p>

<p>6. processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</p>

<p>Article 9 defines the conditions for processing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-89-gdpr/" rel="external">Article 89</a>(1) based on Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Information about a deceased person does not constitute personal data and therefore is not subject to the UK GDPR. However, processing data from a device obtained from a deceased person that contains data relating to other identifiable living persons, may constitute the processing of personal data under the UK GDPR regime.</p>
