<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>Under the Transport and Works Act 1992 (<abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr>) applications can be made for guided transport schemes in England and Wales. Presently the only ‘guided modes’ the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> relates to are physically guided transport schemes, such as those guided by cables or tracks. Changes in technology mean that transport systems can now also be guided by non-physical means.</p>

<p>This consultation sets out proposals to expand the application of the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> to provide a consenting route for transport schemes using non-physical guidance systems. The change being proposed is intended to support innovation and the deployment and use of new and more advance technologies.</p>

<p>This consultation is primarily aimed at all parties with an interest in the construction and operation of guided transport systems.</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Orders made under the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> can authorise guided transport systems in England and Wales. The <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> currently only allows for physically guided transport schemes to be authorised via this process.</p>

<p>Developments in technology mean that transport systems can now also be guided using non-physical means. Non-physical guidance could involve using simple sensor systems to detect paint or other road markings and direct a vehicle or more complex non-physical guidance using sensor systems to read the surrounding environment and direct a vehicle.</p>

<p>This consultation seeks your views on proposed changes to the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> legislation to allow applicants in England and Wales, a route for consent to be sought for guided transport schemes using non-physical guidance systems.</p>

<h2>Consultation proposals</h2>

<h3>Background to the Transport and Works Act 1992</h3>

<p>Section 1 of the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> allows for orders to be granted in relation to the construction or operation of a transport system such as (one of the following kind):</p>

<ul>
  <li>a railway</li>
  <li>a tramway</li>
  <li>a trolley vehicle system</li>
  <li>a system using a mode of guided transport prescribed by an order made under section 2 of the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> in England and Wales<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An order granted under the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> is a statutory instrument that will give the applicant the necessary powers to construct or operate the guided transport system. Any decision to make an order is made by the Secretary of State for Transport for schemes in England and the Welsh Government for schemes in Wales.</p>

<p>Section 2 of the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> allows the Secretary of State for Transport to make an order to prescribe other modes of guided transport systems that can be authorised by a <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> order. These guided transport modes are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/3231/contents/made" rel="external">Transport and Works (Guided Transport Modes) Order 1992</a> (the ‘Guided Modes Order’).</p>

<p>Article 2 of the Guided Modes Order sets out what these prescribed modes are with an interpretation of these modes set out in article 3. What is common to all the currently prescribed guided transport systems is that they are guided through physical means.</p>

<h3>The need for change</h3>

<p>An update proposed to the Guided Modes Order is intended to reflect recent developments in technology.</p>

<p>The proposed legislative change would provide a route for authorising (if the application is approved by the Secretary of State for Transport or the Welsh Government) guided transport schemes wanting to take advantage of new technology that uses non-physical means of guidance. This might cover simple sensor systems that detect paint or other road markings to direct a vehicle, or more complex sensor systems which read the surrounding environment to direct a vehicle.</p>

<p>We are aware of one transport authority looking to apply for a <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> order for a guided busway using this new technology, where there is still a driver, but the system is guided by sensor technology.</p>

<p>If this proposed amendment is made it would also allow for <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> applications to be approved for the construction and operation of a transport system that uses fully autonomous vehicles (driverless vehicles using non-physical forms of guidance). The use of such vehicles would, however, be subject to them complying with the requirements of any other relevant legislation relating to the use of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>This consultation is not about making changes to the way that <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> applications are progressed or decided but simply about what types of guided transport modes the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> should cover. Should the proposed change to the Guided Modes Order be approved, applicants wishing to seek a <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> order to authorise a scheme using non-physical guidance will be required to follow the same process to seek consent as all other schemes that fall to be considered within the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> regime.</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>All vehicles using this new technology would have to comply with the requirements of any relevant safety legislation, data and cyber security legislation or approvals as they do at present.</p>

<p>For any guided busways or any other road-based system of guided transport, the Health and Safety Executive is the enforcing authority in relation to the construction and operation of these systems.</p>

<p>Vehicles operating on the public road, even for part of the route, would have to comply with the requirements of relevant road traffic legislation.</p>

<h3>The proposed change</h3>

<p>It is proposed that articles 2 and 3 of the Guided Modes Order is amended to include the following text:</p>

<h4>Article 2</h4>

<p>Road based with sensor guidance</p>

<p>Track based with sensor guidance</p>

<h4>Article 3</h4>

<p>“Road based with sensor guidance” means a mode in which the vehicles are—</p>

<p>a) capable of operating on a road; and
b) guided wholly or mainly by means of sensors on the vehicles which, by reference to the vehicles’ external environment or to the receipt of electromagnetic information, provide data which is used to guide the vehicle.</p>

<p>“Track-based with sensor guidance” means a mode in which the vehicles are—</p>

<p>a) supported by means of a track or other structure not being a road; and
b) guided wholly or mainly by means of sensors on the vehicle which, by reference to the vehicles’ external environment or to the receipt of electromagnetic information, provide data which is used to guide the vehicle</p>

<p>“electromagnetic” includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.</p>

<h3>Impact assessment</h3>

<p>The Guided Modes Order is an enabling regulation only and the proposed change will allow for future applications under the <abbr title="Transport and Works Act 1992">TWA</abbr> to include transport systems guided by non-physical means.</p>

<p>The proposed change will not impose any direct obligations or costs on industry, business or any other body and therefore an impact assessment is not required.</p>

<p>The consultation questions relating to the proposed legislative change and its impact are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-consultation-questions">Annex A</a>.</p>

<h2>What will happen next</h2>

<p>All responses will be analysed and considered, A summary of responses, including the next steps, will be published within 3 months of the consultation closing, on GOV.UK. Paper copies will be available on request.</p>
