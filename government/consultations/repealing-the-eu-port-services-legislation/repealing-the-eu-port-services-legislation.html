<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0352" rel="external">EU Port Services Regulation (<abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr>)</a> came into effect in March 2019.</p>

<p>It is EU law that was directly applicable to the UK as a member state and was supplemented in domestic legislation by practical and procedural provisions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/575/made" rel="external">The Port Services Regulations 2019</a>.</p>

<p>It has continued to apply in the UK after the end of the transition period (from December 2020), but as amended by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/671/made" rel="external">Pilotage and Port Services (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a> to ensure operability. This EU regulation is known as retained EU law. The regulation provides a framework for the provision of port services, common rules on financial transparency and on port infrastructure charges.</p>

<p>The UK has a highly competitive (and largely private) ports sector. The <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr> was designed and implemented with EU public sector ports in mind. Having left the EU, the UK now has an opportunity to review this regulation and its appropriateness for our ports sector.</p>

<p>The government has signalled its intention to revoke the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr>. On 16 September 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/lord-frost-statement-to-the-house-of-lords-16-september-2021">Lord Frost told the House of Lords</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We also intend to repeal the EU’s Port Services Regulation – which is a very good example of a regulation that was geared heavily towards EU interests and never worked properly for the UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This consultation seeks views on the intention to repeal the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr> and its 2 associated statutory instruments (<abbr title="statutory instruments">SIs</abbr>) as part of the legislation process, and on the transitional arrangements for doing so.</p>

<p>It also invites evidence about the costs and other effects that should be covered in an impact assessment, which is required as part of the legislative process.</p>

<h2>Proposals</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R0352" rel="external">Regulation (EU) 217/352</a>, the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr>, includes provisions in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>market access for port service providers</li>
  <li>transfer of undertakings</li>
  <li>financial transparency</li>
  <li>charges</li>
  <li>training and consultation</li>
  <li>complaints and appeals</li>
</ul>

<p>The government’s view is that all these areas are sufficiently covered in the UK by commercial practice within the framework of domestic law.</p>

<p>In some of these areas, there were also preexisting provisions in UK and/or devolved legislation. For example, the Harbours Act 1964 contains (s.30) requirements for the publication of charge tariffs and (s.31) provisions for objecting to ship, passenger and goods dues, while the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations continue, as retained EU law, to provide safeguards in this area.</p>

<p>Through new primary legislation, when Parliamentary time allows, we intend to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>repeal the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr> as EU retained law</li>
  <li>revoke <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/575/made" rel="external">The Port Services Regulations 2019</a>, which implements discretionary and mandatory elements of the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>amend the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/671/made" rel="external">Pilotage and Port Services (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a>, to revoke those parts of the regulations that relate to the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr> and were made to ensure that the EU <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr> remained operable after the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2019 Regulations provide for complaints to be made in accordance with the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr>. They provide that a complaint must be made within 45 days of the act or omission in question.</p>

<p>After that, the enforcement authority has 14 days to serve notice on the respondent port, and at the same time, a 60-day preliminary consideration period begins.</p>

<p>The subsequent decision and appeals processes are set out in the regulations.</p>

<p>In over two and a half years since the legislation has been in effect, no complaint has yet been made in the UK.</p>

<p>Should any complaint be open or made on the date of the coming into force of the proposals, this consultation proposes that transitional arrangements will apply.</p>

<p>Under the transitional arrangements, we are proposing that Part 3 of the 2019 Regulations (complaints and appeals) would continue to have effect to define the process for completing any outstanding complaint or appeal.  We would, however, welcome any alternative views on transitional arrangements for complaints and/or appeals.</p>

<p>While ministers have already announced the intention to repeal when Parliamentary time allows, we invite your views on this.</p>

<p>Subject to the outcome of this consultation, and to legislative priorities, the <abbr title="EU Port Services Regulation">PSR</abbr> could be repealed and the <abbr title="statutory instruments">SIs</abbr> revoked and amended during the present Parliament.</p>
