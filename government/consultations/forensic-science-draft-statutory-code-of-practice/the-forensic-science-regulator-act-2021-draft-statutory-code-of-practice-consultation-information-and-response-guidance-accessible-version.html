<h2>About this consultation</h2>

<p>This consultation seeks views on a draft code of practice (‘the code’) to be issued under the Forensic Science Regulator Act 2021. The draft code sets quality standard requirements for forensic science activities undertaken for matters related to the investigation of crime and the criminal justice system in England and Wales.</p>

<p>Representations are welcome from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forensic units from the 43 territorial police forces</li>
  <li>commercial forensic science units</li>
  <li>professional bodies</li>
  <li>government departments</li>
  <li>interested groups</li>
  <li>the wider public</li>
</ul>

<p>The draft code applies to England and Wales, but the Regulator welcomes views from stakeholders from across the UK. The Regulator also welcomes views from forensic science units outside of England and Wales but to whom the code will apply in so far as they carry on activities within England and Wales.</p>

<p>Following the consultation period, responses will be analysed, and the draft code will be revised as necessary. The code will then be sent to the Secretary of State for the Home Department for approval. Following this, the code will then be laid before Parliament for approval. A response to this consultation exercise will be published on Gov.uk.</p>

<h3>Duration</h3>

<p>The consultation will be open for 12 weeks from 8 August 2022 to 11.45pm on 31 October 2022.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Forensic science is a critical and important part of criminal investigations and the administration of justice, not only to identify offenders and provide expert evidence to the courts, but it is one of the strongest safeguards against false allegation and wrongful conviction. Forensic science examinations carry significant risks, and the consequences of a quality failure can be profound, particularly where there is a system rather than an individual failure. The former could lead to the review of hundreds or even thousands of results generated by a flawed technique or method. The purpose of forensic science regulation is to ensure that accurate and reliable scientific evidence is used in criminal investigations, in criminal trials, and to minimise the risk of a quality failure.</p>

<p>The model for regulation of forensic science in England and Wales is based on each forensic unit implementing and operating an effective quality management system that meets the requirements of the code. This will provide the necessary control of processes and minimise the risk of quality failure.</p>

<p>The Forensic Science Regulator Act 2021 (‘the Act’) received Royal Assent in April 2021. The Act makes the role of the Forensic Science Regulator (‘the Regulator’) a statutory one and requires the Regulator to prepare and publish a code of practice. The Act also introduces new statutory powers for the Regulator to investigate and issues compliance notices where they have concerns about how a forensic science activity is being conducted. The Regulator will be able to issue compliance notices, which will require forensic practitioners who pose unacceptable risk to the criminal justice system to take remedial action or be prohibited from carrying out a forensic science activity.</p>

<p>There is broad support for the introduction of statutory powers, with many reviews and reports over the past decade recommending that the Regulator have statutory powers to enforce compliance with quality standards.</p>

<h2>What is the code of practice?</h2>

<p>The draft code of Practice (‘the code’) is required under Section 2 of the Act. The code sets out requirements that apply to forensic science activities subject to the code, which provides a framework for forensic units to provide assurance that the forensic science they provide is of an appropriate quality standard.</p>

<p>This code is based on the regulatory model that existed for forensic science in England and Wales prior to the introduction of the Act, which requires each forensic unit to operate an effective quality management system and, where required by this code, achieve and maintain accreditation to a suitable international standard and this code.</p>

<p>The draft code therefore is largely based on issue 7 of the Code of Practice and Conduct, but also contains additions to cover the provisions set out in the Act including Regulator’s investigations, issuing of compliance notices, issuing completion certificates, appeals and other functions of the Regulator.</p>

<p>The code applies to all those undertaking forensic science activities subject to the code, whether individual practitioners, academics, public or private sector or forensic science units. These can be small teams in larger organisations, sole practitioners, or large providers, and can be commissioned by the prosecution or the defence.</p>

<p>The code applies to forensic science activities undertaken for matters related to the criminal justice system in England and Wales.</p>

<h2>Why are we consulting?</h2>

<p>Section 3 of the Act requires that the Regulator consult such persons as the Regulator considers appropriate before publishing a code of practice. The Act specifies that the persons consulted must include persons appearing to the Regulator to be representative of persons who are, or are likely to be, carrying on activities to which the proposed code will apply.</p>

<p>This consultation is to fulfil the requirements of the Act for a statutory consultation.</p>

<p>Following consultation, the Regulator will consider representations made about the draft code. The code will be given to the Secretary of State for the Home Department for approval, and then laid before Parliament for approval before it will come into effect.</p>

<h2>Supporting information</h2>

<p>In preparing the draft code, the Regulator has engaged with stakeholders and technical experts, including from forensic science providers, the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS), and the Forensic Science Advisory Council. The Regulator also made two drafts of the code available for informal comment in January 2022 (‘Version 1.0’) and April 2022 (‘Version 2.0’). Version 1 was a draft of the core code, and Version 2 was an updated core code and the first drafts of the FSA definitions.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Regulator’s engagement was to be transparent in the progress to develop the draft, and to utilise the expertise of the community to refine the draft. The draft statutory code is largely based on the previous non-statutory code of practice and conduct, and the underlying regulatory model of requiring organisations to have an effective quality management system is the same. The Regulator has provided comment on the common themes of the informal feedback comments in the Forensic Science Regulator Newsletter: Number 1.</p>

<p>Information about changes made between issue 7 of the code of practice and conduct and version 1.0 of the draft code made available during informal engagement (eg the introduction of the concept of the senior accountable individual can be found in the ‘note of changes’ in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forensic-science-regulator-draft-core-statutory-code-for-comment">Forensic Science Regulator: draft core statutory code for comment</a> page.</p>
