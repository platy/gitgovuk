<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>1.1.1 Forensic science is a critical and important part of criminal investigations and the administration of justice, not only to identify offenders and provide expert evidence to the courts, but it is one of the strongest safeguards against false allegation and wrongful conviction. Forensic science examinations carry significant risks, and the consequences of a quality failure can be profound, particularly where there is a system rather than an individual failure. The former could lead to the review of hundreds or even thousands of results generated by a flawed technique or method. The aim of forensic science regulation is to ensure that accurate and reliable scientific evidence is used in criminal investigations, in criminal trials, and to minimise the risk of a quality failure.</p>

<p>1.1.2 The model for regulation of forensic science in England and Wales is based on each forensic unit implementing and operating an effective quality management system that meets the requirements of this Code. This will provide the necessary control of processes and minimise the risk of quality failure.</p>

<p>1.1.3 An effective quality management system allows forensic units to understand and manage the risk of quality failure and recover from quality failure. The key elements of a quality management system are:</p>

<p>a. Validation of methods;</p>

<p>b. Defining, demonstrating and testing the initial and ongoing competence of practitioners;</p>

<p>c. Having documented and controlled procedures, and an internal audit process to ensure they are effective and being followed;</p>

<p>d. Commitment from senior leadership, including making available sufficient resources (see section 16.2); and</p>

<p>e. Enabling continuous improvement.</p>

<p>1.1.4 The establishment of an effective quality management system provides the basis for forensic units to produce reliable results and understand and manage the risk of a quality failure. Quality management systems in forensic units in the UK are, where accreditation is required, assessed by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service ® (UKAS ®) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> against international standards<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and guidance, primarily BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a>, BS EN ISO/IEC 17020:2012 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a>, and ILAC G19:06/2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a>. Similar provisions will apply with other accreditation bodies.</p>

<p>1.1.5 The role of the non-statutory Forensic Science Regulator was established in 2007 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> under the Royal Prerogative to set standards for forensic science and ensure compliance with those standards. This was achieved through the establishment of the Codes of Practice and Conduct <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">4</a>, appendices covering different sectors of forensic science, and general guidance documents. In 2011 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">5</a> the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee called for the Forensic Science Regulator to be given statutory powers, it reinforced this in two further reports <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">6</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">7</a> and the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee also called for statutory powers <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">8</a>. A Private Members Bill <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">9</a> to establish statutory powers for the Forensic Science Regulator was introduced in Parliament in 2020 and, following modification, the Forensic Science Regulator Act 2021 (the ‘2021 Act’) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> received Royal Assent on 29 April 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">11</a>. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.1.6 The role of the Forensic Science Regulator (the ‘Regulator’) under the 2021 Act was introduced on 25 July 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">12</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> The Forensic Science Regulator Act 2021</h3>

<p>1.2.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> requires the Regulator to prepare and publish a code of practice about the carrying on of forensic science activities (FSAs) in England and Wales. This document is the Code of Practice (the ‘Code’) required by Section 2 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>. This Code builds on the non-statutory Codes of Practice and Conduct <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">4</a> incorporating much of their content.</p>

<p>1.2.2 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> introduced powers for the Regulator to intervene where they have reason to believe or believe that a person <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> may be undertaking a forensic science activity to which this Code applies in a way that creates a substantial risk (that being a risk which is more than theoretical) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> of:</p>

<p>a. Adversely affecting any investigation; or</p>

<p>b. Impeding or prejudicing the course of justice in any proceedings. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.2.3 The powers introduced include one to investigate [see s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>] and one to require compliance [see s6 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>].</p>

<p>1.2.4 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> makes further provision for the Regulator to require persons to provide copies of documents and other information in the person’s possession or control as part of a Regulator’s investigation.</p>

<p>1.2.5 Every effort should be made by all those who work in forensic science to avoid the situation arising where there is an unacceptable risk to an investigation or the administration of justice. The Senior Accountable Individual (see section 16) shall be accountable for compliance with the Code and the monitoring and mitigation of the risk of quality failures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> The Code</h3>

<p>1.3.1 This Code is based on the regulatory model historically (i.e. prior to the introduction of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>) in use for forensic science in England and Wales in that it requires each forensic unit to operate an effective quality management system and, where required by this Code, achieve and maintain accreditation to a suitable international standard and include compliance with this Code in the schedule of accreditation. Also included in this Code are additions to cover the provisions set out in the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> including Regulator’s investigations, issuing of compliance notices, issuing completion certificates, appeals and other functions of the Regulator. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.3.2 This Code applies to all those undertaking FSAs subject to this Code, whether individual practitioners, academics, public or private sector or forensic science units. These can be small teams in larger organisations, sole practitioners or large providers and can be commissioned by the prosecution or the defence.</p>

<p>1.3.3 This Code applies to FSAs undertaken for matters related to the Criminal Justice System (CJS) in England and Wales. Future versions of the Code can be applied to other jurisdictions and/or purposes by order of the Secretary of State [see s11(2)(c) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<p>1.3.4 This Code is not intended to be a substitute for the complete version of the international standards referred to. Section 110 of this Code cross references to the key clauses that appear in the normative references (see section 11.2); this is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of the provisions. Forensic units applying for, or holding, accreditation to one, or more, of the international standards (issued by the International Organization for Standardization) remain responsible for ensuring they are aware of all relevant requirements within, or related to, those standards.</p>

<h2>Part A - Legal Position</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The Forensic Science Regulator</h2>

<p>3.1.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> placed the Regulator on a statutory basis (as a new legal entity) and provided the Regulator with legal powers. Those include, but are not limited to, the power to:</p>

<p>a. Issue a code of practice;</p>

<p>b. Issue guidance and/or advice;</p>

<p>c. Investigate concerns; and</p>

<p>d. Protect the CJS from poor practice in forensic science.</p>

<p>3.1.2 While the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> makes no reference to ‘quality’ or ‘standards’ the Written Ministerial Statement, in 2007 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">13</a>, made clear that the role of the Regulator related to quality standards in forensic science. The explanatory memorandum <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">14</a> which accompanied the bill (which became the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>) and the Parliamentary debates <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> on the bill were clear that the main aim of the bill was to transfer the then existing role to a statutory basis and provide additional powers.</p>

<p>3.1.3 The role of the Regulator therefore focusses on quality standards in forensic science as opposed to any other aspect of the provision of forensic science.</p>

<p>3.1.4 The Regulator establishes the quality standards which must be implemented and maintained by those undertaking FSA in England and Wales. These standards are often developed in partnership with a specialist group including, but not limited to, technical experts, representatives of those that commission the work, United Kingdom Accreditation Service, professional/regulatory bodies, and key stakeholders in the CJS. These standards are set out in the code of practice issued under s2 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<p>3.1.5 The Regulator may also provide guidance in relation to undertaking FSAs (whether covered by this Code or not) in England and Wales. While such guidance is often produced in a similar manner to standards it is not published in the code of practice. The guidance may advise forensic units on how to achieve and maintain the requirements set out in the code. Non-compliance with guidance does not, by itself, establish non-compliance with the code but any forensic unit which does not comply with guidance (e.g. chooses another approach to achieving requirements) shall be capable of showing how the requirements of the code have been met.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Basis of Appointment of the Forensic Science Regulator and Legal Powers</h2>

<p>4.1.1 Those sections of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> which did not become effective on Royal Assent [see s13 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>] were brought into effect by Regulations issued by the Secretary of State [see s13(4) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>]. Those Regulations are as follows.</p>

<p>a. The Forensic Science Regulator Act 2021 (Commencement No. 1 and Transitional Provision) Regulations 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">12</a>brought sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12 into effect on 25 July 2022.</p>

<p>b. ### brought sections ### into effect on ###.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Forensic Science Activities</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Legal Basis</h3>

<p>5.1.1 The approach taken in the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> [see s11] was to establish the concept of ‘forensic science activity’ (FSA). The definition adopted was, deliberately, one which could cover anything which might conceivably be considered forensic science. The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> [see s2] requires that the Regulator defines the FSAs which are subject to the code. This places responsibility on the Regulator for defining, with sufficient clarity, what activities are FSAs subject to the code.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Definition</h3>

<p>5.2.1 Section 11 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> defines FSA as follows.</p>

<p>(1) In this Act “forensic science activity” means an activity relating to the application of scientific methods for a purpose mentioned in subsection (2).</p>

<p>(2) Those purposes are—</p>

<p>(a) purposes relating to the detection or investigation of crime in England and Wales;</p>

<p>(b) purposes relating to the preparation, analysis or presentation of evidence in criminal proceedings in England and Wales;</p>

<p>(c) such other purposes as the Secretary of State may specify in regulations made by statutory instrument.</p>

<p>5.2.2 At the time of publication of the first issue of this Code no regulations have been issued under the provisions of s11(2)(c).</p>

<p>5.2.3 The s11 definition is clearly a wide one which could cover a significant range of activities.</p>

<p>5.3.1 The definition of FSA in 5.2.1 makes clear that FSA must be undertaken for one of the purposes set out in s11(2) 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<p>5.3.2 The definition refers to ‘crime’ rather than a specific crime so that the work does not have to be related to a specific offence or suspected offence.</p>

<p>5.3.3 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> uses the text ‘relating to’ which indicates the work does not have to be directly for the purposes stated.</p>

<h4>Territorial Extent</h4>

<p>5.3.4 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> imposes territorial restrictions. These are discussed in section 7 of this Code.</p>

<h4>Approach</h4>

<p>5.3.5 The general requirements for FSAs (see section 42) are intended to give effect to the limitations set out above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Levels</h3>

<p>5.4.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> provides, see s2, that the Regulator shall issue a Code of Practice and, in that code, shall define which FSAs are subject to the Code. The Regulator’s powers to investigate [see s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>] and issue compliance notices [see s6 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>] apply only to FSAs which are subject to the code.</p>

<p>5.4.2 In contrast, the Regulator’s powers to provide guidance [see s9(1) 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>] and provide advice [see s9(2) 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>] are available in relation to all FSA undertaken in England and Wales.</p>

<p>5.4.3 This means that the Regulator can define activities which might be considered forensic science (or some related field or undertaking) into levels as follows.</p>

<p>a. Activities which are not FSA.</p>

<p>b. Activities which are FSA, but which are not subject to the code.</p>

<p>c. Activities which are FSA and are subject to the code.</p>

<p>5.4.4 The Regulator can set different requirements for different FSA [see s2(2)(c) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>].</p>

<p>5.4.5 The Regulator has no direct role in respect of those activities which are defined not to be FSA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Approach to FSA Definition</h3>

<p>5.5.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>, see s2(2)(a), requires that the code sets out which FSAs are subject to the provisions of the code. The primary purpose of the definition of FSAs in this Code is to satisfy that requirement. It follows that, in relation to any issue of the code:</p>

<p>a. A declaration that an activity is an FSA subject to the code is conclusive; and</p>

<p>b. A declaration that an FSA is not subject to the code is conclusive.</p>

<p>5.5.2 The FSAs covered, and not covered, by the code may be different in future issues of the code.</p>

<p>5.5.3 Where an activity is not defined as an FSA in the code this is not conclusive as to the issue. Only a clear statement by the Regulator, in the code, or by regulatory notice, will achieve this.</p>

<p>5.5.4 To ensure it is clear what is covered, and which standards apply for each FSA, the definitions may include exclusions. In some cases, these exclusions will make clear that activities which are not considered FSA are excluded from a particular definition. There are several aspects of the definition of FSAs which will be common across all, or most, definitions.</p>

<p>5.5.5 Section 42 and Section 44 of this Code sets out these general provisions and requirements which apply to all FSA definitions unless clear language to the contrary is included in a specific FSA definition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Scope of FSA</h3>

<p>5.6.1 A forensic unit which undertakes any part of an FSA is undertaking that FSA.</p>

<p>5.6.2 In general, a forensic unit which is carrying on an FSA is not required to deliver every aspect of the description of the FSA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Restrictions</h3>

<p>5.7.1 The definition of FSA in the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> is, deliberately, wide enough to cover most areas where scientific methods <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> are used in the CJS. In defining the FSAs which are subject to this Code the Regulator has focussed on those FSAs which have historically been considered forensic science.</p>

<p>5.7.2 In future editions of this Code the scope of activities which are covered by the code may expand.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> Significance</h3>

<p>5.8.1 The purpose of defining activities as FSAs is to delineate the remit of the Regulator. It is not intended, by itself, to make any comment on the nature or value of any activity (whether defined as an FSA or not).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> The Code</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>6.1.1 Section 2 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> requires the Regulator to “prepare and publish a code of practice about the carrying on of forensic science activities in England and Wales”.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Limits on the Code</h3>

<p>6.2.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> imposes territorial restrictions. These are discussed in section 7.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Changes to the Code</h3>

<p>6.3.1 This Code has, or in time will, replace the Codes of Practice and Conduct <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">4</a> issued by the non-statutory Forensic Science Regulator. This Code will change over time. The process by which this will occur is discussed in section 12.</p>

<p>6.3.2 It is inevitable that there will be circumstances where the work on an individual case will occur over a timescale in which more than one issue of the code is in force.</p>

<p>6.3.3 All work should be performed in accordance with the Code which is in effect at the time the work was undertaken. There is no requirement to revisit work which has already been completed if this Code changes except where a quality issue has been reported. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Territorial Extent</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>7.1.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> imposes restrictions on the territorial application of its provisions in three ways. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>a. There are restrictions on the nature of FSAs [see s11 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>].</p>

<p>b. There are restrictions on the application of the Code [see s2 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a></p>

<p>c. There are restrictions on the application of the Act [see s13 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>].</p>

<p>7.1.2 It is important to be clear that these are separate restrictions as they apply in different ways to different provisions of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>. To understand the operation of the Code it is necessary to appreciate all of these provisions and the manner in which they interact.</p>

<p>7.1.3 The restrictions on the FSA and Code are discussed below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Forensic Science Activities</h3>

<p>7.2.1 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> creates a territorial limit to the scope of FSA by reference to ‘England and Wales’.</p>

<p>7.2.2 The terms ‘England’ and ‘Wales’ are defined in The Interpretation Act 1978 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">15</a>.</p>

<p>7.2.3 In relation to s11(2)(a) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> the limit is taken to mean that the work must relate to crime in England and Wales. s11(2)(a) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> imposes no restriction on where the FSA may be undertaken (however, see 7.3.1).</p>

<p>7.2.4 In relation to s11(2)(b) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> the limit is taken to mean the criminal proceedings must occur in England and Wales. It imposes no restriction on:</p>

<p>a. Where the crime, or suspected crime, occurred; or</p>

<p>b. Where the FSA is undertaken.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> The Code</h3>

<p>7.3.1 The provisions of s2 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> mean that this Code only applies to FSAs which are undertaken in England and Wales.</p>

<p>7.3.2 An FSA will, subject to the point in section 7.3.3, be undertaken within England and Wales if the activity occurs within the areas covered in those definitions.</p>

<p>7.3.3 The following activities shall always be considered to occur in England and Wales regardless of the location of the forensic unit:</p>

<p>a. The reporting of the outcome of any activities; and/or</p>

<p>b. The provision of evidence (whether written or oral).</p>

<p>7.3.4 Any person reporting on the outcome of forensic science activities, or providing evidence, in England and Wales is subject to guidance issued by the Regulator in relation to the carrying on of forensic science activities regardless of the location of the forensic unit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> International Obligations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Forensic Service Providers Regulations</h3>

<p>8.1.1 The Accreditation of Forensic Service Providers Regulations 2018 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a> create requirements related to the use of providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> in certain areas of forensic science. Whilst this Code and the Regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a> establish a requirement, in certain circumstances, for accreditation the Regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a> are separate from the work of the Regulator.</p>

<p>8.1.2 This Code is not related to the operation of the Regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a> and nothing in this Code should be taken to be of any significance in relation to the operation of the Regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a>.</p>

<p>8.1.3 The Regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a> are of no significance to the operation of this Code. Nothing in the Regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a> affect the operation of this Code. In particular, the provisions in regulation 4(2A) do not apply where a requirement for accreditation is created by this Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>8.1.4 In all cases where this Code requires accreditation, the accreditation must be through the normal route employed by the accreditation body involved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Future Obligations</h3>

<p>8.2.1 Where HM Government has determined that the United Kingdom (or any part thereof) should comply with international agreements, or treaties, which relate to the quality of forensic science these may be reflected in future issues of the code.</p>

<p>11.3.4 The word ‘should’ is used in this Code to indicate the clause is a recommendation based on generally accepted practice in the forensic science profession.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> Application of Standards</h3>

<h4>The Code</h4>

<p>11.4.1 This Code sets out the standards, and other requirements, which apply to each FSA. The standards/requirements may be different for each FSA. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>11.4.2 Every FSA which is subject to this Code shall comply with the standards of conduct and standards of practice contained in the main Code.</p>

<p>11.4.3 Where an FSA is subject to this Code the Regulator may also require compliance with the standards of practice contained in one, or more, of the appendices to this Code (see Part F – Appendices).</p>

<p>11.4.4 For each FSA which is subject to this Code the requirements in this Code operate from the date this Code becomes effective (the date specified in section 10). All forensic units must comply with the provisions of the Code from the effective date set out in section 10.</p>

<p>11.4.5 This Code may include provisions with regard to demonstration of compliance (either generally or for specific FSAs) which are not operative from the date this Code takes effect (i.e. the date may be set in the future). In these areas the requirements of this Code must be complied with from the Code effective date but the demonstration of compliance (e.g. by accreditation) is not required until the date specified. Forensic units should aim to achieve the requirement before the date specified.</p>

<h4>Non-Code Standards Documents</h4>

<p>11.4.6 The Regulator may work with other bodies (e.g. professional bodies or regulators) to support the production of standards or requirements for certain fields of forensic science.</p>

<p>11.4.7 Unless such documents are incorporated into this Code, they do not form part of the code issued under the provisions of s2 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<h4>Other Documents</h4>

<p>11.4.8 The Regulator may issue other documents (e.g. guidance documents). These do not form part of the Code issued under s2 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> Dealing with Changes to References</h3>

<p>11.5.1 In this Code any reference to legislation (e.g. statute or secondary legislation) shall be taken to mean the following.</p>

<p>a. The legislation as amended.</p>

<p>b. Any secondary legislation created under powers contained within the statute.</p>

<p>c. Where the legislation is repealed and replaced, the new provisions.</p>

<p>11.5.2 In this Code any reference to a Home Office Circular shall be taken to mean the following.</p>

<p>a. The Circular as amended.</p>

<p>b. If the Circular is withdrawn any Circular which replaces it.</p>

<p>11.5.3 In this Code any reference to a specific body (e.g. a Government department) shall be taken to mean the following.</p>

<p>a. The body regardless of if the name is altered.</p>

<p>b. If the body is abolished, any successor body.</p>

<h2>Part D - Standards of Conduct</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Standards of Conduct</h2>

<p>14.1.1 The Regulator sets out, for all persons carrying on any FSA to which this Code applies (and this Code specifies compliance in the FSA definition), the values and ideals the profession stands for. These Standards of Conduct provide a clear statement to commissioning parties, the CJS, and the public of what they have a right to expect.</p>

<p>14.1.2 As a person undertaking an FSA you shall.</p>

<p>1. Recognise your overriding duty is to the court and to the administration of justice. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a></p>

<p>2. Act with honesty, integrity, objectivity, and impartiality.</p>

<p>3. Comply with the legal obligations imposed on practitioners (and specifically expert witnesses) in the jurisdiction(s) in which you practice. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a></p>

<p>4. Declare, at the earliest opportunity, any personal, business, financial, and/or other interest, or situation, that could be perceived as a potential conflict of interest.</p>

<p>5. Act, and in particular provide expert advice and evidence, only within the limits of your professional competence.</p>

<p>6. Maintain and develop your professional competence, taking account of material research and developments within the relevant field.</p>

<p>7. Inform those commissioning you, in writing, of any information which may reasonably be considered to undermine your credibility as a practitioner or the reliability of the material you produce and include this information with/within any written report provided to those commissioning you.</p>

<p>8. Establish the integrity and continuity of items/exhibits as they come into your possession and ensure these are maintained whilst the items/exhibits remain in your possession.</p>

<p>9. Seek access to items/exhibits/information that may have a significant impact on the output from your work <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup> and record both the request for the items/exhibits/information and the result of that request.</p>

<p>10. Conduct casework using methods of demonstrated validity.</p>

<p>11. Be prepared to review any casework if any new information or developments are identified that would significantly impact on the output from your work. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<p>12. Where you have grounds for believing a situation may result in a miscarriage of justice, ensure that the relevant commissioning party is informed either by (a) invoking the appropriate organisational processes for addressing potential miscarriages of justice or (where you do not operate as part of an organisation or the organisation does not have appropriate procedures) (b) by informing the party directly.</p>

<p>13. Preserve confidentiality unless the law obliges, a court/tribunal orders, or a commissioning party explicitly authorises disclosure.</p>

<h2>Part E - Standards of Practice</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Application</h2>

<p>15.1.1 The Standards of Practice, subject to the point in section 15.1.2, apply to all forensic units undertaking an FSA to which this Code applies where compliance is specified in the FSA definition (see F3 - FSAs – Definitions subject to this Code).</p>

<p>15.1.2 It is recognised that the CJS may require the assistance of an expert who does not normally operate in the area of forensic science. Where such an expert is commissioned in relation to an FSA to which this Code applies, the expert shall not be subject to the provisions of the Standards of Practice set out in the main Code but shall comply with the provisions of section 40.2 (which discusses the relevant provisions with regard to Infrequently Commissioned Experts).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Management Requirements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>16.1.1 Where this Code specifies accreditation for an FSA, the forensic unit shall have a Schedule of Accreditation covering compliance with the standards identified in this Code for the aspects of the FSA it undertakes. Provisions in this Code vary this requirement with regard to Infrequently Commissioned Experts (see section 40) and/or where the provisions for infrequently used methods apply (see section 28.3.50 et seq).</p>

<p>16.1.2 The forensic unit shall define all roles that could influence the performance of the FSA undertaken and detail the competencies (see section 26.3) required for these roles.</p>

<p>16.1.3 These roles include all those performing the following as part of an FSA or identified as influencing the undertaking of the FSA.</p>

<p>a. Review of Requests, Tenders and/or Contracts (see section 21).</p>

<p>b. Support services e.g. cleaning of examination areas.</p>

<p>c. Planning and performing FSAs.</p>

<p>d. Operating analytical instruments/equipment.</p>

<p>e. Performing critical findings checks and peer review.</p>

<p>f. Signing/issuing reports.</p>

<p>g. Providing interpretations/opinion.</p>

<p>h. Software installation, authorisation for software changes and administration of firmware and software (e.g. analytical software, anti-malware software).</p>

<p>i. Development, validation, and verification of new, adopted, or adapted methods.</p>

<p>16.1.4 Where a role is supporting the delivery of the FSA but not directly undertaking the FSA (e.g. cleaning personnel with access to examination areas), role specific awareness training (e.g. security, confidentiality, integrity, contamination control) should be given and documented.</p>

<p>16.1.5 Where top management is referred to in relevant normative references (see section 11.2), this should usually be at Chief Officer or board level and, in this Code, is referred to as the Senior Accountable Individual (see 16.2).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span> Senior Accountable Individual</h3>

<h4>Appointment</h4>

<p>16.2.1 Where a forensic unit is comprised of two, or more, practitioners it shall appoint a senior manager (that being at director, partner, board level, chief officer level, or equivalent) to be the Senior Accountable Individual (SAI).</p>

<p>16.2.2 Where a forensic unit is comprised of only one practitioner that practitioner shall be the SAI.</p>

<h4>Role</h4>

<p>16.2.3 The SAI shall be accountable for the strategic leadership of the forensic unit’s compliance with this Code and be accountable for risks related to any FSA undertaken by, or under the control of, the forensic unit. There should be particular focus on any risks which could adversely affect an investigation or impede or prejudice the course of justice in any proceedings.</p>

<p>16.2.4 The 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> makes provision for circumstances where the Regulator has reason to believe or believes that a person may be undertaking a forensic science activity to which this Code applies in a way that creates a substantial risk of: <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<p>a. Adversely affecting any investigation, or</p>

<p>b. Impeding or prejudicing the course of justice in any proceedings.</p>

<p>16.2.5 The SAI shall be accountable, on behalf of the forensic unit, in relation to any investigation or compliance action by the Regulator. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>16.2.6 The SAI shall have the authority to make decisions and deploy resources to address quality matters in the forensic unit.</p>

<p>16.2.7 The name, and contact details, of the SAI shall be notified to the Regulator. The SAI will be the route through which any communications related to action under sections 5 and/or 6 of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> will be addressed. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<p>16.2.8 The forensic unit shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) notify the Regulator, of any change in the information provided about the SAI.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>16.2.9 The forensic unit shall have a document setting out the following for each SAI.</p>

<p>a. The name of the SAI.</p>

<p>b. The date of appointment of the SAI.</p>

<p>c. The responsibilities of the SAI.</p>

<p>16.2.10 The SAI shall endorse the document which sets out their role and responsibilities from the date of taking on these responsibilities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Business Continuity</h2>

<p>17.1.1 The forensic unit shall have procedures to be implemented following interruption to, or failure of, business critical processes, to maintain or restore operations and ensure availability of information (at a level which prevents significant interruption to operations), and both confidentiality and integrity of that information. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>17.1.2 The business continuity procedures shall include:</p>

<p>a. An IT incident management plan for retrieval of critical data (see section 30, Control of Data); and</p>

<p>b. Consideration of what additional supporting information would be required to support case file data (e.g. validation reports, calibration records).</p>

<p>17.1.3 A forensic unit may need to use externally provided services in the undertaking of all (or any part of) an FSA (see section 22). The commissioning forensic unit should ensure that its business continuity procedures include provision to preserve and/or recover any material transferred to (or generated in) the facility commissioned to perform the work. Where externally provided services are performed by a separate legal entity, these business continuity procedures should include the safeguards should that legal entity go out of business with no legal successor (e.g. through stipulation in a contract with the legal entity in question to assist in receivership disputes).</p>

<p>17.1.4 The business continuity procedures shall be tested, for each area of work and/or site, in proportion to risk (at least once in an accreditation cycle) and the results documented. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup> Any identified need for action to modify the plans shall be implemented and the plans re-tested.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> Independence, Impartiality and Integrity</h2>

<p>18.1.1 The forensic unit shall ensure that all of its practitioners are made aware of, and adhere to, the Standards of Conduct in respect of their independence, impartiality and integrity, and that the organisational structure, policies and procedures support this rather than hinder it.</p>

<p>18.1.2 Conflicts of interest, perceived or otherwise, and threats to impartiality may include a practitioner:</p>

<p>a. Having, or being perceived to have, an interest in the outcome of the case;</p>

<p>b. Being coerced or having the perception of being coerced, openly or secretively; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>c. Being asked to disregard critical findings that support/undermine either the prosecution’s or the defence’s position;</p>

<p>d. Being asked (except where there is a clear legal reason for doing so) to limit the information being provided to the court including, but not limited to, findings that contradict any issued report(s);</p>

<p>e. Being the sole reviewer of their critical findings;</p>

<p>f. Being involved with activities that could be perceived as witness coaching or being coached, rather than training or familiarisation;</p>

<p>g. Being over-familiar with, or trusting, another person instead of relying on objective evidence;</p>

<p>h. Having organisational and management structures that could be perceived to reward, encourage or support bias;</p>

<p>i. Having a close/significant personal or financial relationship with a party likely to be affected by the outcome of:</p>

<p>i. The practitioner’s work; and/or</p>

<p>ii. The case;</p>

<p>j. Having a close/significant personal or financial relationship with any person acting as an expert witness in the case; or</p>

<p>k. Acting in self-interest.</p>

<p>18.1.3 It is possible for a conflict of interest to arise as a result of information held by a practitioner. This could be information, perhaps obtained from other parties to the case or previous dealings with some of the parties, making it difficult for the practitioner to adhere to their obligations to the CJS or their client.</p>

<p>18.1.4 A practitioner shall declare at once where they believe a conflict of interest may take place and there shall be a policy to address this eventuality.</p>

<p>18.1.5 Practitioners giving evaluative opinion should interpret the evidence in light of the propositions set out by all parties and provide evidence in a balanced manner.</p>

<p>18.1.6 The required policies and procedures (see 18.1.1) aim to control internal and external influence on the results of the FSA performed. The process map required to assure data integrity (see 30.1.2), should be used in the development of the procedure for the FSA to ensure the correct level of information is available to a practitioner relevant to the analysis at each stage of an FSA, and if identified as a risk that non-task relevant information is controlled, i.e. held back until the stage(s) which may be influenced by extraneous information is completed. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<p>18.1.7 The required policies and procedures should also cover the corrective action (such as formal disclosure) to be taken if there is a possibility of a practitioner’s judgement having been, or perceived to have been, compromised (see also 38 - Retention, Recording, Revelation and Disclosure).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span> Confidentiality</h2>

<p>19.1.1 The forensic unit shall have documented policies and procedures detailing confidentiality (or equivalent) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup> requirements, including any disclosure requirements, and shall ensure that those requirements are applied to any externally provided services. The procedures shall address the following.</p>

<p>a. The material held by the forensic unit which is subject to an obligation of confidentiality.</p>

<p>b. The nature of the confidentiality obligation and its application to all personnel and external service providers.</p>

<p>c. The potential legal liability for breach of confidentiality.</p>

<p>d. The conditions that may allow the confidentiality to be waived or legally overridden and the process the forensic unit shall follow in such circumstances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span> Document Control</h2>

<p>20.1.1 The forensic unit shall apply document/version control procedures to the following where they are integral to the forensic process, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>a. Both hard copy and electronic copies;</p>

<p>b. Procedures – technical and quality;</p>

<p>c. Software;</p>

<p>d. Technical methods;</p>

<p>e. Forms;</p>

<p>f. Locally held copies of key external documents; and</p>

<p>g. Statutory documents (e.g. licences for possession of materials such as drugs or firearms).</p>

<p>20.1.2 The retention period for obsolete/superseded documents should be defined and should take into account commissioning party <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">22</a>, regulatory <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup> and legal requirements. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span> Review of Requests, Tenders and/or Contracts</h2>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>21.1.1 This is the formal process of agreeing and recording the commissioning party’s and forensic unit’s interaction when requesting or tasking. Typically, where the commissioning party is external to the forensic unit, a commercial arrangement is entered into. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup> With internal parties this may be a request managed through some other work order control system. This Code does not seek to govern how commercial arrangements are entered into, only how work is controlled, and instructions are captured.</p>

<p>21.1.2 The processes surrounding the review of requests, tenders and/or contracts may occur at several different levels and at several key stages through the processing of forensic work. Any review taking place at whatever level shall be documented.</p>

<p>21.1.3 The issues to be addressed shall include how the following will apply before the work commences.</p>

<p>a. Whether the forensic unit can legally perform the work (e.g. does it have all required licences etc).</p>

<p>b. Whether the forensic unit has sufficient resource (amount and competence) to manage work and meet the requirements of the CJS.</p>

<p>c. Whether the forensic unit meets the standards required for the work and the necessary means of demonstrating compliance.</p>

<p>d. Whether the practitioners have the level of background checks (e.g. security checks) the commissioning party requires for the work (see section 26).</p>

<p>e. Whether the proposed work would properly address the issues for the CJS.</p>

<p>21.1.4 A documented policy is required, which shall include recording of all relevant instances when work requirements are discussed and reviewed such that a demonstrable audit trail, including appropriate justifications and authorisations, is available for each piece of work undertaken.</p>

<h4>Developing an Examination Strategy</h4>

<p>21.1.5 The purpose of an examination strategy is to ensure that the FSA, or suite of FSAs, being applied is appropriate to the investigative questions to be addressed. This may include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Identifying whether a crime has been committed;</p>

<p>b. Identifying or eliminating a suspect;</p>

<p>c. Validating the accounts of suspects, complainants, or witnesses; and/or</p>

<p>d. Establishing the sequence of events.</p>

<p>21.1.6 Prior to commencing work the forensic unit shall, in consultation with the commissioning party, identify the issue(s) in the case, develop an appropriate examination strategy, indicate the FSAs being proposed, sequence of sampling and/or examination, and agree the timescale for the delivery of the results. This may be in an overarching service level agreement (SLA)/contract for more routine casework.</p>

<p>21.1.7 In developing the examination strategy, as appropriate and as far as is practicable, the practitioner shall:</p>

<p>a. Ensure the relevant requirements of the commissioning party and associated examination strategy are understood;</p>

<p>b. Ensure that either all the necessary information (including on any previous examinations), and/or information about secondary scenes and/or items/exhibits required for an effective examination strategy are provided or that any resultant limitations to the scope of the examination are discussed with the commissioning party and made clear to the CJS;</p>

<p>c. Establish all relevant details of the incident, including: <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a></p>

<p>i. The incident type and how this influences the scale of the examination; and</p>

<p>ii. What items/exhibits will or have been recovered for examination, the circumstances relating to the location and recovery of the items/exhibits.</p>

<p>d. Determine the facilities and techniques/equipment required;</p>

<p>e. Select and prioritise the examinations according to the needs of the criminal investigation, the commissioning solicitor, and/or the CJS, with consideration to the scenes and/or items/exhibits available.</p>

<p>i. Determine the sequence of examinations and/or of sampling of the items/exhibits with reference to potential cross contamination of scenes or items or loss of integrity of the items/exhibits prior to arrival at scene or coming into the practitioner’s possession.</p>

<h4>Evaluative Opinions</h4>

<p>21.1.8 Where the forensic unit is commissioned to provide evaluative opinions the following provisions of this section apply.</p>

<p>21.1.9 The expert needs sufficient case-specific information to determine appropriate propositions, select appropriate analyses, and to interpret the observations from those analyses. Other than that information, the expert does not need, and should not see, any more case-specific information (such as information on previous convictions, reasons unrelated to the scientific analysis why investigators have identified a suspect, and any other extraneous information not relevant to the expert’s task). <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">23</a></p>

<p>21.1.10 The expert shall:</p>

<p>a. Consider the questions being asked by the commissioning party in the case and identify the issue(s) their analysis can address;</p>

<p>b. Consider all available, relevant case-specific information and, where necessary, request additional information; and</p>

<p>c. Discuss the issues to be addressed and potential propositions with the relevant commissioning party and where possible the other party. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup></p>

<p>21.1.11 On the basis of the case circumstances and any agreed key issue(s), the following, where they have been put forward by the prosecution and defence (or their representatives), shall be identified.</p>

<p>a. The prosecution proposition(s).</p>

<p>b. The defence proposition(s).</p>

<p>21.1.12 There may be more than two propositions, but the assessment will, in general, consider the propositions in pairs; each pair shall be mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>c. Notification by a third party; and/or</p>

<p>d. Information in the public domain (e.g. a court judgment or media reports).</p>

<p>23.3.2 The Regulator’s response to such quality issues depends on the nature of the issues and their potential impact. The options include, but are not limited to, the following.</p>

<p>a. To work with the forensic unit as part of the normal quality monitoring process to determine the nature of the issues and the appropriate response to reviews into non-conforming work.</p>

<p>b. To initiate an investigation under the provisions of s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<p>c. To initiate compliance action under the provisions of s6 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<p>23.3.3 The manner in which the Regulator deals with the appropriate response is set out in the published policy ### <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">24</a>.</p>

<p>23.3.4 The following parts of section 23.3 sets out what the Regulator expects of forensic units when any quality issues are being considered by the Regulator.</p>

<h4>Monitoring of Quality</h4>

<p>23.3.5 Where the Regulator is considering a potential quality issue in a forensic unit, once the forensic unit is notified of this, the forensic unit shall:</p>

<p>a. Co-operate with the Regulator to the maximum extent possible;</p>

<p>b. Provide, as far as permitted by law, all information sought by the Regulator, or potentially relevant to the Regulator’s consideration; and</p>

<p>c. Ensure sufficient resources are employed to address the issue in an agreed timescale.</p>

<h4>Regulator’s Investigations [s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>]</h4>

<p>23.3.6 Where it is appropriate to initiate an investigation into any aspect of the work of a forensic unit, the forensic unit shall (when notified), in addition to the requirements set out above in relation to monitoring (see section 23.3.5):</p>

<p>a. Familiarise itself with the provisions of s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>;</p>

<p>b. Ensure that all representatives involved in the Regulator’s investigation are:</p>

<p>i. Aware of the provisions of s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>;</p>

<p>ii. Aware of the potential consequences of non-compliance with notices issued under s5 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<h4>Compliance Action [s6-8 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>]</h4>

<p>a. Familiarise itself with the provisions of sections 6-8 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>;</p>

<p>b. Ensure all representatives involved in the Regulator’s investigation are:</p>

<p>i. Aware of the provisions of sections 6-8 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>;</p>

<p>ii. Aware of the consequences of non-compliance with any notice issued.</p>

<h4>Reporting</h4>

<p>23.3.8 The existence of a Regulator’s investigation or compliance action (i.e. the issue of a compliance notice, the application for and/or granting of an injunction, the initiation of contempt proceedings or finding of contempt) may need to be disclosed in reports. Similarly, the fact that a Regulator’s investigation or compliance action has previously taken place may need to be disclosed in reports. This is discussed in section 36.1.5.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">24. </span> Control of Records</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">24.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>24.1.1 The forensic unit shall establish retention times that satisfy the requirements of legislation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup>, its accrediting body, the party commissioning the work <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">22</a> and this Code.</p>

<p>24.1.2 Records shall be stored and subsequently disposed of in a manner appropriate to their sensitivity and/or protective marking (e.g. incinerated or shredded to a specified standard which has been notified to the commissioning party).</p>

<p>24.1.3 Protective marking (e.g. with a Government Security Classification <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">25</a>) does not, by itself, provide an exemption to disclosure obligations. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">26</a></p>

<p>24.1.4 Where records are distributed across systems and/or locations, the forensic unit shall have a procedure to be able to retrieve and collate records required for reporting cases. The procedure shall detail the data types covered (see also procedural requirements in 30 - Control of Data).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">24.2 </span> Technical Records</h3>

<p>24.2.1 As a minimum, the technical records <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup> shall contain all relevant information relating to the following.</p>

<p>a. The collection and movement of material (physical items/exhibits, data and records), including:</p>

<p>i. The date (and time when critical) on which the material was taken or received;</p>

<p>ii. The date (and time when critical) of movement of the material to another party;</p>

<p>iii. From whom or where and to whom or where the material was moved; and</p>

<p>iv. The means by which the material was received or passed from/to another party (see 34 - Handling of Items/Exhibits).</p>

<p>b. Sufficient relevant detail to be able to trace any analytical output to:</p>

<p>i. A specific instrument;</p>

<p>ii. Instrument configuration, e.g. software version or, if relevant, firmware;</p>

<p>iii. The operator; and</p>

<p>d. Verbal and other communications, including reports.</p>

<p>e. Meetings attended and telephone conversations, including points of agreement or disagreement, and agreed actions.</p>

<p>f. Emails and other electronic transmissions (e.g. images) sent or received.</p>

<p>24.2.2 The records, in whatever form, shall be clear and comprehensive, and expressed in such a manner and in sufficient detail that another practitioner in the same field, and in the absence of the original practitioner, can follow the nature of the work undertaken, any interpretations/opinions made, and the inferences drawn from the work. This is particularly important in situations where re-examination (e.g. at scenes) is not possible, there is an insufficient quantity of the items/exhibit remaining for independent re-examination or testing, or the form of the items/exhibit is altered.</p>

<p>24.2.3 Technical records shall be produced contemporaneously with the examination. Where this is demonstrably not practicable, the reasons behind this and the risks shall be recorded, in the records when they are made. The practitioner shall begin making records from the time commission is received and shall continue making records throughout their involvement in the case. If there is any discussion about the case, or advice on tasking or submission was sought, prior or during contract review it may be appropriate to start making records before receiving formal instructions from the commissioning party.</p>

<p>24.2.4 Photography may be used as parts of contemporaneous notes. There shall be a procedure in place for its use, which shall draw distinction between record and evidential photography.</p>

<p>24.2.5 When a request for an examination is rejected, an item is rejected at submission, or a test result or report is rejected, the reasons for the original rejection shall be recorded, even if in the case of a report it is to be replaced.</p>

<p>24.2.6 For the period of record retention, traceability shall be maintained for all names, initials and/or identifiers. These should be legible and understandable.</p>

<p>24.2.7 It shall be possible to associate all changes to critical data with the person having made those changes. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup> Reasons for the changes shall be recorded.</p>

<p>24.2.8 Hard copy records generated by the forensic unit used as part of the case file shall use a system which indicates completeness, for example through pagination using a page numbering system which indicates the total number of pages or an index sheet with this information. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup></p>

<p>a. Each page of every document in the case record shall be traceable to the practitioner responsible for the sampling and/or performance of each examination or test, to a uniquely identified case and uniquely identified item/exhibit. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup></p>

<p>b. It shall be clear from the case record who has performed all stages of the analysis or examination and when each stage of the analysis or examination was performed.</p>

<p>c. Alterations or comments in the records shall be clear and be signed, or otherwise be attributable to the individual who made them and dated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">24.3 </span> Checking and Primary Review</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>24.3.1 The forensic unit shall have a procedure for checking and primary review. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup> For methods that require calculations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup> and/or critical data transfers (see 30.1.2) that are not part of a validated electronic process, the procedure shall include a requirement for effective checks of those calculations and/or critical data transfers to be carried out.</p>

<p>24.3.2 The forensic unit shall have a procedure for carrying out checks on critical findings and designate competent individuals authorised to carry out such checks. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup> Where checks on critical findings are carried out, the records shall indicate that each critical finding has been checked and whether it was agreed, or not and by whom and when the checks were performed. The procedure should include a process for resolving any discordant results or findings.</p>

<p>24.3.3 Where the forensic unit has deemed <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> the procedure requires an independent check, the unit should define this level of independence <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup> and records should be kept to demonstrate this.</p>

<p>24.3.4 The forensic unit shall, when such reviews are undertaken, have documented policies and procedures for the administrative review <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup> of case records including reports. The administrative review shall establish that the records/reports comply with the forensic unit’s policies with regard to administrative content and structure of such records.</p>

<p>24.3.5 The forensic unit shall have documented policies and procedures and authorised practitioners for the peer review of case records including reports. The review shall establish from the case notes and discussion with the practitioner that the work carried out is:</p>

<p>a. Appropriate to the requirements of the case;</p>

<p>b. Fully documented in the case notes, with appropriate checks on critical findings, calculations, and data transfers;</p>

<p>c. In compliance with the forensic unit’s documented policies and procedures; and</p>

<p>d. Consistent with the contents of the report.</p>

<p>24.3.6 In all reviews, the case record shall indicate that the review has been carried out, by whom and when.</p>

<p>24.3.7 The checks and reviews shall be recorded as entries against each finding or on a summary of findings or on a report, as appropriate.</p>

<p>24.3.8 If the checker/reviewer disagrees on any point and the matter cannot be resolved, records of the disagreed content, the reason(s) for the disagreement, and any action taken as a result shall be recorded.</p>

<h4>Difference Resolution</h4>

<p>24.3.9 The review or primary checking process may lead to a difference of opinion between the initial and reviewing practitioner. The forensic unit shall have a documented procedure for resolving or reaching a conclusion in such cases.</p>

<p>24.3.10 The procedure noted in section 24.3.9 shall ensure the obligations in relation to disclosure to the CJS are discharged <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">25. </span> Internal Audits</h2>

<p>25.1.1 The annual audit programme shall cover all aspects of the management system. This shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Implementation of the management system, including the implementation of technical methods;</p>

<p>b. Records of individual files; and</p>

<p>c. Security and integrity of information and data (also 30.3 - Electronic Information Security).</p>

<p>25.1.2 A risk assessment-based approach should be taken to determine the frequency of the audit schedule, and this should be documented, but methods shall be audited at least once every four-year cycle. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup></p>

<p>25.1.3 Where the forensic unit undertakes to make statements of opinions and interpretations, the audits shall include a review of the process by which these are made and of the competence requirements of the individuals authorised to make such statements.</p>

<p>25.1.4 Where examination and testing activities are delivered from a number of different operational sites, the internal audits shall cover all sites and all aspects of the management system.</p>

<p>25.1.5 When the results of the audit cast doubt on the effectiveness of examinations, or the correctness or validity of the forensic unit’s results to the extent that misleading information may have been reported, the forensic unit shall treat the audit result as a non-conforming result.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">26. </span> Personnel Requirements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>26.1.1 The forensic unit shall ensure appropriate background checks (e.g. security checks) have been completed on all candidates for employment and contractors in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and ethics. These checks shall be proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information to be accessed, and the perceived risks. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote">[footnote 56]</a></sup> The forensic unit shall ensure appropriate security clearance is maintained by all staff and contractors.</p>

<p>26.1.2 The commissioning party shall be notified of the level of background checks held in the forensic unit by staff with access to the data and items/exhibits to allow a determination of whether the level is acceptable during the review of requests, tenders and contracts (see section 21 - Review of Requests, Tenders and/or Contracts).</p>

<p>26.1.3 The contracts for all staff, permanent and temporary, shall contain confidentiality agreements<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote">[footnote 57]</a></sup>, setting out their own and the forensic unit’s responsibility for information security, and details of their expected conduct.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.2 </span> Standards of Conduct</h3>

<p>26.2.1 The forensic unit shall have a Code of Conduct compatible with the Standards of Conduct provided in section 14. Practitioners shall be made familiar with how the Code of Conduct relates to their role in the administration of justice and details of how this was achieved shall be recorded.</p>

<p>26.2.2 There is no specific requirement for familiarisation with the Standards of Conduct for personnel not directly conducting any aspect of an FSA, supporting the delivery of FSAs, or with legitimate access to examination areas, items, or records. However, such personnel should be made familiar with relevant issues to their role and access permissions such as security, continuity, contamination control, security and confidentiality requirements as set out in 26.1.3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.3 </span> Competence</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>26.3.1 The forensic unit shall determine and document the requirements for competence and ongoing competence for each role, as set out in section 16, including the competencies required for reporting findings.</p>

<p>26.3.2 The forensic unit shall determine the appropriate competence framework for practitioners <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote">[footnote 58]</a></sup>, this should include the following.</p>

<p>a. Education.</p>

<p>b. Qualification.</p>

<p>26.3.3 The forensic unit shall have processes to address the following.</p>

<p>a. Remedial actions when competence is found to have lapsed or not been demonstrated. See also 23.1 - Control of Non-Conforming FSA Related Work.</p>

<p>b. Remedial actions required should there be an event which undermines the credibility of a practitioner or the forensic unit. Such events may include, but not be limited to, the following.</p>

<p>i. Judicial criticism.</p>

<p>ii. Complaints.</p>

<p>iii. Criticism by a professional body.</p>

<p>iv. Criticism by the Regulator.</p>

<h4>Competence Required for Reporting</h4>

<p>26.3.4 Forensic units shall ensure that all practitioners who report factual evidence based on scientific methodology are aware of the following.</p>

<p>a. Whether there is any relevant specialist literature relating to the field;</p>

<p>b. That the principles, techniques and assumptions they have relied on are valid;</p>

<p>c. Where factual reporting in the FSA ends, and where evidence of opinion begins;</p>

<p>d. That they must be able to demonstrate that the assumptions they have relied upon are reasonable; and</p>

<p>e. The impact of the uncertainty of measurement associated with the application of a given method.</p>

<p>26.3.5 Forensic units shall ensure that all practitioners who provide reports have a sufficient level of skill, experience, knowledge, and, where appropriate, qualifications, relevant to the type of evidence being adduced, to give credibility to the reliability of the work undertaken and the conclusions drawn. Practitioners shall also ensure that they are able to explain their methodology and reasoning, both in writing and orally, which should be concise in a way that is comprehensible to a lay person and not misleading.</p>

<p>26.3.6 In determining competence, the forensic unit shall consider whether any issues, other than those listed in section 26.3.5, would call into question the competence of an otherwise apparently suitable individual. Relevant issues include, but are not limited to, the following (if upheld).</p>

<p>a. Adverse judicial comments.</p>

<p>b. Adverse findings by the Regulator.</p>

<p>c. Adverse findings by professional or regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>26.3.7 Forensic units shall ensure that all practitioners who provide evidence including opinion based on their practical experience and/or their professional knowledge are additionally able to provide: <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote">[footnote 59]</a></sup></p>

<p>a. An explanation of their methodology and reasoning;</p>

<p>b. Reference to a body of up to date specialised literature relating to the field of expertise and the extent to which this supports or undermines their methodology and reasoning;</p>

<p>c. An assessment that any database they have relied on is relevant and sufficient in size and quality to justify the nature and breadth of inferences drawn from it, that the inferences are logically sound and that alternative hypotheses in the investigative mode and alternative propositions in the evaluative mode have been properly considered;</p>

<p>d. A demonstration that their methodology, assumptions, and reasoning have been considered by other scientists and are regarded as sound, or, where challenged, the concerns have been satisfactorily addressed;</p>

<p>e. An assessment of the extent to which their methodology and reasoning are accepted by their peers, together with details of any outstanding concerns;</p>

<p>f. Relevant information to support claims of expertise, as well as anything that may adversely affect credibility or competence (e.g. adverse judicial findings); <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">26</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:60" rel="footnote">[footnote 60]</a></sup> and</p>

<p>g. The statement of understanding and truth in expert reports for the CJS in England and Wales, as required in Criminal Practice Directions V 19B (see 36.1.10 and Criminal Practice Directions v 19B.1.13) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a>.</p>

<p>26.3.8 Expertise cannot be simply measured in years, number of cases examined, educational achievements, post-nominals, or seniority, nor is it equivalent to credibility. The broad range of case circumstances encountered in any discipline of forensic science means that a particular expert will have more relevant skill, experience, and expertise in some cases than in others.</p>

<p>a. The competence of each expert shall be assessed in each discipline in which they claim expertise, and thereafter monitored at appropriate intervals.</p>

<p>b. To comply with their obligations under Criminal Procedure Rules (CrimPR) 19.4 (b) and (f), experts should remain up to date with their knowledge of the scientific literature relevant to their field.</p>

<p>c. Experts should participate in regular evaluation of their expertise <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">28</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">29</a> through, for example, proficiency tests that are representative of the complexity encountered in casework.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26.4 </span> Competence Records</h3>

<p>26.4.1 The forensic unit and/or individual practitioners conducting FSAs shall maintain, and keep readily available, records of education, training, skills, and experience in sufficient detail to provide evidence of proper training and formal competence assessment. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote">[footnote 61]</a></sup> These records shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Academic and/or professional qualifications;</p>

<p>b. Internal/external courses attended;</p>

<p>c. Relevant training/retraining received whilst employed by the forensic unit;</p>

<p>d. Any subsequent remedial action from any substantive complaints, errors, or adverse judicial comments;</p>

<p>f. The tasks for which the individual has been assessed as competent and authorised to carry out;</p>

<p>g. The date(s) on which competence and authorisation were confirmed; and</p>

<p>h. The date(s) on which competence and authorisation lapsed or were removed.</p>

<p>26.4.2 The manner in which competence is achieved, demonstrated, and maintained shall be documented, and the forensic unit shall have a policy for retention of training manuals, training and competence assessment records in line with the policy for retention of case files.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">27. </span> Environment where the FSA is Undertaken</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.1 </span> Examination Facilities</h3>

<p>27.1.1 An examination facility is one where appropriate environmental conditions can be achieved and maintained for the optimum performance of a given technique. Such a facility is not necessarily at a fixed location and may include dedicated mobile facilities. A scene of an incident, and the vehicles used solely for transporting persons and their equipment, are not examination facilities in this context as each is an uncontrolled environment.</p>

<p>27.1.2 The examination facilities shall include, as appropriate (to the work being undertaken):</p>

<p>a. Suitable accommodation, appliances (e.g. laboratory benches, safety cabinets, refrigerators, freezers) and space (per employee) to carry out the work to the required standard safely and without contamination;</p>

<p>b. Provision of appropriate environmental conditions (e.g. lighting, temperature, humidity, ventilation/air flow) required to facilitate correct performance of examinations or tests, and not adversely affect the required quality of any measurement or invalidate results;</p>

<p>c. Proportionate protection against likely risks, such as arson, theft, or interference with items/exhibits;</p>

<p>d. Archive/storage facilities with adequate storage conditions to prevent loss, deterioration, and contamination, and to maintain the integrity and identity of documents/records/items/exhibits before, during, and after examinations or tests have been performed; and</p>

<p>e. Facilities for the secure disposal of confidential waste and the safe disposal of hazardous materials.</p>

<h4>Dedicated Facilities</h4>

<p>27.1.3 The access and use of item/exhibit storage areas and server rooms should be controlled in addition to areas where work is carried out. The forensic unit shall hold on record a list of all staff who are authorised to enter these areas. This shall be reviewed regularly and updated where appropriate.</p>

<p>27.1.4 Delivery and loading areas, and other points where unauthorised persons may enter the building, shall be isolated from casework and information processing areas and access shall also be controlled. Unauthorised persons needing to enter controlled areas shall be escorted at all times by authorised staff and a record of these entries shall be maintained.</p>

<h4>Non-Dedicated Work Areas</h4>

<p>27.1.5 It is recognised that, other than for traditional laboratory work with inherent need for contamination control, the forensic unit may authorise parts of the FSA to be performed in a place that is not dedicated or primarily designed for that purpose (e.g. home working). <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote">[footnote 62]</a></sup> Where the forensic unit is expected to hold accreditation for performing the FSA, the forensic unit shall consult with the accreditation body prior to authorisation to ensure all implications are considered, and any impact on the forensic unit’s accreditation status has been assessed.</p>

<p>27.1.6 The forensic unit shall also consider and record, prior to authorising, where the FSA is being conducted, and how the security of the information and the integrity and identity of documents/records/test items/exhibits is maintained before, during and after examinations or tests have been performed.</p>

<p>27.1.7 The risk assessment required in 30.1.2 should be used to identify the critical control points and the controls to be maintained and may be used in the authorisation process.</p>

<p>27.1.8 The forensic unit shall document the controls being used, even if normal good practice requirements such as clear desk policies, restricting the amount of information held off site, or any other generic mitigation steps the practitioner apply. The forensic unit shall identify how it will assure compliance and/or include within its internal audit.</p>

<p>27.2.2 The steps in establishing procedures relevant to data ‘contamination’ control are detailed as data integrity issues in section 30.1 which includes a similar hazard or risk-based analysis of the entire method as is detailed in 27.2.2 a-e for trace evidence. The remainder of this section refers to trace evidence; for trace evidence the steps shall include <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:63" rel="footnote">[footnote 63]</a></sup> but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Conducting a hazard or risk-based analysis of the entire method with respect to contamination (e.g. process mapping);</p>

<p>b. Identifying critical control points in the process where contamination events could occur (e.g. consumable selection, transfers, etc.) and for these critical control points:</p>

<p>i. Establish acceptable contamination control limits at each point;</p>

<p>ii. Establish monitoring requirements (e.g. frequency); and</p>

<p>iii. Establish preventative and corrective actions (e.g. when acceptable or control limits are found to be exceeded).</p>

<p>c. Establishing effective methods for both routine and deep cleaning/decontamination of equipment, facilities and surfaces;</p>

<p>d. Establishing requirements for record keeping; and</p>

<p>e. Establishing procedures for verifying that the contamination control process remains fit for purpose.</p>

<p>b. Effective separation <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:64" rel="footnote">[footnote 64]</a></sup> of incompatible activities to prevent cross-contamination. This includes, but is not limited to, the handling of:</p>

<p>i. Un-amplified and amplified DNA;</p>

<p>ii. High and low-level drugs work;</p>

<p>iii. Toxicology work involving samples likely to have high and low levels of drugs;</p>

<p>iv. Examination of firearms and firearm discharge residues;</p>

<p>v. Examination of accelerant and fire scene debris; and</p>

<p>vi. Examination of items/exhibits from suspects, complainants, and scenes. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote">[footnote 65]</a></sup></p>

<p>c. Policy on use of disposable equipment in specified areas and/or performing specific FSAs (e.g. gloves, face masks and mop caps).</p>

<p>d. Testing of consumables and chemicals in all stages of the examination/analytical processes and, where appropriate, testing for specific contaminants that could interfere with the success or interpretation of the examination or test (see also 27.2.2).</p>

<p>e. Good working practices, such as:</p>

<p>i. Protecting items/exhibits in wrapping/containers when not being worked on or used;</p>

<p>ii. Using only new or suitably cleaned equipment to remove solvent, standard, or reagent from stock bottles;</p>

<p>iii. Not pouring unused portions of solvent, standard, or reagent back into bulk supplies; and</p>

<p>iv. Frequent changing of solvent used for rinsing equipment.</p>

<p>f. Good housekeeping practices.</p>

<p>g. The selection and analysis of blank controls.</p>

<p>h. Environmental sampling/monitoring with particular reference to acceptable levels of relevant potential contaminants. This should include equipment, work areas, consumables, and clothing to ensure that any contamination of accommodation and/or equipment that does occur is recognised and controlled.</p>

<p>i. Using methods for both routine and deep cleaning/decontamination which include consideration of the following:</p>

<p>i. The nature of contaminants relevant to the operation of the FSA and/or the forensic unit;</p>

<p>iii. The materials/chemicals appropriate for use in contamination control;</p>

<p>iv. Appropriate training and competence of staff deployed in cleaning/decontamination processes; and</p>

<p>v. Governance and oversight by senior management.</p>

<p>27.2.4 The policies and procedures shall ensure access to areas, other than scenes of incidents, where FSAs are undertaken is restricted to authorised individuals.</p>

<p>27.2.5 The forensic unit shall identify areas of work, including scenes of incidents, where personnel are required to provide samples, for elimination databases relevant to the nature of the work undertaken in areas they access (e.g. biological material/DNA recovery and analysis, friction ridge detail recovery) and any results found in casework screened. These databases may be locally or remotely maintained.</p>

<p>27.2.6 Policies and procedures for elimination databases of staff, internal/external visitors, and equipment suppliers should include, but are not limited to:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28. </span> Methods and Method Validation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>28.1.1 All technical methods and procedures used by a forensic unit shall be fit for purpose, this is demonstrated by method validation.</p>

<p>28.1.2 This involves establishing that the method operates in the expected manner, that the limitations of the method are properly understood, that the planned use of the method is appropriate, and that the approach to reporting is logical.</p>

<p>28.1.3 Validation allows a proper understanding of the risks involved in the use of a method.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.2 </span> Selection of Methods</h3>

<p>28.2.1 This section details the principles of the requirement for validated methods, the next section, 28.3 - Validation of Methods, details the required processes.</p>

<p>28.2.2 Even where a method is considered standard and is in widespread use, scientific validity will still need to be demonstrated. The topic of verification of the validation of adopted methods is discussed below, although many of the other validation steps are likely also to apply. If a method is being newly included in the forensic unit’s scope of accreditation and validation has not been conducted at the laboratory site where it is to be implemented, the forensic unit will have to follow the adopted methods procedure, which ends in the production of a validation library and statement of completion as well as demonstrating the method works in their hands.</p>

<p>28.2.3 If a method requires the use of portable equipment (i.e. equipment intended to be used at different locations) for any reason, the validation study shall include testing any additional controls as well as assessing any additional aspects that may impact on the tests. For ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> applications see, for example, Process Requirements section 7.1.1 in UKAS-RG 201 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">17</a> (including, but not limited to temperature, humidity, surfaces, cross reactivity, lighting, cross contamination control, handling controls).</p>

<p>28.2.4 The forensic unit should have validated the method (including the equipment) prior to use in casework in accordance with the requirements of this Code. If the implementation plan requires a period of pilot after the validation study for the validation to be considered complete, such as might be the case for novel <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:66" rel="footnote">[footnote 66]</a></sup> techniques, non-routine, or infrequently used methods, or if there is any other deviation from the validation requirements set out in this Code, the forensic unit should ensure that the status of the validation for the product, method, or service is clearly understood by the commissioning party prior to agreeing use in casework.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28.3 </span> Validation of Methods</h3>

<p>28.3.1 The forensic unit shall use methods of demonstrable validity (see the Standards of Conduct in section 14).</p>

<p>28.3.2 Validation should be conducted prior to implementation of the method. This may be performed in its entirety by the forensic unit, or the studies to produce the data may be performed by the manufacturer or another forensic unit; in which case the forensic unit implementing the method shall review the data to determine if it is adequate, reliable, and relevant to the purpose it intends for the method (see Verification of the Validation of Adopted Methods 28.3.41 to 28.3.47).</p>

<p>28.3.3 If the validation has not been conducted at the site that will be using the method, the forensic unit shall verify the scope of the validation with the required steps in 28.3.7; except where the method has been validated for incident scene use and is being used at an incident scene (see, for example, UKAS-RG 201 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">17</a>). This may be scaled up or down according to the adequacy and relevance of the available existing validation study. In such cases, following review of validation data to determine if the validation is adequate, the forensic unit’s practitioners trained and signed off as competent in the method shall demonstrate such adopted methods perform reliably at the given location by following the validation process. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:67" rel="footnote">[footnote 67]</a></sup> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">33</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">34</a></p>

<p>28.3.4 The validation policy or procedure shall set out roles and responsibilities of practitioners involved in conducting validation, authorisation of key stages, and reviewing outcomes.</p>

<p>28.3.5 To ensure validation studies are conducted on the final method, there should be a clear boundary between development and validation. It is important that any significant unexpected outcomes are not corrected during validation, but that the method is declared to have failed validation. Following such a failure either:</p>

<p>a. The method shall be abandoned; or</p>

<p>b. The method shall be amended (if that is possible while maintaining the required standards), and validation repeated. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:68" rel="footnote">[footnote 68]</a></sup></p>

<p>28.3.6 If a method is amended during validation, then the validation is invalid. The procedure should include consideration of how to prevent inadvertent re-entering of the development process once validation has started.</p>

<p>28.3.7 The validation procedure shall include where relevant, but is not limited to:</p>

<p>a. Determining the end-user’s requirements;</p>

<p>b. Determining the specification;</p>

<p>c. Risk assessment of the method;</p>

<p>d. A review of the end-user’s requirements and specification;</p>

<p>e. Setting the acceptance criteria;</p>

<p>f. The validation plan;</p>

<p>g. The outcomes of the validation exercise;</p>

<p>h. Assessment of acceptance criteria compliance;</p>

<p>i. Validation report;</p>

<p>j. Statement of validation completion; and</p>

<p>k. Implementation plan.</p>

<p>28.3.8 In certain circumstances implemented methods will require revalidation, e.g. when:</p>

<p>a. Quality control indicates that an established method is changing with time;</p>

<p>b. Equipment that was not validated to be mobile or portable is moved to a new location;</p>

<p>c. Deficiencies have become apparent after the method has been implemented; or</p>

<p>d. The end-user identifies a change in requirement.</p>

<h4>Determining the End-User’s Requirements</h4>

<p>28.3.9 The process of innovation ending in the implementation of a validated method is more likely to be instigated by the forensic unit than the end-user. However, the requirements of all end users (e.g. other practitioners, investigators, prosecutors, and the CJS) must be considered. To meet the needs of the CJS, the expectations of the court (e.g. Criminal Practice Directions <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a> V 19A.5, relevant case law <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a>) need to be determined.</p>

<p>28.3.10 The amount of direct input from the CJS end-user should be determined by the forensic unit, based on the type of innovation; certain requirements may be generic and form a set of core requirements to the casework type.</p>

<p>28.3.11 The Criminal Practice Directions V (i.e. 19A.5) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a> that supplement Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a> should be considered as providing an insight as to the expectations of the CJS end-user. These expectations apply regardless of whether the result is evidence of fact or opinion.</p>

<p>28.3.12 The end-user’s requirement shall take account of, as appropriate:</p>

<p>a. Who will operate or use the new method, product, or service post-delivery, and in what environment;</p>

<p>b. What the new method or product is intended to deliver to the end-user’s;</p>

<p>c. What statutory and regulatory requirements related to development and use of the method or product apply;</p>

<p>d. Whether there are any compatibility issues to be considered, e.g. data output formats;</p>

<p>e. What level of quality performance is expected; and</p>

<p>f. By what date the new method, product, or service is required for implementation.</p>

<p>28.3.13 End-user’s requirements should conform to the following rules:</p>

<p>a. Each requirement is a single statement;</p>

<p>b. Each requirement is testable;</p>

<p>c. Each requirement specifies something that the solution will do, not how it will do it;</p>

<p>d. Each requirement specifies in its wording whether it is mandatory or desirable; and</p>

<p>e. Each requirement is written in a language that can be understood by the non-technical stakeholders.</p>

<p>28.3.14 Where the method is part of a service to be provided to a specified commissioning party, the forensic unit shall also ensure their formal agreement of the method selection.</p>

<h4>Determining the Specification</h4>

<p>28.3.15 A detailed specification shall be written for the method and shall include the technical quality standards. It may be an extension of the end-user’s requirements document or a separate document.</p>

<p>28.3.16 The specification adds detail to the requirements captured in end-user requirement from the range of users. It also draws in other technical requirements and is ultimately what is to be tested, encapsulating what this method is to do, the configuration, and what the method can and cannot be used for.</p>

<p>28.3.17 At this stage the list contained in the ILAC-G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> (3.10) should be considered, even if the points listed were not explicitly raised in the end-user requirement capture exercise. The specification may also draw on technical details from a review of the scientific literature.</p>

<h4>Risk Assessment of the Method</h4>

<p>28.3.18 Once the method has been designed or determined, there shall be an assessment to identify any risks, or potential risks, to the CJS related to the use of the method or amendment to the method, including ad hoc methods. The process shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Identifying, on the basis of the use to which the results may be put, the possible impact on the CJS of any errors in the results, associated materials or procedures; and</p>

<p>b. Identifying areas where the operation of the method, or interpretation of the results, requires specialist skills or knowledge to prevent ambiguous or misleading outputs or outcomes.</p>

<p>28.3.19 The forensic unit should define the risk assessment method it will use. This Code requires risk assessment in various sections including in contamination (see section 27.2.2) and control of data (see section 30.1.2). The methodology recommended in both is based upon process mapping and identifying the critical control points for the risks or failure modes <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:69" rel="footnote">[footnote 69]</a></sup> at those stages. One process map may be used to cover the whole method against different risks, and may be used to evaluate, or at least identify, potential contributions to uncertainty.</p>

<p>28.3.20 Where the method relies on a scientific model or theory, the risk assessment should address the following in a forensic science context:</p>

<p>a. The validity of the theory/model;</p>

<p>b. Any assumptions incorporated within the theory/model; and</p>

<p>c. Limits on the application of the theory/model.</p>

<p>28.3.21 In light of the assessment there shall be recommendations for modification of the specification, specific studies to be included in the validation exercise, or additional procedures and/or safeguards that should be implemented. Examples would include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Caveats about the use of the method;</p>

<p>b. Circumstances in which the use of the method would be inadvisable; and</p>

<p>c. Additional work that should be undertaken in combination with the method.</p>

<p>28.3.22 Where items/exhibits provided by an end-user, or data derived from these, are required for the development work or validation, the forensic unit shall obtain prior permission, from those with responsibility for the items and/or data (e.g. the commissioning party or prosecuting authority) for their use and include their use in the risk assessment. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">36</a> Given the risks involved in the use of casework items/exhibits and/or data, the Senior Accountable Individual for the forensic unit shall be informed of the proposed use.</p>

<p>28.3.23 The risk assessment shall be subject to version control and should feed into the statement of validation completion.</p>

<h4>Review of the End-User’s Requirements</h4>

<p>28.3.24 The forensic unit shall review the requirements collated to ensure that requirements considered essential/mandatory have been translated correctly into the specification and the specification is fit for purpose. Where appropriate, the end-user’s specifying the requirement may be involved in this review process.</p>

<p>28.3.25 When a review identifies that there are risks, or that there are compatibility, legality, or ethical issues, the forensic unit shall produce a revised end-user’s requirements and/or specification.</p>

<p>28.3.26 Any subsequent changes to the specification shall then be only made in line with the forensic unit’s change control procedures and only following further review and acceptance of the impact of the changes by the intended end-users.</p>

<p>28.3.27 The forensic unit shall ensure that all practitioners involved in the development and validation/verification of the method are informed of any agreed changes to the end-user’s requirements or specification.</p>

<h4>The Acceptance Criteria</h4>

<p>28.3.28 The acceptance criteria shall be established in advance of the validation and should be clearly stated, based upon the specification, the risk analysis, and any control strategies put in place to control identified risks.</p>

<p>28.3.29 The acceptance criteria shall be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and control strategy within measurable and set tolerances.</p>

<h4>The Validation Plan</h4>

<p>28.3.30 The validation shall be carried out according to a documented validation plan. The validation plan shall identify and define the functional and performance requirements, the relevant parameters and characteristics to be studied, and the acceptance criteria for the results obtained to confirm that the specified requirements for the method, product, or service have been met.</p>

<p>28.3.31 Where appropriate, the validation plan shall also include a requirement to check the relevant parameters and characteristics of the procedures for sampling, handling, and transportation. The same level of confidence in the results obtained shall be required whether the method is to be used routinely or infrequently.</p>

<p>28.3.32 The validation shall be carried out using simulated casework material in the first instance and subsequently, where possible, permitted, and appropriate, with actual casework material to confirm its robustness. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:70" rel="footnote">[footnote 70]</a></sup></p>

<p>28.3.33 The validation plan should be tailored depending on whether, for example, it is intended for the:</p>

<p>a. Validation of measurement-based methods;</p>

<p>b. Validation of interpretive methods;</p>

<p>c. Verification of the validation of adopted methods; and/or</p>

<p>d. Verification of the impact of minor changes to methods.</p>

<p>28.3.34 The validation plan should be signed off by a suitably competent individual who was independent from the development of the method and has sufficient knowledge of the relevant field under study.</p>

<p>28.3.35 Where this is a plan for the validation of a new method rather than an adopted method (see 28.3.9), it is accepted additional individuals may be needed to provide the necessary breadth of technical knowledge to evaluate the plan. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:71" rel="footnote">[footnote 71]</a></sup> In such cases these individuals shall be listed in the validation report and their role in supporting the person responsible for sign-off should be recorded.</p>

<h4>Validation of Measurement-Based Methods</h4>

<p>28.3.36 The validation plan should ensure the required parameters and characteristics are studied:</p>

<p>a. By a practitioner competent in the field of work under study, who has sufficient knowledge of the work to be able to make appropriate decisions from the observations made as the study progresses; and</p>

<p>b. Using equipment that is within specification, working correctly and, where appropriate, calibrated.</p>

<p>28.3.37 The functional and performance requirements, and the relevant parameters and characteristics for measurement-based methods <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:72" rel="footnote">[footnote 72]</a></sup> that shall be considered include the following.</p>

<p>a. Competence requirements of the practitioner.</p>

<p>b. Environmental constraints.</p>

<p>c. Item/exhibit and/or sample size.</p>

<p>d. Item/exhibit and/or sample handling.</p>

<p>e. Results are consistent, reliable, accurate, robust, and with an uncertainty measurement.</p>

<p>f. Compatibility with results obtained by other practitioners using different equipment and different methods.</p>

<p>g. Limitations of applicability.</p>

<p>28.3.38 For contact trace material, the following additional functional and performance requirements, and the relevant parameters and characteristics for measurement-based methods <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:73" rel="footnote">[footnote 73]</a></sup> shall be considered include the following.</p>

<p>a. Item/exhibit and/or sample homogeneity.</p>

<p>b. Ability of the sampling process to provide a representative sample of the item/exhibit.</p>

<p>c. Efficiency of recovery of the substance(s) to be identified/measured (i.e. analyte) during sample preparation for analysis.</p>

<p>d. Presence or absence of the analyte(s) of interest in the sample analysed.</p>

<p>e. Minimum quantity of each analyte that can be reliably detected.</p>

<p>f. Minimum amount of each analyte that can be accurately quantified.</p>

<p>g. Identification/measurement relates to the analyte(s) alone, and is not compromised by the presence of some matrix or substrate effect or interfering substance.</p>

<h4>Validation of Interpretive Methods <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:74" rel="footnote">[footnote 74]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>28.3.39 The functional and performance requirements for interpretive methods are less prescriptive than for measurement-based methods although should include testing against representative ground truth data. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:75" rel="footnote">[footnote 75]</a></sup> They concentrate on the competence requirements for the practitioners involved and how the practitioners shall demonstrate that they can provide consistent, reproducible, valid, and reliable results that are compatible with the results of other competent practitioners. This may be achieved by a combination of:</p>

<p>a. Independent confirmation of results/opinions by another competent practitioner (i.e. without prior knowledge of the first result/opinion provided);</p>

<p>b. Participating in inter-laboratory comparisons (collaborative exercises or proficiency tests); and</p>

<p>c. Designing frequent in-house assessment into the process using positive and negative competence tests.</p>

<p>28.3.40 An interpretive method shall require only the relevant subset of the parameters and characteristics for measurement-based methods to be determined.</p>

<h4>Verification of the Validation of Adopted Methods</h4>

<p>28.3.41 Verification is defined as confirmation, through the assessment of existing objective evidence or through experiment, that a method, process or device is fit (or remains fit) for the specific purpose intended.</p>

<p>28.3.42 Each of the steps of the validation process are to be completed (i.e. as detailed in 28.3.7), whether the user is producing the objective evidence for relevance, reliability and completeness themselves or objectively reviewing data produced by others. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:76" rel="footnote">[footnote 76]</a></sup> The required end-user requirement and specification form the purpose that the forensic unit is assessing against. If a specification is being also adopted from elsewhere, this should be assessed for suitability for the forensic unit’s requirements also.</p>

<p>28.3.43 The assessment to identify any risks, or potential risks, to the CJS related to the use of the method or amendment to the method should be included. If the method is to be deployed in a different manner than the study that provided the data the forensic unit intended to review the specification against, the differences require to be risk-assessed and may prompt a fuller validation study.</p>

<p>28.3.44 Where the validation has not been conducted at the site <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:77" rel="footnote">[footnote 77]</a></sup> that will be using the method, the forensic unit must verify the scope of the validation with the study scaled up or down according to the adequacy and relevance of the available existing validation study.</p>

<p>28.3.45 The amount of work required to be carried out in verification exercises when introducing methods developed and validated elsewhere, shall take account of the adequacy of the available existing validation data and the familiarity and experience within the forensic unit of the techniques, equipment, and facilities involved.</p>

<p>28.3.46 The forensic unit shall check its performance against the specification for the method it is required to produce rather than simply against existing published data, as the requirements may differ.</p>

<p>28.3.47 The validation report shall have as a minimum a summary of the experimental work/review, results, specification used in the review, the risk assessment, practitioner training/competence requirement, and assessment plans. The required validation library and statement of validation completion shall be produced.</p>

<h4>Minor Changes in Methods</h4>

<p>28.3.48 Replacing like-for-like equipment <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:78" rel="footnote">[footnote 78]</a></sup> or minor changes to methods used by the forensic unit may not always require a full revalidation exercise. The impact of the change shall be risk assessed, verified against the original validation and authorised in line with other validation studies.</p>

<p>28.3.49 A revalidation exercise shall be carried out when changes are assessed to have the potential to influence the results obtained.</p>

<h4>Infrequently Used Methods</h4>

<p>28.3.50 Infrequently used methods pose a challenge in maintaining competence and capability for any FSA. While the use of such methods is acceptable there need to be appropriate safeguards.</p>

<p>28.3.51 Methods used less than once in every three-month period across a legal entity may be considered to be infrequently used. However, the forensic unit may decide not to treat a method, which falls within the definition, as an infrequently used method.</p>

<p>28.3.52 All methods used by the forensic unit, including infrequently used methods, shall have been validated in line with this Code and the forensic unit shall demonstrate competence to perform the method prior to implementation or use. The validation, verification, or re-verification shall include the steps in 28.3.7 and, as with all methods, a validation library is required. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:79" rel="footnote">[footnote 79]</a></sup></p>

<p>28.3.53 Forensic units shall have a procedure to identify infrequently performed methods and their maintenance or use including the following.</p>

<p>a. The definition of infrequently performed method;</p>

<p>b. Responsibility for confirming the validation or verification remains appropriate;</p>

<p>c. How competence will be maintained or is demonstrated, ILAC G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> recommends:</p>

<p>i. Regular use of control samples even when casework samples are not being analysed; or</p>

<p>ii. Re-verification before the examination/test in question is performed on a casework sample involving at least the use of an appropriate reference material, followed by replicate examination/testing of the real sample.</p>

<p>d. The sign-off procedure for use in casework including justification of method choice; and</p>

<p>e. How the status of the method will be described in reports.</p>

<p>28.3.54 The manner in which infrequently used methods are dealt with in relation to accreditation is considered in section 39.2.</p>

<p>28.3.55 Infrequently used methods may be maintained on the forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation through regular use of mock casework, competence assessments, and any other measures agreed with the accreditation body. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">37</a> In order to be retained within the schedule of accreditation, UKAS requires each aspect of the FSA included in the schedule of accreditation to be assessed at least once within the four-year accreditation cycle and details the requirements in its publication TPS 68 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">37</a>. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:80" rel="footnote">[footnote 80]</a></sup></p>

<p>28.3.56 If not included on the schedule of accreditation, then the methods shall be re-verified in accordance with the requirements of this Code prior to each use in casework (see 28.3.53 as well as ILAC G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a>), unless the analyte and/or item under test cannot be reproduced (e.g. a destructive chip-off procedure in digital forensics). In these rare events, the risks shall be assessed and the deviation from the Code requirement documented and disclosed in the report. If these activities are to become part of the routine activities of the forensic unit (i.e. used more frequently than once every three months), and the FSA requires it, accreditation shall be sought and obtained by the date set in the FSA definition.</p>

<h4>Validation Outcomes</h4>

<p>28.3.57 A summary of the outcome of the validation exercise shall be included in the validation report, which shall normally be retained for 30 years after the last use of the method. A full record of the validation exercise will normally be retained by the forensic unit for a similar period, but as a minimum shall be maintained for the functional life of the method and shall include:</p>

<p>a. The authorised validation plan and any subsequent changes to the plan, with justifications and authorisations for the changes;</p>

<p>b. All experimental results from the validation exercise;</p>

<p>c. A detailed comparison of the experimental results with the specified requirements;</p>

<p>d. Independent evaluation of the extent to which the results obtained conform or otherwise to the specified requirements;</p>

<p>e. Any corrective actions identified; and</p>

<p>f. Independent approval of the validation. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:81" rel="footnote">[footnote 81]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Assessment of Acceptance Criteria Compliance</h4>

<p>28.3.58 The independent evaluation of compliance of the experimental results with specified requirements shall be carried out by a person (or persons) not involved in the development of the method or conducting the validation process.</p>

<p>28.3.59 The person(s) shall have demonstrated they have sufficient knowledge of the issues involved to be able to identify and assess the significance of any deficiencies. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:82" rel="footnote">[footnote 82]</a></sup></p>

<p>28.3.60 The independent authorisation shall typically establish whether:</p>

<p>a. The validation work is adequate and has fully demonstrated compliance of the method with the acceptance criteria for the agreed specification; and</p>

<p>b. The method is fit for its intended use.</p>

<p>28.3.61 If the forensic unit were to plan to implement methods rated as high risk and/or likely to attract challenge once implemented, the Regulator should be consulted as to the need for any wider review and/or publication prior to implementation.</p>

<h4>Validation Report <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:83" rel="footnote">[footnote 83]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>28.3.62 The forensic unit shall produce a validation report in sufficient detail to allow independent assessment of the adequacy of the work carried out in demonstrating that the method, product, or service conforms to the specification and is fit for purpose. The report need not contain all the experimental data, but a summary of this data shall be provided, and the raw data shall be available for inspection if required.</p>

<p>28.3.63 The content of the validation report shall depend on the type and extent of validation carried out, but as a general guide it should include, as appropriate:</p>

<p>a. A title and unique identifier;</p>

<p>b. A description of the purpose of the method, product, or service;</p>

<p>c. The specification;</p>

<p>d. The name, version number, and manufacturer of any equipment used;</p>

<p>e. The name(s) and signature(s) of the person(s) accountable for the development of the validation processes;</p>

<p>f. The validation plan;</p>

<p>g. The risk assessment;</p>

<p>h. Any authorised changes to the validation plan and justifications for the changes;</p>

<p>i. A summary of the experimental work and outcomes in sufficient detail to ensure that the tests could be independently replicated by a competent person;</p>

<p>j. Details of any review reports produced;</p>

<p>k. Conformity with the acceptance criteria (expected compared with actual results and any pass/fail criteria);</p>

<p>l. Any limitations/constraints applicable;</p>

<p>m. Any related published papers and similar methods in use by the forensic unit;</p>

<p>n. Any recommendations relating to the implementation of the method, product or service; and</p>

<p>o. The date of the report.</p>

<p>28.3.64 The forensic unit shall submit the validation report for review by persons suitably qualified and independent of the validation process; any issues arising should be dealt with expeditiously.</p>

<p>28.3.65 All the required records relating to the development and validation of the method, product, or service shall be archived, together with the means of accessing the records, and will normally be kept for 30 years following the method’s last use in casework. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:84" rel="footnote">[footnote 84]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Statement of Validation Completion</h4>

<p>28.3.66 The forensic unit shall prepare a ‘statement of validation completion’ on the successful completion of a validation exercise. The aim of the statement of validation completion is to provide a short executive summary of the validation steps performed, and key issues identified in the validation including strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. The intention is that the statement will be no more than two sides of A4 paper in plain language. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:85" rel="footnote">[footnote 85]</a></sup></p>

<p>28.3.67 The approval by the forensic unit on the scope of the validation must be clear.</p>

<p>28.3.68 The forensic unit should provide any further information that would be useful to the CJS. Examples would include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. Caveats about the use of the method;</p>

<p>b. The approved uses of the method, which could be by case type or item/exhibit type;</p>

<p>c. Circumstances in which the use of the method would be inadvisable; and</p>

<p>d. Additional work that should be undertaken in combination with the result.</p>

<h4>Validation Library</h4>

<p>28.3.69 The forensic unit shall have available a library of documents relevant to the authorisation of the new method through validation or verification. Where the following are not already distinct sections in the validation report, the content of this library shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

<p>a. The specification for the method approved (see Determining the Specification);</p>

<p>b. Any associated supporting material, such as academic papers or technical reports that were used to support or provide evidence on the applicability of the method; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:86" rel="footnote">[footnote 86]</a></sup></p>

<p>c. The risk assessment for the method approved;</p>

<p>d. The validation plan for the method approved;</p>

<p>e. The validation report;</p>

<p>f. The record of approval; and</p>

<p>g. The statement of validation completion.</p>

<p>28.3.70 Where the method implements a scientific theory/model or an interpretation or evaluation model, the library should include a record of information supporting the use of the theory/model.</p>

<p>28.3.71 Where the method relies on reference collections or databases, the nature, access, and their availability should be described.</p>

<p>28.3.72 The information in the library may be disclosable in criminal proceedings <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:87" rel="footnote">[footnote 87]</a></sup> and should be prepared with that possibility in mind.</p>

<h4>Implementation Plan and Any Constraints</h4>

<p>28.3.73 The forensic unit shall have a plan for implementation of methods, products, or services new to the forensic unit. This plan shall address, where relevant:</p>

<p>a. If the revised or new method has the potential to offer new analytical opportunities relevant to revisiting old cases, how will this new capability be communicated to previous commissioning parties to ensure benefits and risks are clearly available for them to evaluate if any action is warranted;</p>

<p>b. The standard operating procedure (including the process for assessment/interpretation/reporting of results) or instructions for use;</p>

<p>c. Requirements for staff training, competence assessment, and on-going monitoring of staff competence;</p>

<p>d. Integration of the method with what is already in place;</p>

<p>e. If the method is intended to be included in the scope of accreditation and what steps are required to achieve this;</p>

<p>f. The monitoring mechanisms to be used to demonstrate that the method remains under satisfactory control during its use;</p>

<p>g. The protocols for calibration, monitoring, and maintenance of any equipment;</p>

<p>h. The supply and traceability of any standards/reference materials;</p>

<p>i. The supply and quality control of key materials, consumables, and reagents;</p>

<p>j. The item/exhibit handling and any anti-contamination protocols;</p>

<p>k. The accommodation plan;</p>

<p>l. Any specific health and safety, environmental protection, data protection, and information security arrangements;</p>

<p>m. The communication plan; and</p>

<p>n. The schedule for post-implementation review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">29. </span> Estimation of Uncertainty</h2>

<p>29.1.1 A forensic unit performing testing <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:88" rel="footnote">[footnote 88]</a></sup> is required to evaluate measurement uncertainty; testing is the determination of one or more characteristics according to a procedure and although typically quantitative, it can be qualitative (e.g. a presumptive test with a colour change).</p>

<p>29.1.2 Qualitative testing may be for the presence or absence of a defined analyte but there will be uncertainty associated with the underlying test conditions. Where the test method precludes rigorous evaluation of measurement such as a test that is qualitative in nature, UKAS M3003 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">38</a> states “there will be uncertainties associated with the underlying test conditions and these should be subject to the same type of evaluation as is required for quantitative test results”. ILAC G17 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">39</a> indicates that with qualitative testing or examinations, an estimation of the probability for false positive or false negative test results may be relevant. A method of evaluating contributions to uncertainty may include the method used for risk assessment during the validation of the method (see 28.3.19).</p>

<p>29.1.3 The impact that uncertainty may have on the findings shall be included in both factual and evaluative reports to the CJS where it is relevant.</p>

<p>29.1.4 When a procedure is modified, in addition to any validation or verification, forensic units should also review the measurement uncertainty.</p>

<p>29.1.5 Guidance on the estimation of uncertainty of measurement is contained in Appendix N of the UKAS M3003 publication ‘The Expression of Uncertainty and Confidence in Measurement’. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">38</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:89" rel="footnote">[footnote 89]</a></sup></p>

<p>29.1.6 The Criminal Practice Directions V (19A.5c) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a> which supplements Part 19 of the Criminal Procedure Rules <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a> include several factors which should be considered. However, the following direction that the court may take into account in determining admissibility is particularly relevant:</p>

<p>19A.5c “if the expert’s opinion relies on the results of the use of any method (for instance, a test, measurement or survey), whether the opinion takes proper account of matters, such as the degree of precision or margin of uncertainty, affecting the accuracy or reliability of those results.”</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">30. </span> Control of Data</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">30.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>30.1.1 The forensic unit shall have procedures within its management system to ensure that all necessary information is recorded accurately, maintained so that its authenticity and integrity is not compromised, and is retained and destroyed in accordance with the forensic unit’s retention and destruction policy (see 38 - Retention, Recording, Revelation and Disclosure). <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">22</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">40</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">41</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">42</a> This applies within all environments the FSA is performed or output stored, including remote sites such as authorised home-based working environments where FSAs are conducted.</p>

<p>30.1.2 The forensic unit shall perform a risk assessment that should include process mapping and identify critical control stages in the process requiring specific protection steps to prevent loss, corruption, and unauthorised access. This risk assessment may occur during method development, method validation and combined with risk assessments looking at risk of contamination <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:90" rel="footnote">[footnote 90]</a></sup>, or may be standalone looking at data. The steps included in the risk assessment shall include the following.</p>

<p>a. Identify critical data.</p>

<p>b. Identify critical control points (i.e. places where data is entered, transferred, stored, or processed).</p>

<p>c. Identify hazards to be controlled at the critical control points (e.g. data corruption, errors, media loss, unauthorised access, unauthorised manipulation, or the practitioner having sight of data extraneous to the stage of the activity, i.e. if there is a risk of cognitive bias in the FSA). <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:91" rel="footnote">[footnote 91]</a></sup></p>

<p>d. Consider all items being tested/exhibits related to the FSA carrying data, or if wider risk assessment is being performed, all items being tested/exhibits.</p>

<p>e. Include technology operated by the forensic unit such as mobile phones, satellite navigation systems, laptops, cameras etc. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:92" rel="footnote">[footnote 92]</a></sup></p>

<p>30.1.3 The forensic unit shall identify mitigation steps based on the risk assessment to:</p>

<p>a. Minimise the risk of data loss;</p>

<p>b. Minimise the risk of data corruption (deliberate, degraded, actual, or suspected);</p>

<p>c. Control extraneous information;</p>

<p>d. Demonstrate that the results are reliable and analytically sound; and</p>

<p>e. Maintain continuity and prevent unauthorised access to and/or amendment of all electronic records identified by assessment of the critical control points of key data.</p>

<p>30.1.4 In case of nationally provided and managed services (e.g. the Police National Computer) that are outside the control of the forensic unit, the forensic unit shall consider, and document, the risk to the forensic unit and any mitigation introduced to control that risk.</p>

<p>30.1.5 Protection steps shall be tested by sampling of key data. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:93" rel="footnote">[footnote 93]</a></sup></p>

<p>30.1.6 Whilst these clauses indicate the forensic units, where the forensic unit is within a larger organisation, achieving or demonstrating compliance may require some liaison with the organisation’s Information Security/IT departments. The Senior Accountable Individual (SAI) is responsible for ensuring compliance with this Code and should be senior enough to ensure support services in larger organisations outside the forensic unit assist compliance and/or demonstration of compliance if required (see 16.2).</p>

<p>30.1.7 The following sections focus on information held in an electronic form. More general requirements that also apply for physical items/exhibits are set out in this Code in sections 20 – Document Control, 24 – Control of Records, 27 – Environment where the FSA is Undertaken, and in section 34 – Handling of Items/Exhibits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">30.2 </span> Electronic Information Capture, Storage, Transfer, Retrieval and Disposal <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:94" rel="footnote">[footnote 94]</a></sup>
</h3>

<p>30.2.1 The forensic unit shall establish procedures for the capture and retrieval of electronic information appropriate for the process or method. If the capture or transformation process does involve any loss or change, this should have been assessed during validation and the acceptance criteria stated (e.g. as defined in the method’s end-user requirements, specification, or in the procedure itself).</p>

<p>30.2.2 Where scanning technology is used, the forensic unit shall establish procedures and quality control for the scanning of documents in paper form, microforms, and other forms of information, as appropriate, to ensure that any potential information loss as a result of the scanning is within acceptable limits. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:95" rel="footnote">[footnote 95]</a></sup></p>

<p>30.2.3 Appropriate to the associated FSA, the procedure and policies should ensure that where key information is extracted from pictorial image files the original images are retained and linked with the captured data, including digital metadata.</p>

<p>30.2.4 Where an electronic document has, for example embedded files or hyperlinks, all relevant parts of the document shall be stored in line with the forensic unit’s retention policy along with their content.</p>

<p>30.2.5 Critical data should be accessible throughout its period of retention.</p>

<p>30.2.6 When data is migrated from storage media owned or controlled by the forensic unit (i.e. not the submitted item/exhibit) to alternative storage media, the forensic unit shall establish procedures to ensure that all digital objects <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:96" rel="footnote">[footnote 96]</a></sup> have been successfully migrated. The digital object and file format of the migrated digital objects should not have changed, or that the changes are known, have been audited, and meet requirements.</p>

<p>30.2.7 If replacement software (e.g. an operating system or application software) is implemented, the forensic unit shall ensure that procedures are established to retain access to any critical data reliant on that software.</p>

<p>30.2.8 Any compression applied to the archival storage of data/information should be fit for purpose; for evidential data this may mean it should be assessed if compression should be mathematically lossless so as not to put into question its data integrity or authenticity.</p>

<p>30.2.9 Data shall be retained according to retention and destruction policy until such time as that policy determines it should be destroyed (see also 38 - Retention, Recording, Revelation and Disclosure). Destruction or disposal of the data, including the method by which that is achieved should be recorded within the audit trail for that data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">30.3 </span> Electronic Information Security <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">43</a>
</h3>

<p>30.3.1 The forensic unit shall have an information security policy which explains how the unit meets its responsibilities outlined in section 30.1. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">44</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">45</a> The information security policy shall describe the procedures, based on business and security requirements, as assessed by the forensic unit, for the management of its electronic information. The forensic unit shall ensure procedures are subject to regular testing, audit and review. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:97" rel="footnote">[footnote 97]</a></sup></p>

<p>30.3.2 The forensic unit’s information security policy shall have processes for the following parts of this section.</p>

<h4>Access Control to Electronic Information</h4>

<p>30.3.3 The access control procedures shall include the identification, authentication, and authorisation of users. Users shall have defined privileges which limit, as far as practical, access to only the information and key operational services they require to perform their roles.</p>

<p>30.3.4 When users leave their role or the organisation, the forensic unit shall ensure access is removed.</p>

<p>30.3.5 Reviews should take place at least every 6 months to determine whether access rights are still needed - if access rights are no longer needed, they shall be removed.</p>

<p>30.3.6 Users with administrative rights shall use multi-factor authentication <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:98" rel="footnote">[footnote 98]</a></sup> where this is technically possible.</p>

<p>30.3.7 Accounts with administrative rights shall only be used to perform defined administrative duties <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:99" rel="footnote">[footnote 99]</a></sup>, and not be used for routine access to e-mail or the Internet. The administrative duty may include periodic access to emails/or internet to download software patches or perform a software update however, the risks of this open access should be controlled.</p>

<p>30.3.8 Where network access is under the control of the forensic unit (e.g. not a nationally delivered system), authentication failures should be throttled to 10 attempts in 5 minutes and locked out where this is practicable.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:100" rel="footnote">[footnote 100]</a></sup> Access control mechanisms shall be protected to prevent unauthorised system-wide access. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">46</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">47</a></p>

<h4>The Selection, Use and Management of Passwords</h4>

<p>30.3.9 The forensic unit shall have procedures for the selection, use, and management of passwords which should be formulated to help users to generate better passwords. The procedures shall include the following.</p>

<p>a. Passwords should be of an appropriate level of complexity. Consideration may be given to using:</p>

<p>i. the ‘three random words’ <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">48</a> technique for generating suitably complex and memorable passphrases; or</p>

<p>ii. machine generated passwords with appropriate facilities to store them such as password managers. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">49</a></p>

<p>b. Passwords shall be a minimum of 8 characters and should have no maximum length. Regular password expiry should not be enforced, but users shall change their password when it is known (or suspected) that it has been compromised.</p>

<p>c. Users should be directed to use different passwords for their:</p>

<p>i. personal and any work accounts; and</p>

<p>ii. general work account and any work accounts they may have with administrative rights.</p>

<p>d. Users should, where technically possible, be prevented from reusing passwords.</p>

<p>e. Users should, where technically possible, be directed to not select easily guessed or commonly used passwords <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">50</a> and should be prevented from doing so.</p>

<p>f. The system should be designed to protect the password in transit and at rest using appropriate encryption and hashing techniques. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">47</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">51</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">52</a></p>

<p>g. All default administrative passwords for applications, network equipment, and computers shall be changed <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">47</a> to meet the requirements identified in this section.</p>

<h4>Protection Against Malware</h4>

<p>30.3.10 The provisions of this section (comprised of 30.3.11 - 30.3.20) do not apply to evidence handling activities where the use of anti-malware processes have the potential to adversely affect the work. In activities where anti-malware processes are not employed the forensic unit should implement suitable safeguards against the effect of malware.</p>

<p>30.3.11 Subject to the provisions of section 30.3.10, the forensic unit shall have procedures for the detection, removal and/or treatment of malware. These procedures may be based on system design and one, or more, software packages. The procedures should ensure the detection, quarantine, removal and/or impact mitigation of malware. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:101" rel="footnote">[footnote 101]</a></sup></p>

<p>30.3.12 Software which is part of the anti-malware system shall be updated when new definitions become available. Anti-malware updates should be included in the forensic unit’s change procedures to manage any potential impact to the forensic science activity.</p>

<p>30.3.13 Anti-malware system shall cover all compatible computers and hardware, unless specified operational requirements dictate otherwise. The forensic unit should implement additional anti-malware procedures such as application/executable allow listing. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">53</a></p>

<p>30.3.14 For all devices that access the internet, the forensic unit shall have (or ensure that its IT provider has) procedures in place to protect from website and email-borne malware caused by drive-by download and phishing attacks.</p>

<p>30.3.15 The forensic unit shall access the Internet via a proxy service which blocks malware. The forensic unit shall have procedures for filtering or blocking phishing emails or messages, before they reach users.</p>

<p>30.3.16 For all devices that access the internet, the forensic unit shall have procedures <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:102" rel="footnote">[footnote 102]</a></sup> to update (patch) malware software and firmware in a timely manner and included in the forensic unit’s change procedures to manage any potential impact to the forensic examination process. ‘Critical’ and ‘High’ severity patches (as defined by the organisation issuing the patches) for Internet-enabled systems shall be installed promptly. Where this is not possible, then other mitigations (such as physical or logical separation) shall be applied.</p>

<p>30.3.17 Software and firmware that is no longer supported by vendors, should be replaced unless there is a technical or CJS justification for its continued use recorded in the procedure. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:103" rel="footnote">[footnote 103]</a></sup></p>

<p>30.3.18 All removable storage media, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:104" rel="footnote">[footnote 104]</a></sup> including that believed to be new, shall be scanned using the anti-malware system before use/issue.</p>

<p>30.3.19 The forensic unit should securely configure computers by following the End User Device security principles. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">53</a></p>

<p>30.3.20 The forensic unit shall have access to backup data to assist recovery from malware. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">54</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">55</a></p>

<h4>Management of Removable Storage Media <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:105" rel="footnote">[footnote 105]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>30.3.21 Procedures for management of removable storage media used by the forensic unit to transfer data (e.g. memory cards, USB drives, optical media) shall include controls related to issue and their use. These procedures shall include wiping/re-formatting of the storage media appropriate to the FSA the media is used in (i.e. typically using a defined secure or forensic method).</p>

<p>30.3.22 Removable storage media shall only be issued to users whose role requires it. Only the minimum interfaces necessary for the use of removable storage media should be enabled on computers and those users to whom those computers are issued should be made aware of the permitted interfaces.</p>

<p>30.3.23 Personal removable storage media shall not be used for the transfer of electronic data - only officially issued removeable storage media shall be used which:</p>

<p>a. Shall be physically secured when not in use;</p>

<p>b. Should not be used to take data offsite unless its contents are secured using appropriate encryption techniques <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">56</a>; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:106" rel="footnote">[footnote 106]</a></sup> and</p>

<p>c. Should be subject to accountability with the aim of tracking use and managing loss. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">46</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">57</a></p>

<h4>The Segregation of Forensic Networks</h4>

<p>30.3.24 The forensic unit shall have procedures for the segregation of networks used for forensic science activities from other networks. Networks that do not need to communicate or interact with each other should be separated into different network segments, and only allow users to access a segment where needed. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:107" rel="footnote">[footnote 107]</a></sup> Segregation can be achieved physically or ‘logically’. Logical separation can include access control lists, network and computer virtualisation, firewalling, and network encryption such as Internet Protocol Security (IPSec). <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">58</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">59</a></p>

<h4>Backups, Recovery and Business Continuity</h4>

<p>30.3.25 The forensic unit shall have procedures for business continuity with an incident management plan including backup and retrieval of data, to recover from incidents such as malware (see 30.3.20), theft, fire, or hardware failure, whilst ensuring the business can continue to function.</p>

<p>30.3.26 The forensic unit shall identify what electronic data is essential to keeping operations running and make regular backup copies, or where that infrastructure is provided by the larger organisation (e.g. police force) seek assurance the backup is adequate.</p>

<p>30.3.27 The forensic unit shall identify its critical systems and have redundancy arrangements in place. The forensic unit shall test that backups are working to ensure it can restore the electronic information from them in the event of an incident. Offline backups shall be created and stored for as long as necessary to meet the requirements of the CJS.</p>

<p>30.3.28 Where digital data is the evidence, the procedure should be risk-based, balancing consideration of the time between creation of the extracted material, retention of the evidential device, and any identified off-site back-up requirement (see also 30.1.2 and 38 - Retention, Recording, Revelation and Disclosure).</p>

<p>30.3.29 Offline backups should be stored at a separate and secure location. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:108" rel="footnote">[footnote 108]</a></sup> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">60</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">54</a> The forensic unit may use appropriate cloud services for this back-up of electronic information; ‘offline’ here means digitally disconnected or fully protected from any malware risk when not in use and/or designed and tested to remain unaffected should any incident impact the live environment through robust protection from malware. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">61</a></p>

<p>30.3.30 The forensic unit shall have an incident management plan <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:109" rel="footnote">[footnote 109]</a></sup> which helps staff identify, respond to, and recover from, incidents as well as continue to run the business. The incident management plan should include a communication strategy (which includes appropriate escalation levels to the SAI, the Regulator and, if accredited, its accreditation body), roles and responsibilities of staff and third parties such as service providers and authorities, as well as contact details for those involved.</p>

<p>30.3.31 The forensic unit shall test its business continuity procedure at least once in a four-year cycle (see 17.1.4). The incident management plan shall also be tested, whether it is part of the overall procedure or separate, to ensure that its electronic information and critical systems can be recovered in the event of an incident.</p>

<p>30.3.32 Revisions to the incident management plan should include lessons learnt to minimise the risk of disruption to the business occurring in the same way again. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">46</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">57</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">61</a></p>

<h4>Network Security and Mobile Working<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:110" rel="footnote">[footnote 110]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>30.3.33 The network security and mobile working procedures shall include the management of the network perimeter <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:111" rel="footnote">[footnote 111]</a></sup> by using firewalls to create a ‘buffer zone’ between the Internet (and other untrusted networks) and the networks used by the business.</p>

<p>30.3.34 The forensic unit shall have procedures to protect its internal networks by ensuring there is no direct routing between internal and external networks (especially the Internet). The forensic unit shall have procedures for securing wireless access to its networks. All wireless access points shall be secured using Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) or WPA3, and only allow known devices to connect to corporate Wi-Fi services.</p>

<p>30.3.35 Where mobile working is required, the forensic unit shall have procedures for ensuring that connections are identified, authenticated <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:112" rel="footnote">[footnote 112]</a></sup> and authorised. All electronic information which transits the Internet (and other untrusted networks) shall be protected from eavesdropping and alteration using appropriate encryption such as IPSec and Transport Layer Security (TLS). <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">62</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">51</a></p>

<p>30.3.36 All mobile devices shall only have the necessary applications and electronic information to fulfil the business activity that is being delivered outside the normal office environment. If the mobile device supports it, data shall be encrypted at rest. The forensic unit should ensure there are adequate procedures for monitoring network traffic for unusual incoming and outgoing activity that could be indicative of an attack. The forensic unit shall have procedures for testing the security of its networks. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">46</a></p>

<h4>The Use of Cloud-Based Services</h4>

<p>30.3.37 The process for the use of cloud-based services shall include procedures to:</p>

<p>a. Determine the business need and end-user requirements;</p>

<p>b. Determine and document the boundary of the cloud and the network perimeter (i.e. is this an internal/private cloud); <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:113" rel="footnote">[footnote 113]</a></sup></p>

<p>c. Identify what data will be transported, stored and processed, and document the associated risks;</p>

<p>d. Evaluate the security of the service offered; and</p>

<p>e. Understand the residual risks and how these will be managed.</p>

<p>30.3.38 The forensic unit should use cloud providers which meet the National Cyber Security Centre’s cloud security principles. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">63</a> The forensic unit should include within the contract with the cloud-based provider that storage and processing of evidential data using cloud-based services should only be performed from data centres physically located in the UK. The forensic unit should periodically review whether the cloud-based services still meet its business and security needs.</p>

<h4>Security Monitoring and Situational Awareness</h4>

<p>30.3.39 The forensic unit’s security monitoring and situational awareness procedures shall include the generation, capture, retention, storage, and analysis of records from its computers and network equipment. The forensic unit’s security monitoring procedures shall achieve the following.</p>

<p>a. Provide visibility of communication between their network and other networks (i.e. the Internet or 3rd party suppliers).</p>

<p>b. Capture authentication and access attempts.</p>

<p>c. Provide asset and configuration information. All records shall be stored securely so they are safe from tampering and unauthorised access. All records should be stored for a minimum of 6 months so that they can be used to support incident management. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">64</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">65</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">31. </span> Reference Collections and Databases</h2>

<p>31.1.1 Forensic units shall maintain a list of all reference collections and databases (this includes, but is not limited to, those internally developed, commercially developed, or remotely accessed) used to:</p>

<p>a. make inferences and interpretation.</p>

<p>b. support the validation of search algorithms, training, and proficiency testing in house (i.e. Ground Truth Databases).</p>

<p>c. support the investigation or control of contamination (e.g. staff elimination databases and/or contamination elimination databases).</p>

<p>31.1.2 Forensic units shall have a process for determining the requirements of the CJS for internally developed reference collections and databases used to make inferences and interpretations or for supporting validation.</p>

<p>31.1.3 Information included in all reference collections and databases used to make inferences and interpretations should be capable of authentication through documentation to its original source, meet a minimum quality standard specified by the owner of the collection or database, be verified for accuracy of transcription on entry to the database, and be auditable for corruption.</p>

<p>31.1.4 Any programs or script for data manipulation employed within databases to make inferences and interpretations shall be validated, either separately or as part of the process or method they are used in as laid out in this Code, e.g. with reference to the impact of any uncertainty of measurement and the risk of false positives/negatives.</p>

<p>31.1.5 All reference collections and databases used to make inferences and interpretations shall be covered by documentation specifying, as a minimum:</p>

<p>a. Their purpose;</p>

<p>b. Their location and identification;</p>

<p>c. Their scope and content;</p>

<p>d. The origin of the data;</p>

<p>e. Any known significant limitations or restrictions;</p>

<p>f. The person responsible for management of the database;</p>

<p>g. The authorisation and competence requirements of organisations/practitioners contributing to the database;</p>

<p>r. All relevant legal, commercial, and ethical requirements covering their registration, data content, retention, accessibility, or use.</p>

<p>31.1.6 Forensic units should collate the above information on existing as well as new reference collections and databases (used to make inferences and interpretations) and assess if any persisting gaps will affect critical findings and/or admissibility.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">32. </span> Equipment</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">32.1 </span> Computers and Related Automated Equipment</h3>

<p>32.1.1 The forensic unit shall ensure that any software used on computers or automated equipment is assessed for its impact on results and is documented in sufficient detail based on that assessment. This includes any software developed, configured, or modified by the forensic unit, or by other outside agencies working on the forensic unit’s equipment.</p>

<p>32.1.2 Commercial off-the-shelf software and software tools whose operation has an impact in obtaining results will require validation, or any existing validation to be verified, as laid out in section 28.3 - Validation of Methods.</p>

<p>32.1.3 The forensic units’ procedures shall include what testing or verification is required prior to computers and/or related equipment being returned to service e.g. when returning from calibration/maintenance or following a move.</p>

<p>32.1.4 Other commercial off-the-shelf software (e.g. Microsoft ® Word and Excel) that does not directly contribute to results obtained shall be considered suitably validated for general use. However, calculations embedded in spreadsheets that do not form part of a validated electronic process shall be included in the required systematic checks.</p>

<p>32.1.5 The forensic unit shall maintain records of software products installed on computer systems critical to the production of analytical results, and shall ensure configuration control so that only specified versions of software, settings, and firmware, if applicable, are used. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:114" rel="footnote">[footnote 114]</a></sup> The forensic unit shall have documented procedures for configuration management to ensure that all changes to software/hardware are controlled, and that all individual software installations are known and are periodically checked that the correct version is installed and no unauthorised modifications have occurred, e.g. by service engineers.</p>

<p>32.1.6 The forensic unit shall have a policy for all items/exhibits of equipment containing sensitive data to ensure the data:</p>

<p>a. Are secure during any maintenance visit;</p>

<p>b. Remain secure while off-site (e.g. for servicing); or</p>

<p>c. Have been removed or securely overwritten prior to removal from site or disposal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">33. </span> Measurement Traceability - Intermediate Checks</h2>

<p>33.1.1 Reference standards/materials and reagents shall not be used beyond the expiry date, where provided, unless it is verified that they remain fit for purpose beyond that date.</p>

<p>33.1.2 If photographic equipment is used for evidential purposes, then there should be traceable records related to the calibration/suitability of the equipment used.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">34. </span> Handling of Items/Exhibits</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>34.1.1 Any actions prior to the forensic staff attending the scene of incident or the forensic staff taking control of items/exhibits are outside of the control of the forensic staff. The forensic staff shall have processes to capture any observations about the scene or received items/exhibits that might have an impact on the examination or subsequent analysis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.2 </span> Items/Exhibits at the Scene of Incident</h3>

<p>34.2.1 Before items/exhibits are recovered from the scene of incident, the practitioner shall consider the on-site conditions to ensure that the items/exhibits can be recovered and documented in line with the forensic strategy.</p>

<p>34.2.2 If doubts remain about whether the items/exhibits can be properly recovered in the prevailing circumstances, the commissioning party should be consulted (before proceeding) about whether and how the available resources should be used. For example, are additional ‘specialist’ examiners or technical resources required to conduct the examination or testing in situ.</p>

<p>34.2.3 The forensic unit shall ensure that its scene examiners are provided with and implement the relevant procedures to minimise the risk of cross-contamination between different scenes, items/exhibits, suspects, witnesses, and victims (see 27.2). <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">31</a></p>

<p>34.2.4 The forensic unit shall have documented procedures to ensure that items/exhibits recovered from the scene are appropriately<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:115" rel="footnote">[footnote 115]</a></sup>:</p>

<p>a. Labelled;</p>

<p>b. Protected/packaged;</p>

<p>c. Preserved;</p>

<p>d. Listed on a schedule of recovered items;</p>

<p>e. Transported;</p>

<p>f. Stored;</p>

<p>g. Transferred for analysis/examination; and</p>

<p>h. Retained, returned or disposed of in compliance with documented procedures.</p>

<p>34.2.5 The forensic unit shall ensure that anti-contamination measures appropriate to the FSA, the analyte of interest, and the risk of contamination are employed for any vehicles and equipment used for scene examination purposes or the transport of items/exhibits and personnel.</p>

<p>34.2.6 Where a large quantity of potentially evidential material is available and sufficient representative sample needs to be taken for analysis/examination, including for presumptive testing, the practitioner should consider this in the sampling strategy.</p>

<p>34.2.7 The forensic unit shall protect the items/exhibits during processing and delivery to the intended destination, through handling, packaging, storage, and protection, and ensure that practitioners who may subsequently examine or analyse the items/exhibits are aware of anything that may have potentially compromised the items/exhibits integrity.</p>

<p>34.2.8 The forensic unit shall ensure that recovered items/exhibits are clearly and uniquely identified within the organisation rather than simply within the case. A combination of practitioner initials and identity number, plus date is not considered sufficiently discriminating. Although adoption of such a system would not devalue or invalidate the item if properly handled, it adds a risk which should be avoided.</p>

<p>34.2.9 Where applicable, the identity and location of the item/exhibit within the scene shall be documented or characterised as appropriate for example using plans, measurements, diagrams, photography and/or photogrammetry.</p>

<p>34.2.10 For this purpose, a ‘chain of custody’ record shall be maintained detailing the location of the item/exhibit at all times, from acquisition of items/exhibits which details each person who takes possession of the item/exhibit and when, or the location of the item/exhibit (e.g. if in storage). The chain of custody record shall include details of when the items/exhibits are destroyed or the circumstances under which they are released and to whom.</p>

<p>34.2.11 The forensic unit shall also ensure that the identification details provided with each item/exhibit, on the item/exhibit label, and accompanying submission form, remain with the item/exhibit throughout its life, so as to ensure that, using a combination of the case number and/exhibit identification, no items/exhibits can be confused physically or when referred to in records or other documents.</p>

<p>34.2.12 All items/exhibits and associated documentation generated during scene examination shall be independently checked to ensure compliance with the requirements for acceptance set by the forensic unit. This should be at the appropriate stage to control the risk, typically prior to storage or submission for further examination/analysis to another forensic unit or section of the forensic unit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.3 </span> Receipt of Cases and Items/Exhibits at the Forensic Unit</h3>

<p>34.3.1 The forensic unit shall have procedures for the transportation, receipt <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:116" rel="footnote">[footnote 116]</a></sup>, handling, protection, storage, retention, and/or disposal of items/exhibits.</p>

<p>34.3.2 These shall include a documented case acceptance policy which should include risk-based rejection procedure <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:117" rel="footnote">[footnote 117]</a></sup> for the handling of an item/exhibit for examination arising from, but not limited to:</p>

<p>a. Not being able to legally hold the material (e.g. not possessing necessary licences);</p>

<p>b. Having health and safety concerns about the submission or the ability to handle the material safely;</p>

<p>c. Not having the appropriate quality standards to do the examination requested;</p>

<p>d. A missing item/exhibit label;</p>

<p>e. A low level of agreement between the details on an item/exhibit label and those on the accompanying submission documentation;</p>

<p>f. Inconsistency between the details on an item/exhibit label and/or accompanying submission documentation and what the item/exhibit actually is;</p>

<p>g. Illegibility in any information on an item/exhibit label;</p>

<p>h. There being conflicting information on the label(s) on an item/exhibit;</p>

<p>i. Appropriate control samples not being submitted;</p>

<p>j. Repeat of the same identification details on different item/exhibit labels;</p>

<p>k. Inadequate, improper, or untimely packaging or sealing of an item/exhibit that could prejudice its integrity;</p>

<p>l. Previous handling, storage, or evidence of tampering with an item/exhibit that could prejudice its integrity; and</p>

<p>m. Insufficient material being available for meaningful examination or analysis.</p>

<p>34.3.3 If the forensic unit is unable to accept the submission the reasons for rejection shall be recorded.</p>

<p>34.3.4 The process for reception of items should include identification of items which should be subject to additional safety and/or security provisions.</p>

<p>34.3.5 Any evidence of improper tampering with an item/exhibit or suggesting such tampering may have occurred or been attempted, shall be investigated (see 23.1.3). If the outcome of the investigation indicates a deliberate attempt has been made to affect the results of the examination, the SAI shall be informed to decide the appropriate escalation (which may include involvement of the police), which shall include notifying the Regulator.</p>

<p>34.3.6 The case acceptance procedure shall also specifically address the handling and receipt or rejection of potentially hazardous items/exhibits that might pose a risk to the health or safety of staff <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:118" rel="footnote">[footnote 118]</a></sup>, potentially compromise other work carried out at the forensic unit’s facility <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:119" rel="footnote">[footnote 119]</a></sup>, or which may not be lawfully retained or handled if accepted by the forensic unit <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:120" rel="footnote">[footnote 120]</a></sup> .</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.4 </span> Item/Exhibit Handling, Protection and Storage</h3>

<p>34.4.1 The forensic unit shall ensure that item/exhibit handling policies and procedures address continuity requirements including, but not limited to that:</p>

<p>a. The item/exhibit can, at all times when in the possession or control of the forensic unit, be uniquely identified so can be conclusively shown to be the item/exhibit submitted to the forensic unit;</p>

<p>b. Any specific measures that might apply due to the type of item should be identified i.e. alleged controlled substance, alleged firearm;</p>

<p>c. Any material recovered from or derived from an item/exhibit or sub-sample of an item/exhibit can be conclusively linked to the item/exhibit or sub-sample from which it came;</p>

<p>d. Any result can be conclusively linked back to the item/exhibit from which it came, or the key equipment used to create the result;</p>

<p>e. The forensic unit can show whether the item/exhibit was retained, returned to the organisation that submitted it, or destroyed;</p>

<p>f. The measures to secure items/exhibits and/or derived material to ensure that they cannot be tampered with or otherwise compromised without detection:</p>

<p>g. Only personnel authorised by management shall have access to the retained materials; and</p>

<p>h. Movement of material in and out of the facility shall be properly recorded (see 27.1 - Examination Facilities).</p>

<p>34.4.2 The forensic unit shall, as far as possible, store the item/exhibit in a manner which prevents deterioration. This shall include any temporary storage, such as in a vehicle at an incident scene, whilst awaiting transfer to a facility. Temporary storage facilities should also be assessed to ensure that the integrity and security of the item is not compromised.</p>

<p>34.4.3 The forensic unit shall, as far as possible, preserve the item/exhibit, or part of the item/exhibit, in its original form to allow for independent re-examination or testing. If an insufficient quantity of the item/exhibit remains for independent re-examination or testing, or the form of the item/exhibit is altered, the forensic unit shall ensure that details of the item/exhibit in its original form are recorded in sufficient detail for an independent examiner to be able to check that correct procedures and techniques have been used and that the results obtained appear valid.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34.5 </span> Item/Exhibit Return and Disposal</h3>

<p>34.5.1 The forensic unit shall have an agreement with its commissioning party for the return or disposal of items/exhibits once the examination has been completed. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:121" rel="footnote">[footnote 121]</a></sup></p>

<p>34.5.2 Forensic units may deal with material that is subject to legal control or prohibition on possession, production, or use. Policies covering such items/exhibits should reflect any legal control or prohibition covering retention, the return to the organisation that submitted the item/exhibits, or destruction. Examples of such items/exhibits include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>a. Human tissue; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:122" rel="footnote">[footnote 122]</a></sup></p>

<p>b. Drugs;</p>

<p>c. Firearms; and</p>

<p>d. Indecent images of children.</p>

<p>34.5.3 Human tissue is held by the police or a forensic unit as part of the CJS process it is, generally, outside the provisions of the Human Tissue Act 2004 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">66</a> (see s39 of that Act). However, it is important that such tissue is managed appropriately, and the guidance issued by the Human Tissue Authority is of value in determining appropriate processes. When the tissue ceases to be required for CJS purposes it may become subject to the provisions of the Human Tissue Act 2004 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">66</a>. The codes and guidance issues by the Authority should be considered when such situations arise.</p>

<p>34.5.4 If items/exhibits are to be returned to the commissioning party, or provided for use in court, the forensic unit shall ensure that the commissioning party or court is made aware of any potential health and safety issues relating to the item/exhibit, or its handling, and take appropriate steps to minimise the risk to the commissioning party or court.</p>

<p>34.5.5 If items/exhibits are deemed too hazardous to return to the commissioning party and there is no overriding need to retain, they shall be destroyed by the forensic unit in accordance with health and safety legislation, health and safety regulations and Home Office guidelines. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:123" rel="footnote">[footnote 123]</a></sup> The requirements for retention, agreed with the commissioning party, shall also be adhered to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">35.1 </span> Inter-Laboratory Comparisons (Proficiency Tests and Collaborative Exercises)</h3>

<p>35.1.1 The forensic unit shall review the availability and appropriateness of schemes for inter-laboratory <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:124" rel="footnote">[footnote 124]</a></sup> comparisons that are relevant to its FSAs and where relevant its scope of accreditation.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:125" rel="footnote">[footnote 125]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:126" rel="footnote">[footnote 126]</a></sup></p>

<p>35.1.2 Annex C of ISO 17043:2010 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">67</a> provides useful information to assist in selection or design of schemes whether the examinations or tests are quantitative, qualitative, or interpretive in nature and annex A of the Eurachem publication on proficiency test (PT) schemes <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">68</a> includes a checklist which includes consideration of the following.</p>

<p>a. Whether the parameters included in the scheme are similar to those of items/exhibits encountered in the everyday practice of the forensic unit.</p>

<p>b. Whether the strategies for data collection and analysis applied by the PT provider are suitable for the needs of the forensic unit.</p>

<p>c. Whether the method used for assessing the participants’ performance is clearly described by the PT provider and understood by the forensic unit.</p>

<p>d. The competence of a PT provider, for example:</p>

<p>i. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 17043:2010 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">67</a>, e.g. accreditation; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:127" rel="footnote">[footnote 127]</a></sup></p>

<p>ii. Track record in delivering such schemes;</p>

<p>iii. Reliability of the assigned values; and</p>

<p>iv. Fitness for purpose of criteria for proficiency assessment.</p>

<p>35.1.3 The forensic unit shall participate in appropriate schemes, in order to monitor the validity of its examinations or tests, and its performance, both against its own requirements and against the performance of peer forensic units. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">69</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:128" rel="footnote">[footnote 128]</a></sup></p>

<p>35.1.4 When participating in inter-laboratory comparison schemes, the forensic unit’s own documented methods and procedures shall be used.</p>

<p>35.1.5 Proficiency testing records should include <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a>:</p>

<p>a. Full details of the examinations/tests undertaken;</p>

<p>b. Results and conclusions obtained;</p>

<p>c. An indication that performance has been reviewed; and</p>

<p>d. Details of the corrective action undertaken, where necessary.</p>

<p>35.1.6 Unexpected performance in proficiency tests or inter-laboratory comparisons shall be handled as non-conforming testing (23.1 - Control of Non-Conforming Examination and Testing).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.1 </span> General <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a>
</h3>

<p>36.1.1 The forensic unit shall detail in a procedure roles and responsibilities to ensure the appropriate exchange of information and authorisations. This should cover communication of reports (including evaluative reports) with the commissioning party (and as needed other parties in the CJS), as appropriate, within agreed timescales in accordance with the requirements and needs of each specific case and the known key dates in the criminal justice process.</p>

<p>36.1.2 The forensic unit shall provide early warning of any operational or scientific issues that could affect the timeliness (i.e. substantial delay) of service delivery to the commissioning party. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:129" rel="footnote">[footnote 129]</a></sup></p>

<p>36.1.3 The practitioner shall be competent and comply with all relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Rules <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a> and Criminal Practice Directions <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a>. Where evidence including opinion is provided the practitioner shall comply with the requirements for evidence of opinion <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">70</a> and the applicable obligations on expert witnesses. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a> Reports shall comply with applicable legal provisions.</p>

<p>36.1.4 Full records shall be kept of work done and the results obtained in line with other retention policies, even if the commissioning party does not require a detailed report. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:130" rel="footnote">[footnote 130]</a></sup></p>

<p>36.1.5 The forensic unit shall consider and record whether any activity by the Regulator, as described above, creates an obligation to disclose in reports issued by the forensic unit or its practitioners.</p>

<h4>Duty to Court</h4>

<p>36.1.6 Expert witnesses act as independent advisors to the court and this role creates obligations, to the court, which override any duty to the commissioning party (or anyone else). <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a></p>

<p>36.1.7 Persons acting as an expert witness shall not do anything which is contrary to their obligations to the court or fail to do something which is required by that duty.</p>

</h4>

<h5>General</h5>

<p>36.1.8 All practitioners shall disclose in reports of findings from an FSA their compliance, or non-compliance, with this Code. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:132" rel="footnote">[footnote 132]</a></sup></p>

<p>36.1.9 This Code incorporates the FSA definitions (see F3 - FSAs – Definitions subject to this Code) so a practitioner will be compliant with this Code only if they also comply with requirements set out in the relevant FSA definition (e.g. accreditation to ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> and adherence to this Code or to an appendix to this Code). <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:133" rel="footnote">[footnote 133]</a></sup></p>

<p>36.1.10 All practitioners shall declare/disclose compliance with this Code in reports intended for use as evidence (other than as evidence of agreed fact) in the following terms, or in terms substantially the same:</p>

<p>a. ‘I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have acted in accordance with the Code of Practice published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue]’; or</p>

<p>b. ‘I have not complied with the Code of Practice published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue]. The details of this non-compliance are included to the best of my knowledge and belief in Annex [x], with details of the steps taken to mitigate the risks associated with non-compliance.’</p>

<p>36.1.11 Where, in compliance with the provisions of section 36.1.10, a practitioner describes the steps taken to mitigate a non-compliance with this Code that description shall, in particular, address the following issues.</p>

<p>a. The competence of the practitioners involved in the work.</p>

<p>b. The validity of the method employed.</p>

<p>c. The documentation of the method employed.</p>

<p>d. The suitability of the equipment employed (including the approach to maintenance and calibration).</p>

<p>e. The suitability of the environment in which the work is undertaken.</p>

<p>36.1.12 The Regulator may issue guidance on making declarations.</p>

<h4>Declarations and Changes to Accreditation Status</h4>

<p>36.1.13 Forensic units shall promptly and as soon as practicably possible report to the Regulator any suspension, withdrawal, or change in their accreditation status (and/or the accreditation status of any organisations providing external forensic services), where the suspension, withdrawal, or change in accreditation means that the forensic unit is no longer compliant with the Code as set out in the accreditation that previously applied to the FSAs or work undertaken by the forensic unit.</p>

<p>36.1.14 If such a situation arises, the forensic unit should take the following steps.</p>

<p>a. The forensic unit shall inform the investigation and prosecution authorities identifying all cases affected by the change in accreditation status, making specific reference to Section 4 of the Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a> and noting that any statements or reports that are affected are no longer compliant with the Code.</p>

<p>b. The forensic unit should set out in their report to the Regulator:</p>

<p>i. the basis and reasons for the suspension, withdrawal or change in accreditation;</p>

<p>ii. any action that has been taken to deal with issues that have led to suspension, withdrawal or change in accreditation; and</p>

<p>iii. the impact of any suspension, withdrawal or change in accreditation on the results or opinions that have been made in any statements or reports.</p>

<p>c. The forensic unit shall use appropriate and risk-based strategies to consider where amendments to witness reports are required as a result of changes to accreditation status or compliance with the Code. The Regulator may advise the forensic unit in determining what amendments to reports are appropriate.</p>

<p>36.1.15 The Regulator may publish a notice on the Regulator’s website setting out the detail of the suspension, withdrawal or change in accreditation and the impact based on the above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.2 </span> Types of Report in the CJS</h3>

<p>36.2.1 Forensic units, or practitioners working in forensic units, may be required to supply reports to support the judicial process which is covered by the requirements in this Code including the provision of the following.</p>

<p>a. Interim progress reports <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:134" rel="footnote">[footnote 134]</a></sup> to support criminal investigations. These are initial forensic reports used to inform an enquiry, interview, or strategy. This report is not intended for use as evidence but may be disclosable as unused material and does not require a statement of compliance with this Code (see 36.1.8 et seq - Declarations of Compliance and Non-Compliance with Required Standards).</p>

<p>b. Streamlined Forensic Reports (SFR) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">72</a>. These have been introduced for certain evidence types for use in the case management process to establish the level of agreement between the defence and the prosecution.</p>

<p>i. The SFR1 is a summary of the evidence served to determine whether there is any agreement of the evidence, or to ascertain whether there are any issues in dispute. It is deliberately not presented in an admissible format as it is not intended to be presented at trial other than as agreed fact and it does not need to comply with provisions with regard to reports contained in the Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a> or Criminal Practice Directions V 19B <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a>. It does however require a statement of compliance with this Code for FSAs subject to this Code, and a statement of whether the results are from a method which requires accreditation and if so, if the method is within the forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:135" rel="footnote">[footnote 135]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:136" rel="footnote">[footnote 136]</a></sup></p>

<p>ii. The SFR2 is produced to answer the issue(s) raised by the defence in response to the SFR1, it is intended to be presented in evidence, unless a full evaluative report is required instead. Therefore, an SFR2 does require a statement of compliance with this Code for FSAs subject to this Code, and if it is providing evidence of opinion it requires an expert’s declaration under Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a>.</p>

<p>c. Reports (a statement is a type of report) for use in court proceedings.</p>

<p>i. Factual reports require a statement of compliance with this Code.</p>

<p>ii. Expert reports including opinion evidence require a declaration under Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4(j) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a>and 19B of the Criminal Practice Directions V <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a> which should include a statement of compliance with this Code as part of the declaration required by 19B of the Criminal Practice Directions V <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a>.</p>

<p>iii. The court may extend a number of the requirements applicable to evidence of opinion to expert evidence of fact (See Part 19 Criminal Procedure Rules <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a>).</p>

<p>d. Certificates (e.g. issued under provisions of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">73</a>).</p>

<p>i. The content of a certificate must comply with the provisions of the statute which created the right to use the certificate. Unless the statute prohibits it, a certificate should include a statement of compliance with this Code.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36.3 </span> Opinions and Interpretations</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>36.3.1 Where opinions and interpretation are to be included in a forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation, the forensic unit will need to ensure that it is acting in compliance with the UKAS publication LAB 13 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">74</a> and ILAC-G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> section 4.9. If the forensic unit is accredited by an accreditation body other than UKAS, it shall be in compliance with ILAC-G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> and the requirements of that body in relation for opinions and interpretation.</p>

<h4>Evaluative Opinions</h4>

<p>36.3.2 A forensic unit providing evaluative opinion evidence shall meet the following requirements.</p>

<p>a. The policies and procedure for case assessment and interpretation shall be part of the quality management system.</p>

<p>b. The policies and procedures for making reports of evaluative opinion shall be part of the quality management system. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:137" rel="footnote">[footnote 137]</a></sup></p>

<p>c. The method for evaluation shall be validated according to this Code.</p>

<p>d. The policies and procedures shall require there is clarity in any report as to the source(s) of data used in forming the evaluative opinion. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:138" rel="footnote">[footnote 138]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:139" rel="footnote">[footnote 139]</a></sup></p>

<p>e. Experts providing evaluative opinion shall be demonstrably competent to do so (see also 26.3.7).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:140" rel="footnote">[footnote 140]</a></sup></p>

<p>f. Any statistical models and assumptions involved in the evaluation shall be clear to the CJS and shall be valid.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:141" rel="footnote">[footnote 141]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:142" rel="footnote">[footnote 142]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">37.1 </span> Scope</h3>

<p>37.1.1 This section of this Code applies to situations where the work of a forensic unit (the initial unit) is reviewed by a different forensic unit. This covers, but is not limited to, the following situations.</p>

<p>a. A review commissioned by the same party that commissioned the initial work (e.g. a cold case review).</p>

<p>b. A review commissioned by another party to the case (e.g. a defence examination).</p>

<p>c. A review commissioned by a body with legal authority to do so (e.g. the Criminal Cases Review Commission or a public enquiry).</p>

<p>d. A review commissioned by the Regulator.</p>

<p>37.1.2 There may be a number of secondary reviews in any case and these may be concurrent or sequential.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">37.2 </span> General</h3>

<p>a. The retention period <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:148" rel="footnote">[footnote 148]</a></sup> for records that that satisfy the requirements of legislation, its accrediting body, the party commissioning the work <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">22</a>, and this Code. The retention of records policy shall consider the following.</p>

<p>i. Full records shall be kept of work done and the results obtained in line with other retention policies, even if the commissioning party does not require a detailed report (including any statement).</p>

<p>ii. Obsolete/superseded documents, taking into account commissioning party <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">22</a>, regulatory, and legal requirements (see section 20).</p>

<p>iii. Non-conformities or complaints and the subsequent reviews and outcomes in line with the case file retention period.</p>

<p>iv. For the period of record retention, traceability shall be maintained for all names, initials, and/or identifiers. These should be legible and understandable.</p>

<p>v. Training manuals, training and competence assessment records in line with the policy for retention of case files.</p>

<p>38.1.3 The retention policy shall ensure the retention, return, or destruction items/exhibits (see 34.5 – Item/Exhibit Return and Disposal) meets the legal obligations placed on the forensic unit or assists, or at least does not interfere with, obligations placed on the commissioning party.</p>

<p>38.1.4 Forensic units can be the commissioning body, with external forensic units acting as sub-contractors or external service providers. The retention requirements for items/exhibits and any copies of items/exhibits should be set out in any contractual agreements between the commissioning body and forensic unit being commissioned (see section 22).</p>

<p>38.1.5 Original items/exhibits collected or seized by, or submitted to, forensic units should be returned to the commissioning body, normally as soon as possible after the FSA is complete and/or the case is reported, except where:</p>

<p>a. They fall within the special provisions, such as being a biohazard, or have other controls stipulated by the commissioning body;</p>

<p>b. They are/were submitted to NaBIS; and/or</p>

<p>c. Agreement is reached for the forensic unit to retain them, or part of them, under specialised storage conditions, for an agreed and lawful purpose.</p>

<p>38.1.6 The Criminal Procedure Rules place requirements on all parties who want to introduce evidence of opinion to assist with access to the records of examinations, measurements, tests, or experiments which were used to generate the opinions expressed by the expert. However, it is not a general right for access to all information the forensic unit is required to retain. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:149" rel="footnote">[footnote 149]</a></sup></p>

<p>38.1.7 Forensic units commissioned by the prosecution must support the disclosure process and provide access to the defence to material identified as relevant by the prosecution. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">26</a></p>

<p>38.1.8 All documents, items/exhibits and evidential material recovered from items/exhibits that are retained by forensic units shall be archived in secure storage, in conditions to prevent damage or deterioration, and indexed so as to facilitate orderly storage and retrieval. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:150" rel="footnote">[footnote 150]</a></sup></p>

<p>38.1.9 Only personnel authorised by management shall have access to the retained materials. Movement of material in and out of the archives shall be recorded.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">39. </span> Demonstration of Compliance</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">39.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>39.1.1 The Regulator requires, for certain FSAs, that forensic units shall demonstrate compliance with this Code in a particular manner.</p>

<p>39.1.2 Where the Regulator has established such a requirement it is set out in section 9 and in the appendix relevant to the FSA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">39.2 </span> Accreditation</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>39.2.1 For any FSA the Regulator may require a forensic unit undertaking the FSA to achieve and maintain any combination of the following.</p>

<p>a. Accreditation to an appropriate international standard. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:151" rel="footnote">[footnote 151]</a></sup></p>

<p>b. The accreditation includes adherence to the requirements of this Code.</p>

<p>39.2.2 All forensic units undertaking an FSA which is subject to this Code are bound by this Code (which may include, or be restricted to, one, or more, of the appendices) to the extent set out in the appendices. The method of demonstrating compliance with this Code is through accreditation to ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a>, ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> and/or ISO 15189 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">18</a> with adherence to this Code recorded in the schedule of accreditation. There may be exceptions to this requirement, and they will be set out in the appendices.</p>

<p>39.2.3 The appropriate international standard, or standards, for FSAs subject to an accreditation requirement is provided at section 9 and in the relevant appendices.</p>

<p>39.2.4 The requirement for accreditation may incorporate the application of documents the Regulator considers to be relevant (e.g. UKAS LAB 13 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">74</a>). Such documents will be listed in section 11.2 - Normative References.</p>

<p>39.2.5 Accreditation to an international standard will only be considered to have met the requirement if:</p>

<p>a. The schedule of accreditation covers those sub-activities of the FSA defined as being required to be within the accreditation scope (subject to the provisions with regard to infrequently used methods); and</p>

<p>b. The forensic unit has signed a waiver of confidentiality to allow the accreditation body to share information with the Regulator.</p>

<h4>New Methods</h4>

<p>39.2.6 It is recognised a new method may require a period of time from introduction to obtain suitable data to demonstrate the operation of the process or procedure satisfactorily for an accreditation body to include this method within the forensic unit’s schedule of accreditation. Forensic units intending to introduce such methods should consider the applicability of the provisions around infrequently used methods set out in section 28.3.50 et seq and/or discuss options with the accreditation body. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:152" rel="footnote">[footnote 152]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Infrequently Used Methods</h4>

<p>39.2.7 Where this Code establishes, for an FSA, a requirement for accreditation to an international standard the forensic unit shall achieve and maintain such accreditation.</p>

<p>39.2.8 The schedule of accreditation shall cover the FSA, but it is not required to cover methods which are infrequently used methods within the provisions of section 28.3.50 et seq.</p>

<p>39.2.9 Nothing in sections 39.2.7 and 39.2.8 should be taken as overriding the provisions of The Accreditation of Forensic Service Provider Regulations 2018 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">16</a>.</p>

<h4>Exigent Circumstances</h4>

<p>39.2.10 Where accreditation is required, and exigent circumstances mean that a method other than that as detailed in the schedule of accreditation needs to be used and there is no legal impediment, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:153" rel="footnote">[footnote 153]</a></sup> this should be made clear to the commissioning party and the fact that accreditation should apply and was not held should be declared in any reports. Section 36.1.8 et seq ’Declarations of Compliance and Non-Compliance with Required Standards’ details some options for declarations. The expectation is that, where any required standard is not met fully, in addition to the declaration a separate annex <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:154" rel="footnote">[footnote 154]</a></sup> to the report is also produced which details how the risk is mitigated.</p>

<h4>Accreditation Bodies</h4>

<h5>General</h5>

<p>39.2.11 Any requirement for accreditation will only be achieved if the accreditation is issued by an accreditation body recognised by the Regulator.</p>

<p>39.2.12 An accreditation body will only be recognised by the Regulator if the following conditions are met.</p>

<p>a. The body is recognised as an accreditation body by the Government of the country/territory in which it operates.</p>

<p>b. It provides, or is seeking to provide, accreditation in a country/territory where it is legally appointed to do so.</p>

<p>c. It will only accredit forensic units against this Code where the unit has signed a confidentiality waiver as required by section 39.2.5.</p>

<p>d. It incorporates this Code in the schedule of accreditation.</p>

<p>e. The requirements of ILAC G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> are incorporated into the accreditation process.</p>

<p>f. It has entered, and operates in accordance with, a data sharing agreement with the Regulator which addresses the issues in section 39.2.16.</p>

<p>39.2.13 The Regulator recognises that the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy take a position on behalf of Government that there will be a single National Accreditation Body for the UK, and that UKAS is appointed as the sole UK National Accreditation Body by the Accreditation Regulations 2009 (S.I. No 2009/3155) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">78</a> and Schedule 33 of the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/696) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">79</a>.</p>

<p>39.2.14 The conformity assessment and accreditation policy in the UK from the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy requires UK conformity assessment bodies seeking accreditation to do so from UKAS as the sole National Accreditation Body for the UK.</p>

<p>39.2.15 UKAS is a non-profit-distributing private company, limited by guarantee. It operates as an independent body providing a public authority activity and operating in the public interest.</p>

<h5>Data Sharing</h5>

<p>39.2.16 The data sharing agreement mentioned in section 39.2.12 must achieve the following.</p>

<p>a. The accreditation body must be able to share any concerns or information about a forensic unit with the Regulator.</p>

<p>b. The Regulator must be able to share any concerns or information about a forensic unit with the accreditation body.</p>

<p>c. The accreditation body must be able to provide the Regulator with any information about the number of bodies accredited.</p>

<p>39.2.17 The Regulator may share information related to any quality concerns about a forensic unit with the appropriate accreditation body or accreditation bodies.</p>

<h5>UKAS</h5>

<p>39.2.18 UKAS will, at least in non-scene based FSAs, where this Code requires accreditation, assess forensic units undertaking FSAs against ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> or ISO 15189 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">18</a> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:155" rel="footnote">[footnote 155]</a></sup> utilising any of the relevant UKAS laboratory publications <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">80</a>, ILAC-G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> and the supplementary requirements of this Code, and will, if the forensic unit has achieved the requisite standards, include compliance with this Code in the Schedule of Accreditation. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:156" rel="footnote">[footnote 156]</a></sup> UKAS can assess forensic units providing FSAs at scenes of incidents <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:157" rel="footnote">[footnote 157]</a></sup> against ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a>, ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a>, ILAC-G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a>, ILAC-P15 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">81</a>, this Code, and the inspection recommendation and guidance publication UKAS-RG 201 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">17</a>.</p>

<h4>Accreditation Issues</h4>

<p>39.2.19 The Regulator has based the accreditation requirements in this Code on the use of the international standards ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> and ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a>.</p>

<p>39.2.20 Accreditation to ISO 15189 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">18</a> is a suitable alternative to ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> for undertaking certain FSA, provided that ‘Forensic Testing/Analysis’ is clearly indicated in the scope of accreditation; this means that the forensic unit has been assessed in accordance with ISO 15189 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">18</a> taking into account ILAC-G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a>. The FSA for which accreditation to ISO 15189 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">18</a> is appropriate are set out in the FSA definitions.</p>

<p>39.2.21 Other standards used for certification of organisations that provide scientific services – e.g. Good Laboratory Practice regulations <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">82</a> and Good Manufacturing Practice <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">83</a> are not alternatives to ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a>, ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> or ISO 15189 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">18</a>, although they do overlap to some extent and provide compatible guidance on good practice.</p>

<h2>Part F – Appendices</h2>

<h2>F1 - Infrequently Commissioned Experts</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">40. </span> Infrequently Commissioned Experts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">40.1 </span> Scope</h3>

<p>40.1.1 It is recognised that experts from outside the forensic science profession will be called to give evidence, in relation to an FSA, from time to time. This could include technologists and material scientists from manufacturing industry (e.g. glass, textiles, building materials). These shall be referred to as Infrequently Commissioned Experts (ICE). Where ICE provide advice/evidence in relation to an FSA which is subject to this Code it is impractical to require (a) compliance with all provisions of this Code or (b) compliance with the means of demonstrating compliance (e.g. accreditation).</p>

<p>40.1.2 An individual shall only fall within the definition of an ICE if the conditions in section 40.1.3 are met in relation to both the practitioner and the evidence provided.</p>

<p>40.1.3 The practitioner, subject to the provisions of section 40.1.4, shall:</p>

<p>a. Not be a member of staff of a forensic unit providing services to the CJS in England and Wales;</p>

<p>b. Not represent themselves as a forensic scientist operating within the CJS in England and Wales; and</p>

<p>c. Not have been involved, in an advisory or expert capacity, in any case in the CJS in England and Wales in the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>40.1.4 Provision of evidence to a different justice system (e.g. Family Justice System) is not deemed to contribute to the frequency with which a person has any involvement in the CJS and so does not have bearing on the status of ICE.</p>

<p>40.1.5 The evidence provided by an ICE shall not be of a type which can routinely be obtained from a forensic unit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">40.2 </span> Requirements</h3>

<p>40.2.1 ICE shall comply with the following requirements.</p>

<p>a. The general obligations of expert witnesses <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a> including the requirements of the CJS as contained in the Criminal Procedure Rules <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">84</a> (and Criminal Practice Directions V, in particular 19A.5 and 19B <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a>).</p>

<p>b. The requirements for contents of reports <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:158" rel="footnote">[footnote 158]</a></sup>, including but not limited to, those prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Rules 19.4 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a> and Criminal Practice Directions V 19B <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a>.</p>

<p>c. Retention, recording, revelation and disclosure obligations.</p>

<p>d. The requirements pertaining to the use of reference collections and databases should they rely on them.</p>

<p>e. The requirement to use validated methods or procedures based on sound scientific principles and methodology.</p>

<p>f. The need to demonstrate competence in using these methods or procedures, and evaluating the results obtained objectively and impartially, and according to established scientific and statistical methodology.</p>

<p>g. The need to consider the impact that confirmation/cognitive bias can have at different stages and use appropriate avoidance strategies.</p>

<p>h. The declaration required in the Criminal Practice Directions V 19B <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a> and the Regulator’s requirement for the positive declaration to be in the following terms: <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:159" rel="footnote">[footnote 159]</a></sup></p>

<p>“I confirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have acted in accordance with the Code of Practice published by the Forensic Science Regulator [insert issue] as it pertains to experts from other professions. Annex [x] details the steps taken to comply with the specific requirements set for experts from other professions.”</p>

<h2>F2 - FSA Definitions – General Provisions</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">41. </span> Purpose</h2>

<p>41.1.1 To avoid considerable repetition in the definitions of FSAs, in the FSA specific appendices, this section addresses conditions and provisions which apply generally.</p>

<p>41.1.2 The definition of FSAs are mutually exclusive in that each FSA is a definition of a discrete forensic science activity, there is no overlap or duplication in the FSA definitions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">41.2 </span> The Regulator’s Interpretation of the Standards and Required Compliance</h3>

<p>41.2.1 ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> is a standard for inspection activity and applies to incident scenes because there is a need to take a holistic view to interpreting and examining the incident scene. ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> is most appropriate where the forensic unit reviews the incident scene and formulates a strategy to interpret the events at the incident scene and identify the significance of material for subsequent recovery and/or testing; some of this testing could in some circumstances be conducted at the scene, for example, presumptive testing for blood. This at scene testing could be conducted by the forensic unit who hold accreditation to ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> or the forensic unit holding ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> could request another forensic unit to conduct this testing under ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a>.</p>

<p>41.2.2 ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> is a standard for testing activity and applies to material that is examined in controlled conditions. The practitioner undertaking the test needs to understand the context of the criminal investigation but only addresses specific aspects.</p>

<p>41.2.3 Where a forensic unit holds ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> accreditation for an FSA in a dedicated facility, the unit could extend the scope of its ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> accreditation to include testing at scenes, and/or at a location away from the dedicated facility (for example a police station on items that have been identified in advance). Once granted, this extension to scope would be included within the forensic unit’s ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> schedule of accreditation.</p>

<p>41.2.4 Where an FSA definition requires accreditation to an ISO standard, it must be conditioned by ILAC G19 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">3</a> to make the accreditation relevant for forensic analysis.</p>

<p>41.2.5 For FSAs that involve scenes, the accreditation body will also utilise UKAS RG 201 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">17</a> as part of the accreditation.</p>

<p>41.2.6 For interpretation and opinions, e.g. activity level interpretation, the accreditation body may also consider the utilisation of UKAS LAB 13 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">74</a> as part of the accreditation.</p>

<p>41.2.7 Where applicable, FSA definitions will identify any appendices in the Code that set out specific requirements for that FSA, which condition accreditation to ISO standards.</p>

<p>41.2.8 Subject to the provisions below, forensic units shall demonstrate compliance with the Code by having accreditation to an appropriate ISO standard with the schedule of accreditation including the Code.</p>

<p>41.2.9 On the day the Code becomes effective, forensic units shall have accreditation for FSAs they undertake which have a requirement for accreditation. This accreditation does not need to include the Code in the schedule of accreditation on the day the Code becomes effective.</p>

<p>41.2.10 24 months past when the Code becomes effective (see section 10.1.3), forensic units shall have accreditation for FSAs they undertake which have a requirement for accreditation, and the schedule of accreditation shall include the Code.</p>

<p>41.2.11 In some FSAs there is allowance of a deferment to achieve accreditation, and this is clear in those FSAs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">99.3 </span> DNA Consumables</h3>

<p>99.3.1 Consumables and reagents used for recovery and analysis of DNA shall be demonstrated to be forensic DNA grade through quality assurance testing in the form of batch testing to demonstrate successful clean production standards, or using a validated technique of post-production treatment, or both. This requirement also applies to reagents used in processes upstream from DNA processing in joint, split, or sequential cases involving other disciplines.</p>

<p>99.3.2 Assurance is to be provided through the use of consumables declared as compliant with PAS 377<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:178" rel="footnote">[footnote 178]</a></sup>, ‘Consumables used in the collection, preservation and processing of material for forensic analysis – Product, manufacturing and forensic kit assembly – Specification’ which incorporates the requirements of ISO 18385 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">110</a>. Consumables compliant with PAS377 negates the requirement for end user acceptance batch testing.</p>

<p>99.3.3 Materials used shall not have levels of DNA that can be detected by sensitive STR casework methods in use, nor leach any chemicals (for example, plasticizers) that may affect the processes used or the results obtained from the analysis.</p>

<p>99.3.4 Validation shall demonstrate consistency in recovery and release of DNA for sampling materials used (for example, swabs). Ongoing verification of the performance across batches shall be evidenced by quality control (QC) testing.</p>

<p>99.3.5 Any changes in composition of the sampling material shall be risk assessed and either validated or verified to ensure that the performance is as good as, or better than, previously validated sampling materials.</p>

<p>99.3.6 Post-production treatment of DNA consumables, such as ethylene oxide treatment, shall include QC for each treatment, such as DNA spiked samples placed at various locations throughout the batch to be treated, which demonstrate the required reduction level of amplifiable DNA (at least 1,000-fold) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">111</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">110</a>. Post-treatment QC testing is not required unless the QC results monitoring the efficiency of the post-production treatment fails or casts doubt on the reduction level required.</p>

<p>99.3.7 For consumables that cannot undergo ethylene oxide treatment, then evidence that there is no gross or systemic contamination shall be demonstrated by QC testing. The batch testing criteria is set out in PAS 377 for the batch to be considered acceptable.</p>

<p>99.3.8 Consumables that fail shall be embargoed and investigated further, following repeat batch testing consumables that continue to fail should be rejected for use. For consumables that have undergone postproduction treatment, such as ethylene oxide treatment, then another treatment might resolve the issue.</p>

<p>99.3.9 The testing shall be traceable, and the exact nature of the test and the results shall be made available to end users.</p>

<p>99.3.10 Areas used for the storage and handling of consumables, samples, and exhibits shall be secure and access restricted to authorised personnel only.</p>

<p>d. precautions shall be taken to minimise the contamination of consumables prior to and during use.</p>

<p>99.4.3 Any detected or reported problems with packaging or materials already in the evidential chain will require an appropriate risk or case assessment to be undertaken and where appropriate for the material to be removed from the DNA supply chain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">99.5 </span> Contamination Avoidance, Monitoring and Detection</h3>

<p>99.5.1 The forensic unit shall have policies and procedures in place for contamination management. Steps shall be taken to prevent or minimise contamination between:</p>

<p>a. personnel and the exhibit/DNA sample;</p>

<p>b. contaminated consumables (for example, swabs, tubes, PPE/barrier clothing) and the exhibit/DNA sample;</p>

<p>c. exhibits and DNA samples; and</p>

<p>d. contaminated equipment and exhibit/DNA sample.</p>

<p>99.5.2 Steps shall be taken to ensure that appropriate precautions are taken to minimise the contamination of consumables prior to use.</p>

<p>99.5.3 Protective/barrier clothing shall be worn by all individuals entering crime scenes, examination, recovery, and processing areas.</p>

<p>99.5.4 Procedures in place shall minimise the transfer of DNA by defining when the PPE/barrier clothing shall be cleaned and/or changed.</p>

<p>99.5.5 To provide confidence to forensic practitioners that interpret the distribution of particular body fluids obtained from individuals in sexual offence cases and opine on activity, so as to avoid cross contamination between sites/areas sampled during the forensic medical examination of sexual assault patients then gloves shall be changed between each site/area sampled.</p>

<p>99.5.6 Segregation of items and the handling of items potentially in the same case shall be observed at all times, for example, scene and suspect, victim and suspect, different suspects, different locations within a scene, and multiple scenes</p>

<p>99.5.7 All items shall be stored in such a manner that they cannot be cross contaminated, tampered with, or stolen.</p>

<p>99.5.8 The forensic unit shall have policies and procedures to ensure that the cleaning chemicals and methods used are validated and shown to be effective at removing DNA.</p>

<p>99.5.9 Equipment shall be cleaned prior to use and according to documented standard.</p>

<p>99.5.11 Anti-contamination records shall be kept, these include:</p>

<p>a. room access logs;</p>

<p>b. cleaning logs; and</p>

<p>c. environmental monitoring records.</p>

<p>99.5.13 The forensic unit shall have policies and procedures to ensure that access to crime scenes, examination, recovery, and processing areas is restricted to individuals covered by an adequate DNA elimination database(s). Forensic units and practitioners undertaking FSAs with the intention that the output be used in the CJS in England and Wales shall have due regard of FSR-P-302 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">108</a> issued under the provisions of section 9(1) of the 2021 Act <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">99.6 </span> Selection of Methods</h3>

<p>99.6.1 Forensic units shall use a validated method(s) for recovering body fluids and trace (touch) DNA for downstream testing.</p>

<p>99.6.2 Forensic units shall use a validated method(s) for the identification of body fluid material. As most body fluid identification screening tests are presumptive, the results of these tests shall be provided as an opinion.</p>

<p>99.6.3 Forensic units analysing DNA shall use a validated human specific quantification technique for casework samples, which is verified to demonstrate its limit of detection, limit of quantitation, accuracy, reproducibility, and measurement of uncertainty appropriate to the sensitivity of the DNA profiling service offered. Quantification of reference samples from individuals is unnecessary, as there is sufficient material for re-work.</p>

<p>99.6.4 Where the quantification method used is incapable of demonstrating whether polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition is likely to occur due to the nature of the tested sample, then the possibility of inhibition shall be explored when an unexpected partial or no profile has been obtained.</p>

<p>99.6.5 In exceptional instances, where in the professional opinion of the scientist a separate quantification step normally required in a protocol is not advisable (that is, the amount of available evidential material risks the ability to obtain an interpretable profile) or not required, this shall be clearly communicated to the customer, be documented and available for disclosure purposes.</p>

<p>99.6.6 For rapid DNA devices, if quantification is not an integral part of the case work analytical method, then alternative means to assess and address the effects of both degradation and inhibition for each casework sample type are required as some samples are irreplaceable and samples are of variable composition, quality, and quantity.</p>

<p>99.6.7 Forensic units and practitioners undertaking forensic science activities with the intention that the output be used in the CJS in England and Wales shall have due regard of the ‘Methods Employing Rapid DNA Devices’ <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">119</a> guidance issued under the provisions of section 9(1) of the 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">10</a>.</p>

<span class="number">101.1 </span> Scope</h3>

<p>101.1.1 FSA Definition – Friction Ridge Detail: Visualisation and Enhancement (See section 57) can be carried out at a dedicated facility, or as a specialist activity carried out at a scene. Accreditation to ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> for laboratory and laboratory based activities extended to incident scenes is required; where only scene activity is conducted then accreditation ISO 17020 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">2</a> applies.</p>

<p>101.1.2 Visualisation and imaging of Friction Ridge Detail does not operate in isolation, and it shall be recognised that the activities are part of the fingerprint examination workflow.</p>

<p>101.1.3 It also includes activities relating to decision making prior to visualisation and post-visualisation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">101.2 </span> Terms And Definitions</h3>

<p>101.2.1 The term ‘friction ridge detail’ includes all areas of the friction ridge skin system on the fingers, palms, phalanges and feet (plantar).</p>

<p>101.2.2 For the purposes of this document, the term ‘process’ refers to the entire method/actions of recovering areas of friction ridge detail (i.e. multiple linked stages) whilst ‘technique’ refers to individual visualisation methods, for example, ninhydrin.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">102.13 </span> Reporting The Results</h3>

<h4>Reporting outcomes</h4>

<p>102.13.1 The comparison of fingerprints is a cognitive process that relies on the competence of the practitioners to perform examinations and form conclusions based on their findings. The conclusions drawn shall be made based on their skill and experience; however, the basis for these conclusions shall be traceable and clearly evidenced.</p>

<p>102.13.2 Regardless of the certainty in the mind of a fingerprint practitioner once a conclusion is reached, the evidence presented shall be considered as an opinion, not a statement of fact.</p>

<p>102.13.3 Any report or statement shall disclose whether practitioners involved in the examination are in disagreement with the reporting outcome.</p>

<p>102.13.4 Differences of opinion in the reporting outcomes shall be noted and documented in the case file and disclosed.</p>

<p>102.13.5 The test method (ACE-V) will deliver one of the following outcomes:</p>

<p>a. Identified; A practitioner term used to describe the mark as being attributed to a particular individual/person. There is sufficient quality and quantity of ridge flow, ridge characteristics and/or detail in agreement with no unexplainable differences that in the opinion of the practitioner two areas of friction ridge detail were made by the same person.</p>

<p>b. Excluded; There are sufficient features in disagreement to conclude that two areas of friction ridge impressions did not originate from the same person</p>

<p>c. Insufficient; The ridge flow and/or ridge characteristics revealed in the area of friction ridge detail (mark) are of such low quantity and/or poor quality that a reliable comparison cannot be made. The area of ridge detail contains insufficient clarity of ridges and characteristics or has been severely compromised by extraneous forces (for example, superimposition, movement) to render the detail present as unreliable and not suitable to proffer any other decision</p>

<p>d. Inconclusive; The determination that the level of agreement and/or disagreement is such that it is not possible either to conclude that the areas of friction ridge detail originated from the same donor, or to exclude the particular individual as a source for the unknown impression/mark.</p>

<p>102.13.6 When reporting an inconclusive outcome an explanation as to why the outcome is inconclusive should be given.</p>

<p>102.13.7 The Forensic Unit shall meet the requirements of LAB 13 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">74</a> in relation to the provision of opinions and interpretations related to friction ridge detail comparison and have this included in their ISO 17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> scope of accreditation.</p>

<p>102.13.8 The Forensic Unit shall have policy that clearly defines the process for the provision, amendment, and retention of both written and verbal reports.</p>

<p>102.13.9 Where reports contain opinions that rely on results obtained from data or tests performed by the fingermark enhancement laboratory these shall be recorded.</p>

<p>102.13.10 Forensic Units shall recognise that practitioners may be influenced in their decisions by contextual information. Processes and procedures shall be put in place to safeguard against the risk of cognitive bias and influence. Such processes could include, but not necessarily be limited to:</p>

<p>a. The use of blind verification; and</p>

<p>b. Awareness training proportional to:</p>

<p>i. The level of responsibility; and</p>

<p>ii. The degree of exposure to situations that may be prone to bias.</p>

<p>102.13.11 All reports of the examination results that are produced shall be subject to a defined quality check, including critical findings review of the examination prior to being communicated to the recipient. If there is a need to provide results prior to the production of this quality checked final report, for example, then the provisional status of the results shall be made clear to the recipient through the use of appropriate caveats.</p>

<p>102.13.12 Legal obligations are set out FSR-I-400 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a> and disclosure requirements in the CPS Guidance for Experts on Disclosure, Unused Material and Case Management. The requirements for expert and non-expert statements are set out in FSR-G-200 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">70</a> and FSR-G-225 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">71</a> respectively. The Regulator will also publish a guidance document on terminology in fingerprint comparison.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">103. </span> The Analysis and Reporting of Forensic Specimens for s5A of the Road Traffic Act 1988</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">103.1 </span> Scope</h3>

<p>103.1.1 This section is published by the Regulator to establish the requirements for, and a common approach to, the analysis and reporting of the concentrations of certain drugs in relation to offences under s5A Road Traffic Act 1988 (drug driving) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a>.</p>

<p>103.1.2 This document applies to analysis of whole blood <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:179" rel="footnote">[footnote 179]</a></sup> samples in relation to the FSA Definition – Toxicology: Analysis for Drugs in Relation to s5A of the Road Traffic Act 1988.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">103.2 </span> Provisions</h3>

<h4>Home Office Specification</h4>

<p>103.2.1 The Home Office, in conjunction with the Department for Transport, issued a specification for the analysis of blood in relation to s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> when it is undertaken at the instruction of the police or prosecuting authorities in England and Wales. This section does not replace or detract from the specification in relation to work done in England and Wales.</p>

<h4>Terminology</h4>

<p>103.2.2 The analytical method is required to report the concentration of a drug in a sample as the mean of the result of a number of analyses. To ensure clarity the term ‘standard deviation’ shall mean the standard deviation derived using the results of the individual analyses or on the basis of reporting individual analyses. The term ‘standard deviation of the mean’ (SDM) shall mean the standard deviation calculated using the mean of the results of multiple analyses as the reported result for a sample or on the basis that the reported result will be the mean of multiple analyses. In some texts the SDM is referred to as the ‘standard error’ or the ‘standard error of the mean’.</p>

<h4>Sample Storage</h4>

<p>103.2.3 The drugs covered by the s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> offence may be subject to degradation over time. The forensic unit shall use storage methods which demonstrably minimise such degradation.</p>

<p>103.2.4 The forensic unit should consider the storage of samples prior to submission and may advise whether analysis is likely to be worthwhile; and may provide customers with advice as to how to store samples to maintain their integrity for analysis.</p>

<h4>Requirements for Analysis</h4>

<p>103.2.5 Any forensic unit undertaking analysis of whole blood where the results may be used for a prosecution under s5A Road Traffic Act 1988 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> shall meet the following requirements.</p>

<p>103.2.6 The forensic unit should consider the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">121</a> on general forensic toxicology issued by the United Kingdom and Ireland Association of Forensic Toxicologists (UKIAFT) in developing analytical processes. Compliance with this guidance is not mandatory and its contents do not override the requirements of this Code or the relevant accreditation body.</p>

<h4>Environmental Requirements</h4>

<p>103.2.7 The following environmental requirements shall be addressed.</p>

<p>a. Analysis for the purpose of s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> shall be conducted separately from work involving bulk drugs. This means that bulk drug cases shall not be conducted in the same laboratory or analytical batch as s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> analysis.</p>

<p>b. Analysis of samples for the purpose of s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> casework shall be conducted separately, in terms of both space and analytical batch, from batches of other toxicological case work (other than s5A or s4 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a>) that may contain high levels of drugs (for example suspected overdose cases in post mortem casework). Separation may be achieved by management of space employed to ensure the risk of contamination is minimised by separating work in time and carrying out appropriate environmental checks.</p>

<p>c. Environmental monitoring shall be conducted to determine the presence and approximate level of any drugs being tested for in relation to s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> in the laboratory in which the sample preparation and analysis are undertaken, in particular for cocaine, amphetamine and methylamphetamine. This should include the use of the matrix blank samples. The appearance of a drug in a sample (e.g. QC sample or blank) where that drug should not have been present will also be monitored. The presence of a drug in a solvent blank where that drug was present in the case sample analysed immediately before the solvent blank will be taken to be the result of carry over as opposed to contamination.</p>

<p>d. The data produced by environmental monitoring shall be reviewed to ensure the level, if any, of drugs in the environment is managed.</p>

<h4>Analytical Requirements</h4>

<p>103.2.8 The analytical method shall, for each drug the laboratory analyses in relation to a potential s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> offence, achieve the following requirements.</p>

<p>a. The analysis shall be sufficiently specific for each drug such that the results can be relied on as measuring the concentration of the drug.</p>

<p>b. The analytical method shall ensure the results can be attributed to the sample from which they are believed to come from. This will include procedures to ensure traceability as well as address the potential for carry over.</p>

<p>c. To protect against the risk of carry over a solvent blank shall, subject to the following point, be run before each case sample and the results from this blank shall not show the presence of any relevant drugs. This requirement will not require a solvent blank between two case samples where they are aliquots from the same case sample.</p>

<p>d. The forensic unit shall have a policy on the nature and frequency of the calibration of the method to ensure the results are robust.</p>

<p>e. For any part of the analysis employing a chromatographic method the forensic unit:</p>

<p>i. Shall ensure that QCs are extracted and analysed alongside the case samples which will form the batch to check that the instrument calibration is still valid;</p>

<p>ii. Shall ensure that data points generated from calibrators are only omitted from the generation of the ‘calibration curve’ in exceptional circumstances and if this is allowed by an in-house policy on identification of ‘outliers’ which complies with UKAS LAB 51 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">122</a>;</p>

<p>iii. Shall ensure any omission of calibration data from the generation of the ‘calibration curve’ is justified and recorded;</p>

<p>iv. Shall have requirements for an acceptable ‘calibration curve’ which implement the requirements of UKAS LAB 51 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">122</a>;</p>

<p>v. Shall ensure manual integration of peaks is only undertaken as allowed by an in-house policy, which is scientifically justified and applied consistently through a batch; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:180" rel="footnote">[footnote 180]</a></sup></p>

<p>vi. Shall ensure manual integration of peaks is recorded and justified; and</p>

<p>vii. Where manual integration has been used on a case sample and this has caused the result to be reported as over the legal limit, where this would not have happened without the use of manual integration, this must be made clear when the results are reported.</p>

<p>f. For any part of the analysis employing a mass spectroscopic method the forensic unit shall have a policy on the acceptable ion ratios in calibrators, QC and case samples.</p>

<p>i. This policy should, subject to the point below, be based on the guidelines <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">123</a> issued by World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</p>

<p>ii. The forensic unit may have an in-house policy setting out the acceptable results for peaks above the ULOQ which deviates from the WADA guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">123</a>.</p>

<p>g. Subject to 103.2.24 below, a blank human blood sample (which is analysed through the whole extraction alongside case work) must be run on each analytical batch. For each drug being analysed the concentration must be less than the LOD. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:181" rel="footnote">[footnote 181]</a></sup></p>

<p>h. The method shall involve monitoring for analytical results which suggest there may have been a contamination event (e.g. the presence of cocaine without BZE or drugs appearing where not expected).</p>

<p>i. The reported result of the method <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:182" rel="footnote">[footnote 182]</a></sup> shall be the mean of the analysis of at least two aliquots from the sample. There shall be at least two results generated from separate extraction (i.e. the extraction of at least two aliquots) and analysis of aliquots taken from the sample. This requirement applies to case samples and those QC samples at the relevant legal limits.</p>

<p>j. For the mean of a number of analytical results to be acceptable all of the analytical results (i.e. drug concentrations in any case sample, calibrator or QC) shall be in the range ±20% of the mean. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:183" rel="footnote">[footnote 183]</a></sup> Forensic units may adopt alternative approaches so long as they do not allow a greater difference from the mean.</p>

<p>k. For each drug the analytical method shall achieve the following.</p>

<p>i. It shall have a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at a concentration equal to or lower than half of the legal limit.</p>

<p>ii. It shall, subject to point iii immediately below, have an upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) at a concentration at least 25% higher than the Common Reporting Threshold (CRT) (see below).</p>

<p>iii. For Diazepam, Flunitrazepam, Lorazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam (where the sample and QCs may require dilution to bring them within the calibration range) the forensic unit shall have a ULOQ appropriate to the method used.</p>

<p>iv. It shall use data points for calibration which ensure the calibration curve is optimised over the range of interest (that being from the LLOQ to the ULOQ).</p>

<p>v. The acceptable range of recovery of the internal standard shall be determined. During the validation of the method the forensic unit shall determine the range of recovery of the internal standard (as applied on a batch basis) over which the method is reliable and, in particular, over which the uncertainty of measurement requirements in this document can be achieved.</p>

<p>vi. It shall have a relative bias (the correct term may be trueness but the term bias is routinely used in the field) of less than 20%. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:184" rel="footnote">[footnote 184]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:185" rel="footnote">[footnote 185]</a></sup></p>

<p>vii. It shall have the bias monitored on a regular basis (that being at least every three months).</p>

<p>viii. The method shall, subject to 103.2.10, ensure the correction of any positive bias, but negative bias shall not be corrected. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:186" rel="footnote">[footnote 186]</a></sup></p>

<p>l. The forensic unit shall be able to achieve the uncertainty of measurement requirements set out in 103.3.19 and 103.3.22 below. These requirements shall be maintained in routine work.</p>

<p>103.2.9 The forensic unit shall, for each drug, establish the uncertainty of measurement in a manner consistent with accepted guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">39</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">124</a> and accounting for all variables which may affect the results (e.g. different operators, analysis in different batches, analysis on different dates).</p>

<p>103.2.10 If a forensic unit has an uncertainty of measurement which is lower than the Forensic Science Regulator Expanded Uncertainty (FSREU) and the correction for bias and deduction of the forensic unit’s uncertainty of measurement would lead to a ‘Not Less than Figure’ (NLTF) equal to or higher than that created by deducting the FSREU there shall be no correction for bias.</p>

<h4>Positive Quality Control</h4>

<p>103.2.11 The forensic unit shall undertake ongoing quality control monitoring using, subject to 103.2.24 below, human blood spiked at the critical drug driving limits for each drug. The results shall be trended in an appropriate manner (which is a Shewhart Chart) and subjected to suitable statistical rules (e.g. the Westgard Rules <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">125</a>) for action. Results shall only be reported as valid if obtained while the method is under control.</p>

<p>103.2.12 The quality control monitoring shall use sufficient QC samples, at suitable concentrations, in each batch to ensure the reliability of results can be assured. Forensic units should use a level of QC samples of at least 5% of the samples in the batch.</p>

<p>103.2.13 To be considered reliable each casework must be ‘bracketed’ by acceptable QC results. To be acceptable the QC samples before and after the sample (with concentrations above and below the analytical results for the case sample – where these exist) are valid.</p>

<p>103.2.14 The quality control matrix will, subject to 103.2.24 below, use human blood. The drugs will be spiked into this matrix at the legal limits for each drug.</p>

<p>103.2.15 The quality control data shall be plotted on a Shewhart chart with statistically derived control limits. The standard deviation or standard deviation of the mean used for the control lines will be derived from statistical analysis of QC data (a minimum of 20 data points, excluding outliers) for set up of preliminary quality control chart limit monitoring purposes.</p>

<p>103.2.16 The control lines for the warning limits shall be derived using the mean of the QC data and:</p>

<p>a. Where the QC results are plotted as individual analytical results; ±2 standard deviations of the forensic unit’s method; or</p>

<p>b. Where the QC results are plotted as the mean of analytical results ±2 standard deviations of the mean of the forensic unit’s method.</p>

<p>103.2.17 The control lines for the action limit shall be derived from the mean of the QC data and:</p>

<p>a. Where the QC results are plotted as individual analytical results; ±3 standard deviations of the forensic unit’s method; or</p>

<p>b. Where the QC results are plotted as the mean of analytical results; ±3 standard deviations of the mean of the forensic unit’s method.</p>

<p>103.2.18 An appropriate investigation, the nature of which is to be determined by the forensic unit, shall be carried out and corrective action taken, where relevant, when any 1 point exceeds the action limit.</p>

<p>103.2.19 An appropriate investigation, the nature of which is to be determined by the forensic unit, shall be carried out (or comment made on the case file if not detrimental to the CJS) and corrective action taken when 2 consecutive points are between the warning and the action limits.</p>

<p>103.2.20 The forensic unit shall establish rules for the monitoring of trends in the QC data (for example, an appropriate investigation to be carried out when 9 consecutive points fall on one side of the mean, 6 consecutive increasing points, or 6 consecutive decreasing points).</p>

<p>103.2.21 The forensic unit shall review the QC data and re-establish the mean, warning, and action limits from the QC data once 60 data points have been obtained to set up initial limits.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:187" rel="footnote">[footnote 187]</a></sup> The data on the charts shall be reviewed thereafter at intervals of no more than three months and the data on the charts statistically compared to that data used to establish these initial limits. Where there is a statistically significant difference,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:188" rel="footnote">[footnote 188]</a></sup> or other reason such as a new QC standard being used or the instrument requiring cleaning (other than as part of routine calibration and maintenance), between the latest set of QC data and the initial set of data, the limits shall be reset. The new values shall apply only to analyses after resetting of the values.</p>

<p>103.2.22 Where the monitoring indicates the laboratory is no longer complying with the requirements in relation to uncertainty (see 103.2.8) work shall stop. A non-conforming work investigation shall be carried out and corrective action shall be taken to return the method to control.</p>

<p>103.2.23 Where a new lot of a certified reference material (CRM) is introduced, it shall be compared, by experiment, against the existing CRM to determine whether there might be a change in the operation of the method.</p>

<h4>Human Blood</h4>

<p>103.2.24 The requirements in the section above requiring the use of human blood shall not apply where:</p>

<p>a. There are exceptional circumstances making the use of human blood impractical;</p>

<p>b. The method involving the use of non-human blood is fully validated; and</p>

<p>c. UKAS has accepted that the method using non-human blood is acceptable.</p>

<p>103.2.25 The use of non-human blood shall only continue for so long as the exceptional circumstances require it.</p>

<h4>Contamination</h4>

<p>103.2.0 Analysis for the purpose of s5A <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">92</a> can involve detection and quantification of low concentrations of drugs. Further, even low levels of contamination could have an impact on a case.</p>

<p>103.2.1 Forensic units shall monitor for potential contamination events. Examples include, but are not limited to, drugs appearing in blanks, drugs appearing in calibrators or reference material which should not include them and unlikely results such as the presence of cocaine without its metabolite BZE.</p>

<p>103.2.2 Any contamination event shall be treated as non-conforming work and there shall be an appropriate investigation and action.</p>

<p>103.2.3 Forensic units shall address the potential for sporadic contamination <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:189" rel="footnote">[footnote 189]</a></sup> events in the reported results (see section 103.3.13 et seq below).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">103.3 </span> Reporting of Results</h3>

<h4>Units</h4>

<p>103.3.1 Results shall be reported in units of micrograms per litre to facilitate comparison against the legal limits and avoid any confusion. Results for drugs with a legal limit below 10 μg/L shall be reported to one decimal place. Results for a drug with a legal limit equal to, or greater than, 10 μg/L shall be reported to integer values only.</p>

<h4>Calculation</h4>

<p>103.3.2 Where analytical results include a value above the ULOQ the mean shall be calculated using (a) the analytical result which is below the ULOQ and the ULOQ for the result which is above the ULOQ. The actual figure may not represent the true mean, but the NLTF figure derived from it is still worthwhile. It is acceptable to note that the mean is less than the true mean as a result of the use of the ULOQ.</p>

<p>103.3.3 Where both analytical results are above the ULOQ the mean shall be reported as above the ULOQ. The ULOQ shall be used for the calculation of the NLTF.</p>

<p>103.3.4 Where analytical results include a value below the LLOQ and above the LOD the value should be reported as too low to report a meaningful concentration. The forensic unit shall determine a form of words to use in such cases.</p>

<p>103.3.5 The result shall be reported by use of a NLTF unless all results are above the ULOQ. The NLTF shall be calculated as follows. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:190" rel="footnote">[footnote 190]</a></sup></p>

<p>103.3.6 The FSREU shall be deducted from the mean of the analytical results. The figure generated shall be rounded down to the number of decimal places noted above. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:191" rel="footnote">[footnote 191]</a></sup></p>

<p>103.3.7 To illustrate, consider an example of a sample with concentrations of amphetamine in replicate one of 315 µg/L and replicate two of 323 µg/L leading to a mean of 319. µg/L. The FSREU is 20% so the deduction would be 63.8 producing 255.2 µg/L. This would be rounded down to 255 µg/L.</p>

<p>103.3.8 Where both results are above the ULOQ the normal reporting calculation as detailed above shall be carried out, but the figure should be reported as ‘greater than ###’. For example, if the ULOQ for BZE is 250 µg/L, and both analytical results exceed this figure, 20% should be deducted from 250, and the result reported as’ greater than 200 µg/L’.</p>

<p>103.3.9 The results shall be interpreted on the basis that the figure as rounded is the relevant figure for comparison against the legal limit.</p>

<h4>Limits</h4>

<p>103.3.10 Where the analytical results are all below the LOD the result may be reported as no drug detected.</p>

<p>103.3.11 Where the drug is detected but the NLTF is equal to or less than the legal limit for the drug the results may be reported as the drug present, but it cannot be reported as being over the limit.</p>

<p>103.3.12 Where the NLTF is above the legal limit the concentration of the drug may be reported as above the legal limit. The report may provide both the mean of the analytical results and the NLTF figure or just the NLTF.</p>

<h4>Sporadic Contamination</h4>

<p>103.3.13 This section applies where a forensic unit:</p>

<p>a. Issues a report including a NLTF for any drug which is above the legal limit for that drug; and</p>

<p>b. Has experienced a sporadic contamination event related to the drug being reported with an NLTF above the relevant legal limit.</p>

<p>103.3.14 In the circumstances set out in paragraph 103.3.13, the highest concentration attributed to sporadic contamination in that forensic unit for the drug of interest shall be provided in the report.</p>

<p>103.3.15 In this section the term report includes a SFR1.</p>

<h4>Analysis at the Instruction of Police or Prosecution</h4>

<p>103.3.16 To justify a prosecution the results of the method shall allow the scientist to state those results support the proposition that the concentration of the drug was above the legal limit. To assess the extent to which the results of the method support the proposition the uncertainty of measurement shall be accounted for.</p>

<p>103.3.17 Without a standard approach established centrally there could be variability in how measurement uncertainty is accounted for in forensic units leading to the potential for different outcomes from analysis of the same sample by different laboratories. That could lead to the decision to prosecute being determined by which forensic unit performed the analysis.</p>

<p>103.3.18 The use of the FSREU gives rise to the concept of a Common Reporting Threshold (CRT) - the lowest measured concentration at which the result can be reported as being above the legal limit. The CRT for each drug is also given in Annex A. A forensic unit will only report a result as above the legal limit when the reported result of the method is greater than or equal to the CRT for the relevant drug.</p>

<p>103.3.19 The forensic unit shall only provide a figure, which will be the “not less than” figure referred to above, if its expanded uncertainty of measurement is equal to or less than the FSREU.</p>

<p>103.3.20 This document covers the process by which the analytical result is produced and a conclusion reported as to whether the concentration of the drug in the sample was above the relevant legal limit. The use of an agreed uncertainty and resultant common minimum reporting threshold does raise some additional points.</p>

<p>a. Any report/statement on an analysis shall make clear:</p>

<p>i. That the determination of the “not less than” figure used centrally set expanded uncertainty; and</p>

<p>ii. The forensic unit’s calculated uncertainty for the analysis was no greater (worse) than the FSREU.</p>

<p>b. The requirements in paragraph a above can be achieved by reference to this document being complied with.</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>

<p>103.3.21 The use of the FSREU for the determination of the “not less than” figure provides a consistent approach to the CJS. However, any consideration of the reliability of the results (e.g. in response to a challenge) should address the issue of the probability of the analytical results being obtained had the sample been on the legal limit. This should be on the basis of the forensic unit’s true uncertainty of measurement. Otherwise, the CJS will not be provided with an accurate description of the robustness of the evidence.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:192" rel="footnote">[footnote 192]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Analysis at the Instruction of the Defence</h4>

<p>103.3.22 The need for consistency in decisions to prosecute, which led to the adoption of the CRT, does not apply to those forensic units instructed by the defence. However, there is a requirement of the CJS for the work undertaken on behalf of the defence to be to appropriate quality standards. Therefore, those instructed by the defence shall comply with this document.</p>

<p>103.3.23 It is clear that forensic units acting at the instruction of the defence using methods with high uncertainty of measurement could have an adverse impact on the CJS (e.g. by providing inaccurate or misleading results). The forensic units expanded uncertainty at the 99.7% coverage probability (as determined in compliance with 103.2.5) shall be less that the FSREU.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">104.1 </span> Technical Records</h3>

<p>104.1.1 The forensic unit shall carry out policies and procedures, appropriate to the device and/or scope of the planned activity, which incorporate:</p>

<p>a. Keeping a record of the state, mode and physical condition of any seized device and any potentially relevant information; and</p>

<p>b. Labelling the components of the device and taking photographs (screen, computer front and back, and the area around the device to be seized) and/or sketching the device’s connections and surrounding area where relevant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">104.2 </span> Test Methods</h3>

<h4>Selection of Methods</h4>

<p>104.2.1 A method is a logical sequence of operations or analysis which may include the use of software, hardware, tools, and actions by the practitioner.</p>

<p>104.2.2 The forensic unit shall take account of the need for backup and redundancy when working on cases, to ensure that a single technical failure (e.g. a power loss or disk corruption) will not result in the loss of data on working copies (30 - Control of Data).</p>

<p>104.2.3 Software, hardware, and tools, where operation of these has an impact in obtaining results will require validation within the method they are deployed, or any existing validation to be verified, as laid out in 104.3.7.</p>

<p>104.2.4 The forensic unit shall ensure that, for the range of the digital forensics methods it uses, the validation requirements take account of staff competency levels, the nature and difficulty of the tasks to be carried out, and the level of acceptability of the method in the wider forensic science and criminal justice community.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">104.3 </span> Validation of Methods</h3>

<h4>Risk Assessment of a Method</h4>

<p>104.3.1 The risk assessment process detailed in this Code is intended to be used to determine the impact of the overall method used. It is important to look at how a method or tool is to be used. For instance, when imaging storage media, the risks may include:</p>

<p>a. Altering data stored on the evidential item;</p>

<p>b. Returning incomplete and/or inaccurate data; or</p>

<p>c. Incorrectly determining the media to be unreadable.</p>

<p>104.3.2 In certain parts of the process, the competent use of a suite of software tools or the use of visual/manual checks could be demonstrated to mitigate the identified risks in the method. Proper consideration of the nature of risks at this stage should feed into the development of a method as well as into the validation strategy.</p>

<p>104.3.3 The development of the method for the given forensic science activity and the subsequent validation shall set out how the identified risks are being addressed and how the effectiveness of the method will be tested along with the end-user requirements and specification.</p>

<p>104.3.4 A formal risk assessment method should be used. There are various risk assessment methods that may be chosen, one which may be suitable is called failure modes and effects analysis <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">33</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">71</a>. Failure modes and effects analysis is a step-by-step approach for analysing each stage of a method looking for potential weakness that might result in a failure of some sort, with consideration of if the failure were to occur, would it be detected without causing harm e.g. an erroneous result being picked up by a quality control.</p>

<p>104.3.5 Whichever risk assessment method is used, inclusion of cross referencing between the stage in the procedure and the risk assessment table, and identifying what controls are to be assessed during validation ensures the testing is focussed. It also provides documentation to support the requirements set out in in 104.3.3.</p>

<h4>Validation of Measurement-Based Methods</h4>

<p>104.3.6 This Code describes validation for measurement and interpretive methods. For the purposes of digital forensics, the section referring to measurement-based methods is applicable for most methods employed. This includes methods where direct measurements are not made, such as extraction processes using automated tools or manual methods for the purpose of providing data.</p>

<h4>Verification of the Validation of Adopted Methods</h4>

<p>104.3.7 In most cases adopted methods or software tools and scripts should follow a tailored process for the validation of measurement-based methods. However, an adopted method would normally be expected to be already well supported through documentation, available validation studies, testing-house studies or published papers. In this case this Code requires confirmation of the applicability of the validation against the required end-user requirement and specification and a documented demonstration that a method works within acceptable performance parameters.</p>

<p>104.3.8 There is a requirement in this Code for the production of an available library of documents relevant to the authorisation of a method and the production of a certificate of validation completion.</p>

<p>104.3.9 The final requirement in this Code is to demonstrate that a method works in the hands of the intended users.</p>

<h4>Verification of Minor Changes in Methods</h4>

<p>104.3.10 Methods are validated to a specific configuration; therefore any changes in any of the constituent parts (hardware, firmware, script, operating system, etc.) may affect its overall operation and any dependant systems, which could invalidate the results.</p>

<p>104.3.11 Any proposed change shall be risk assessed at the method level as even a patch in a software tool may adversely affect the operation of a second tool or process using its output, e.g. giving a plausible but incorrect date stamp. Other examples include a tool inadvertently becoming write-enabled through a firmware update.</p>

<h4>Implementation Plan and Any Constraints</h4>

<p>104.3.12 The implementation plan is required to include monitoring of controls and communication that in the digital forensic sciences shall include configuration management, dependencies, how identified software/firmware/hardware bugs are to be handled and how patches, etc. are to be controlled.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">104.4 </span> Handling of Test Items</h3>

<h4>Exhibit Handling, Protection and Storage</h4>

<p>104.4.1 The forensic unit shall consider whether the value of any other type of evidence (e.g. fingerprints) that may be present could be compromised during the capture, preservation and investigation of the digital evidence.</p>

<p>104.4.2 The forensic unit shall ensure that devices containing potential digital evidence are packaged, sealed, and transported in such a way as to protect the integrity of the digital evidence.</p>

<p>104.4.3 There are two main issues to consider in the transporting of digital evidence:</p>

<p>104.4.4 The security of the device and digital evidence to ensure that access to it is correctly supervised when moving it from the scene to the laboratory or other location; and</p>

<p>104.4.5 Protection of the device and digital evidence to ensure that it is not affected by physical shock, electromagnetic interference, extremes of heat and humidity or other environmental hazard.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">105. </span> Video Analysis</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.1 </span> Scope</h3>

<p>105.1.1 This appendix covers all forensic units conducting the FSA. This includes practitioners, technical staff, police staff or police officers conducting the FSA, even if this is not their primary role. It is therefore not limited to activity in a video or imaging unit by specialists.</p>

<p>105.1.2 The previous regulatory framework <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">4</a> required accreditation for all specialist activity, however included a limited exemption for the recovery of CCTV footage from a working CCTV system in situ and CCTV replay for viewing with no further analysis by competent staff using methods approved by the organisation</p>

<p>105.1.3 This Code maintains this route for non-specialist front-line staff to continue to recover footage using the manufacturers intended method of recovery from CCTV systems rather than specialist tools. It also allows for limited processing allowing presentation by the individual of the footage as a clip in a factual report. This dispensation of processing is not aimed at video specialists, it is intended for investigating officers to be able to exhibit material viewed without requiring recourse back to video specialists unless further analysis is required.</p>

<p>105.1.4 FSA 98 Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/Video Surveillance systems (VSS) sets out the sub-activities and stipulate the controls that shall be in place to apply the exemption, namely:</p>

<p>a. The organisation’s forensic unit has approved processes, methods and tools to be used in this forensic science activity using the following:</p>

<p>i. NPCC Framework for Video Based Evidence <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">104</a>;</p>

<p>ii. Dstl - Digital Imaging and Multimedia Procedure <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">126</a>;</p>

<p>iii. Dstl - Recovery and Acquisition of Video Evidence <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">105</a>; and</p>

<p>iv. This appendix.</p>

<p>b. The forensic unit (or wider organisation) records and maintain competence of staff it authorises to conduct the above work.</p>

<p>c. Practitioners adhere to the standards of conduct in this Code and the procedures are in this appendix.</p>

<p>105.1.5 Where the data acquisition goes beyond using the manufacturer of the CCTV system in question’s intended method, or the processing of the data requires specialist processing, (see section 80, FSA Definition – Specialist Video Multimedia, Recovery, Processing and Analysis, for specific detail) which requires accreditation the Code, which includes adherence to this appendix. This appendix includes activities which exceed activities in section 79 - FSA Definition – Recovery and Processing of Footage from CCTV/VSS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.2 </span> Personnel</h3>

<h4>Competence</h4>

<p>105.2.1 All personnel who perform FSAs or sub-activities shall be competent in those activities they perform and records of that competence shall be held. Where the forensic unit holds accreditation, and/or is required to hold accreditation the competence framework shall be suitable for that purpose and comply with this Code in full.</p>

<p>105.2.2 All the FSAs in this Code contain sub-activities which have different requirements in terms of knowledge, training, and experience to be considered competent. The sub-activities under the Section 79 Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/Video Surveillance systems (VSS) require those authorising police staff to retrieve data by setting out the expected training and competence for the levels of activity expected. The dispensation requires the organisation to have a procedure to authorise and re-authorise staff and a procedure to approve methods. This procedure for approving methods should be overseen by practitioners from the organisation’s own forensic video capability.</p>

<p>105.2.3 The FSA of Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/Video Surveillance systems (VSS) is primarily aimed at permitting specified front-line activity, typically by police staff, therefore the Competency Levels detailed in the NPCC Framework for Video Based Evidence <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">104</a> are applicable in determining the competence requirements.</p>

<p>105.2.4 Any personnel performing an FSA shall have a clear understanding of the overall video forensic process they are permitted to conduct, and be mindful of the objectives of all operations they perform. Procedures issued for use under FSA Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/Video Surveillance systems (VSS) should have been formulated to achieve a desired task without unnecessary transformations, those conducting FSA Specialist Video Multimedia, Recovery, Processing and Analysis shall be competent in the formulation of process workflow to correctly achieve a desired task without unnecessary transformations and be able to assess and explain the impact of video transformations at all stages of the process.</p>

<p>105.2.5 Storage media from digital video recorders (DVRs) will often present unknown, proprietary file-systems. These are not recognised or interpreted by common digital forensic hard disk drive interrogation tools. Thus, to avoid misinterpreting a storage medium as containing no CCTV, a practitioner working to the FSA 84 FSA Definition – Specialist Video Multimedia, Recovery, Processing and Analysis shall be competent at recognising the byte-level indicators of the likely presence of video or audio on such storage media.</p>

<p>105.2.6 Statements related to provision of recognition rather than an identification through comparison should be prepared by individuals competent in the application of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) Code D, Code of Practice for The Identification Of Persons By Police Officers <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">106</a>.</p>

<p>105.2.7 All practitioners shall understand the distinction between expert evidence and evidence of fact.</p>

<p>105.2.8 The person proposing to give opinion evidence shall be an expert in all relevant aspects they intend to give an opinion on. Expertise in CCTV, video, imaging, enhancement etc. does not equate to expertise on the content of the image. Unless they are also an expert in the content of the images, imagery experts should not attempt to give expert opinion evidence on the meaning of a comparison between the objects in question <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">105</a>.</p>

<p>105.2.9 Image analysis requires specific subject matter expertise of both the system and the subject to be analysed. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:193" rel="footnote">[footnote 193]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.3 </span> Selection of Methods</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>105.3.1 Forensic units conducting either FSA shall have processes and procedures which are fit for purpose issued under the authority of the SAI. Methods under either FSA where further analysis is expected or accreditation is required shall be validated in line with this Code.</p>

<p>105.3.2 Procedures for FSA Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/Video Surveillance systems (VSS) should be developed and/or overseen by practitioners from the organisation’s forensic video unit.</p>

<h4>Video Transformations</h4>

<p>105.3.3 Where a forensic unit undertakes the transformation of video material, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:194" rel="footnote">[footnote 194]</a></sup> the transformations shall be appropriate for the intended use of the transformed material and shall be documented. Procedures issued for use under FSA 83 Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/Video Surveillance Systems (VSS) should have been formulated to achieve a desired task without unnecessary transformations.</p>

<p>105.3.4 Workflows using Digital Evidence Management Systems (DEMS) are prone to automatically processing and transforming video material in ways invisible to the operator. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">105</a> Forensic units should ensure that DEMS are only used in a manner that has been approved as suitable by the SAI.</p>

<p>105.3.5 Often video material received by a forensic unit will already have undergone transformations such as spatial and temporal sampling, digitisation, transcoding and compression. The effect of those transformations shall be taken into account in all subsequent processing and interpretation.</p>

<h4>Analogue Video</h4>

<p>105.3.6 Where analogue video is to be digitised, the conversion should take place as soon as possible in the process once it has been identified that the footage may be of interest (typically after initial viewing).</p>

<p>105.3.7 As with all transformations, where digitisation is performed it needs to be done so as to minimise any loss of information that may be relevant to the investigation. Equally, any decision not to digitise shall take into account the risks of degradation to the analogue medium and the rationale shall be documented.</p>

<p>105.3.8 Appropriate hardware is required to extract the maximum amount of information in terms of image quality, audio tracks and associated metadata. Any departures from this shall be justified and documented.</p>

<h4>Enhancement</h4>

<p>105.3.9 Forensic units shall be clear on the purpose of any image enhancement that is to be carried out and anticipate any data losses that may occur as a side effect. Personnel performing enhancement shall be competent to apply and explain the any enhancements selected, and therefore the activity exceeds the basic brightness and contrast adjustment to entire image permitted under the FSA 79 Recovery and Processing of footage from CCTV/VSS.</p>

<p>105.3.10 Images enhanced for one purpose shall not be used for another purpose without fully reconsidering the appropriateness and the risks.</p>

<p>105.3.11 In forensic applications, enhancements should not generally be applied to selective portions of an image unless these regions and the enhancements within them are clearly identified. However, it is permissible to enhance the whole of a cropped image, again with the enhancement/transformations detailed.</p>

<p>105.3.12 It is important that recipients of enhanced images (e.g. investigators, experts or jury members) are not misled in any way. To this end, care shall be taken to ensure that enhanced images are uniquely identified as such and that sufficient information on the performed enhancement is available in the case-notes.</p>

<h4>Tracking in Footage</h4>

<p>105.3.13 The methodology for tracking (e.g. highlighting or circling) objects or people (either manually or automatically) through recorded footage shall be documented with risks identified and mitigated.</p>

<p>105.3.14 The methodology for redaction (e.g. masking, blurring or pixelating) objects or people (either manually or automatically) through recorded footage shall be documented with the risks identified and mitigated. This is applicable for tracking and redaction whether using specialist standalone tools, or if the SAI has approved, when using a DEMS system for this purpose.</p>

<h4>Image Comparison</h4>

<p>105.3.15 Forensic units that undertake image comparison shall do the following.</p>

<p>a. Use valid methods. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:195" rel="footnote">[footnote 195]</a></sup></p>

<p>b. Recognise that image comparison is a form of opinion evidence <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">127</a> and is admissible where the judge and jury require the assistance of evidence which depends on the application of specialist skill or knowledge in the field that is under comparison (i.e. are experts) <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">105</a>.</p>

<p>c. Demonstrate the appropriate competence in relation to the image-based processes <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:196" rel="footnote">[footnote 196]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:197" rel="footnote">[footnote 197]</a></sup> that have been undertaken in addition to demonstrating competence in comparison of the type of material being compared in an image.</p>

<p>d. To reduce the risk of confirmation bias<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:198" rel="footnote">[footnote 198]</a></sup> , incident footage containing unknown persons or objects of interest shall be analysed to identify distinguishing features before known footage of the suspect objects of interest is viewed or information revealed to the analyst expected to form an opinion as to the activity, identity or perform any comparison. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:199" rel="footnote">[footnote 199]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:200" rel="footnote">[footnote 200]</a></sup></p>

<p>e. Ensure that all relevant information in relation to image processing undertaken by a third party is communicated to the person undertaking the comparison. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:201" rel="footnote">[footnote 201]</a></sup></p>

<p>f. Demonstrate the decision process and basis for critical findings.</p>

<p>g. Demonstrate that the methods used for comparison are appropriate, through validation, for the image characteristics of the case material. For example, methods developed for high quality recordings may not be valid for low quality CCTV images. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:202" rel="footnote">[footnote 202]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.4 </span> Validation of Methods</h3>

<h4>Data Recovery</h4>

<p>105.4.1 The procedure for recovery of CCTV footage from digital CCTV system in situ by using the manufacturer of the system CCTV system manufacturers intended method, should be fit-for-purpose. This procedure should be fit-for-purpose for the type of personnel permitted to use it; where non-specialists are the intended users the procedure should contain steps to direct users when the procedure is applicable and also when to cease/not-start a recovery and seek specialist assistance.</p>

<p>105.4.2 When video data are not readily accessible by standard/manufacturers’ methods (e.g. due to technical difficulties) it may be necessary to recover these video data in the facility by a process akin to reverse engineering or by using third-party tools. When undertaking this casework the method shall be subject to validation in line with the Code noting especially the following.</p>

<p>a. Not all video material will necessarily be recovered.</p>

<p>b. Data might be incorrectly interpreted (e.g. time and date stamps).</p>

<h4>Image Comparison</h4>

<p>105.4.3 All methods designed for image comparison require validation, where the comparison uses proportional relationships and/or metrics the validation shall include an appropriate, robust and repeatable method for quantifying the associated uncertainties (see 105.5.4 Photo/Videogrammetry).</p>

<p>105.4.4 Forensic units shall review the scientific literature to identify the following.</p>

<p>a. The scientific basis for the method.</p>

<p>b. Studies critical of the method.</p>

<p>c. Examples of testing methodologies.</p>

<p>d. End-user requirements to be included in the validation, including avoiding any biasing effect of the observer (including juror).</p>

<p>e. Reproducibility of finding (including any verbal confidence scale).</p>

<p>f. False inclusion/exclusion rates.</p>

<p>105.4.5 Image comparison methods which are cited in the scientific literature as unreliable or biased should not be used unless comparable research and validation indicates the issues identified are now controlled. Irrespective of the findings of any such study, the fact that the method was criticised remains disclosable and should be addressed in the statement/report, with the remedial actions that address the issues.</p>

<h4>Reliability of Manufacturers’ Players</h4>

<p>105.4.6 In many instances practitioners will have no option but to utilise proprietary replay software but will not have the practical means of comprehensively validating it. Consideration shall be given to the associated risks and how these may be mitigated in a proportionate manner as required in the Code. For example, the risk mitigation approach may take into account:</p>

<p>a. The context, including what the tool is required to do and how the data will be used;</p>

<p>b. The competence of the practitioner; and</p>

<p>c. How well-established the body of knowledge for the replay tool is within the forensic practitioner community.</p>

<p>105.4.7 The version of software used shall always be included as part of the record. In the absence of this information being available, preservation of one or more screenshot images may provide a basis for identification of the version used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.5 </span> Estimation of Uncertainty</h3>

<p>105.5.1 The Code require that a forensic unit performing testing is required to evaluate measurement uncertainty, even where the test method precludes rigorous evaluation of measurement such as a test that is qualitative in nature.</p>

<p>105.5.2 The impact uncertainty may have on the finding shall be included in both factual and evaluative reports to the CJS where it is relevant.</p>

<p>105.5.3 Only two example methods are included here, all analytical methods are in scope for this requirement (see also 105.6.13).</p>

<h4>Photo/Videogrammetry <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:203" rel="footnote">[footnote 203]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:204" rel="footnote">[footnote 204]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>105.5.4 When extracting dimensional information from imagery, it is essential that there is an appropriate, robust and repeatable method for quantifying the uncertainties associated with any quoted value.</p>

<h4>Derivation of Date/Time/Framing Rate</h4>

<p>105.5.5 In cases where timing information from a video recording is crucial (e.g. speed estimations of vehicles from CCTV), a suitable method for quantifying the uncertainty in such a measurement as well as other factors such as measuring the frame rate shall be employed. This method will take account of the whole recording process (image capture, image encoding, metadata assignment, data storage).</p>

<p>105.5.6 The date/time information provided by the multitude of CCTV systems in use is of highly variable quality. The following shall be taken into account where the date/time information may be important.</p>

<p>a. The displayed time may not represent the actual capture time.</p>

<p>b. It is necessary to consider both the precision and the accuracy of any displayed time as apparent precision may not be an indicator of accuracy.</p>

<p>c. The internal/displayed clock may not be accurate or sufficiently precise.</p>

<p>d. There may be more than one displayed clock.</p>

<p>e. The image capture rate may not be fixed so a calculated average framing rate cannot always be applied to a single specific frame interval.</p>

<p>f. The frame rate setting information contained within the system menu will not always be a true reflection of the actual recorded rate.</p>

<p>g. All computer-based systems are prone to hesitation under load, which can introduce unpredictable interruptions in record sequences.</p>

<p>h. What is displayed might not correspond to what is stored. For example, a CCTV system may display an on-screen clock with second precision whereas the data stored on the unit may actually be stamped with millisecond precision.</p>

<p>i. Time stamps might be a network time stamp of when information is received, not when it is digitised.</p>

<p>105.5.7 Techniques such as extended section analysis, analysis of camera sequence order, interrogation of the system menu and independent timing of the system performance may be considered to provide a holistic view of the accuracy of the derived times/rates. Test recordings cannot confirm the accuracy of the recording at the time of an incident, but can be used to provide an estimate of uncertainties provided the assumption is stated that the recording device was operating in the same manner as at the time of recording.</p>

<p>105.5.8 If the method includes analysis of output from variable rate cameras, the validation and estimate of measurement uncertainty shall include this use.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.6 </span> Control of Data</h3>

<h4>Recovery of Data</h4>

<p>105.6.1 The overarching requirement of the control of data procedure is to be able to show that the recovered footage is true to the original video recording, and remains so from the point of recovery; in practice a bit-for-bit copy of the original with a method to show it has not been tampered with. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">128</a> Video footage should be extracted in its native format <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:205" rel="footnote">[footnote 205]</a></sup> in order to maintain image quality and be stored as a master copy <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:206" rel="footnote">[footnote 206]</a></sup> and retained to be available for any future forensic analysis e.g. defence experts.</p>

<h4>Inadvertent Overwriting by Digital/Network Video Recorders</h4>

<p>105.6.2 Due to the proprietary nature and often limited functionality of some digital video recorder (DVR) (or network video recorders) it is necessary to consider and prevent mechanisms that could result in lost or inaccessible data. Consideration shall be given to the following when processing a DVR device.</p>

<p>a. Disconnecting the hard disk drive (HDD) from the main board of the DVR may cause the HDD to be permanently disassociated from this machine, particularly if new disk or clone is then subsequently connected, rendering the video inaccessible by that machine; this should only be performed by a competent individual as part of a validated method.</p>

<p>b. Connecting a HDD write blocker in line with the HDD may result in the HDD being unrecognisable by the DVR.</p>

<p>c. Clone copy HDDs may be unrecognisable by the DVR, and connection of clones may result in the original HDD being unrecognisable by the DVR.</p>

<p>d. DVR units may go into auto-record mode when switched on – even if no video source is connected.</p>

<p>e. Some DVR units are equipped with timed expiry (refer to Glossary). This can result in data being marked as ‘deleted’ even if the machine is switched off.</p>

<p>105.6.3 Due to the risks above, data recovery from the DVR once no longer in the original working system is a specialist activity covered by Section 80 - FSA Definition – Specialist Video Multimedia, Recovery, Processing and Analysis.</p>

<h4>Creation of a Master and Working Copies</h4>

<p>105.6.4 A master exhibit of the source/original data shall be preserved, the forensic unit should define in the procedure what constitutes a master. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:207" rel="footnote">[footnote 207]</a></sup></p>

<p>105.6.5 Working copies of the video footage may be produced and these will typically be either:</p>

<p>a. A bit for bit copy of the master in its native format, suitable for further analysis by specialists instructed by either the prosecution or the defence;</p>

<p>b. A bit for bit copy of the master in its native format, supplied with a player suitable for investigating officers to view the footage; or</p>

<p>c. A “playable” format suitable for investigating officers to view the footage and potentially for supplying to the CPS marking this as “Converted Format” and therefore no longer a true copy of the original.</p>

<p>105.6.6 Any media produced whereby original data has been converted to a different format should be clearly marked as “Converted Format”, or identifiable as such in some other way defined in the procedure.</p>

<h4>Conversion from proprietary to generic video format</h4>

<p>105.6.7 Video material from CCTV sources often does not conform to the constraints of broadcast video. Transforming video from CCTV sources into video often requires spatial and temporal re-sampling, which leads to a loss of information that may be important in subsequent processing and interpretation. Therefore, any media produced whereby original data has been converted to a different format should be conspicuously marked or uniquely identifiable as such in some other way defined in the procedure (see section 105.6.4 - Creation of a Master and Working Copies).</p>

<h4>Wifi Enabled Courts</h4>

<p>105.6.8 Court Wifi systems intended for displaying material such as static images and documents may be considered adequate for the majority of cases. However, caution should be exercised when using wireless presentation systems for displaying video material, particularly in cases where there is lots of movement or high-resolution footage. In such cases, there is a risk of lost frames, jitter, or loss of resolution. If replay through wireless systems is identified as inadequate, provision of appropriate playback equipment in court should be sought; if these arrangements are not already in place the forensic unit should discuss this with the instructing authority. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:208" rel="footnote">[footnote 208]</a></sup></p>

<p>105.6.9 The forensic unit should ensure that any material produced that would not be suitable for display via a wireless presentation system is conspicuously marked as such.</p>

<h4>Computers and Automated Equipment</h4>

<h4>Export of Video and Stills from CCTV Players</h4>

<p>105.6.10 Many CCTV players perform a conversion to a broadcast video format either implicitly during playback or explicitly during video export; export should be in native format where it is an available option and this native format is what should be used to create the master copy. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:209" rel="footnote">[footnote 209]</a></sup></p>

<p>105.6.11 Many CCTV players will distort the original recorded material by light, colour, shape and size. They may also not display all frames, or playback recorded audio. They may also detail a timecode and frame rate that is calculated during playback and may not be frame accurate. Any use of a player, either in review, or to achieve a task should be considered and tested. They also commonly re-sample and transcode images when exporting still images. The nature of the transformations introduced by tools used for exporting video and stills from CCTV shall be assessed so that their impact on the subsequent use of the transformed material can be determined.</p>

<p>105.6.12 Replay Software Digital CCTV systems often have an export function so that video footage can be backed up to removal media (e.g. CCTV, Universal Serial Bus hard disk). Proprietary replay software that has been developed and distributed by the system’s manufacturer may generally be initially treated as reliable, as forensic units do not have access to the coding in order to verify its implementation. However, if conducting further analysis other than viewing, the examiners shall assure themselves that the software is working correctly on this workstation and investigate further using other replay software if there are any signs of replay issues (e.g. dropping frames, rescaling issues, wrong proportions) that may affect such analysis. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:210" rel="footnote">[footnote 210]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Analytics and Tools</h4>

<p>105.6.13 The declared performance, in terms of probability detection (PD) and false alarm rates (FAR), of video content analysis tools is dependent on the quality of the video to be analysed. When using video analytic tools for post-event analysis, the forensic unit shall be aware of the impact of video quality on performance. Video analysis tools shall be validated as part of the method they are deployed in, the risk analysis of the actual PD and FAR on the required task shall be undertaken as part of that validation and communicated to the customer.</p>

<p>105.6.14 Video content analytics tools can include any or all of the following:</p>

<p>a. Motion detection</p>

<p>b. Object or person detection</p>

<p>c. Tracking/reidentification</p>

<p>d. Auto redaction</p>

<p>e. Crowd dynamics</p>

<p>f. Behaviour analytics</p>

<h4>Authenticity</h4>

<p>105.6.15 Video material is often received from uncontrolled sources, therefore this can raise questions regarding its authenticity. Forensic units may be required to carry out authenticity analysis to examine the provenance, or integrity. This authenticity analysis can be carried out either with the use of specialist software tools and a practitioner or as a purely human examination process. However, the use of authenticity tools incorporated into DEMS and their output should only be used as an aid to an investigation for intelligence purposes, statements on authenticity would be expected to be expert opinion.</p>

<p>105.6.16 Authentication can include looking for evidence of:</p>

<p>a. Image content manipulation;</p>

<p>b. Deep fakes;</p>

<p>c. Recordings purporting to be from a different date and time;</p>

<p>d. Association to a particular recording device;</p>

<p>e. Editing to remove pertinent content; and</p>

<p>f. Editing to add pertinent content.</p>

<p>105.6.17 Software may be deployed by an organisation to automatically scan multimedia content at the point of submission or ingestion into an organisations system. These tools shall only be used to give an indication that an asset may require further specialist authenticity analysis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">105.7 </span> Statements, Reports and the Presentation of Evidence</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>105.7.1 Guidance setting out the legal requirements for non-expert technical statements <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">71</a> and expert reports <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">70</a> has been issued by the Regulator. Compliance or non-compliance <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:211" rel="footnote">[footnote 211]</a></sup>, with the Code shall be disclosed in statements/reports from all practitioners.</p>

<h4>Statements and Reports</h4>

<p>105.7.2 Practitioners shall understand the distinction between expert evidence and evidence of fact and be aware of the relevant legal requirements in preparing statements or reports.</p>

<h4>Displaying Images</h4>

<p>105.7.3 In cases where the detail of an image or the colour of an item is important, (e.g. in court), the optimised set up of viewing screens, prints and other presentation media shall be considered in conjunction with the use of high-quality originals.</p>

<p>105.7.4 Care shall be taken to ensure that recipients of enhanced images (e.g. investigators, experts or jury members) are given sufficient information so as not to be misled.</p>

<h4>Interpretation</h4>

<p>105.7.5 All imagery viewing requires a degree of interpretation. This may be considered as expert opinion where all reasoning and justification shall be explicitly noted in reports, or where performed under PACE Code D, for factual reporting which also specifies declarations to support the trier of fact is assessing.</p>

<h4>Multiple Evidential Approaches</h4>

<p>105.7.6 Where the expert has undertaken several forms of analysis (e.g. height analysis and the comparison of physical features) the report shall make clear the opinions and conclusions reached by the expert in relation to each of these individually. The expert may then provide an overall opinion and conclusion.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">106. </span> Geolocation - Cell Site Analysis</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.1 </span> Scope</h3>

<p>106.1.1 Cell site analysis relies on:</p>

<p>a. The acquisition of communications data;</p>

<p>b. The processing of those data, often in association with data captured during a radio frequency (RF) propagation survey;</p>

<p>c. The presentation of those data in the form of maps and tables with an expert report.</p>

<p>106.1.2 This appendix covers the forensic unit’s work as applicable to the scope of performing the forensic science activity.</p>

<p>a. Request and/or normalise call data records in order to present call data in the form of maps/tables and produce an investigative report or streamlined forensic report 1 (SFR1)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:212" rel="footnote">[footnote 212]</a></sup> as an expert summary.</p>

<p>b. RF propagation survey to capture the cell sites that serve<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:213" rel="footnote">[footnote 213]</a></sup>/cover a defined area, and WiFi if applicable;</p>

<p>c. Cell site analysis processing of that data and the presentation of an expert report.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.2 </span> Independence, Impartiality and Integrity</h3>

<p>106.2.1 The forensic unit shall ensure that all of its practitioners adhere to this Code in respect of their independence, impartiality and integrity, and that the organisational structure of the forensic unit, policies and procedures support this rather than hinder it.</p>

<p>106.2.2 This Code includes various impartiality requirements, including within the standards of Conduct, for policies and procedures not only to prevent internal and external influence on the results of their examinations and tests, but also cover the corrective action (such as formal disclosure) to be taken if there is a possibility of a practitioner’s judgement having been, or perceived to have been, compromised.</p>

<p>106.2.3 All analyses shall be conducted in an unbiased manner. For example, consideration of both the prosecution and defence hypothesis, if available, or attempting to determine the defence hypothesis.</p>

<p>106.2.4 All forensic units are required to demonstrate that they meet these requirements, which shall include the following.</p>

<p>a. The documentation is compliant with this Code and staff adhere to the documentation.</p>

<p>b. The consideration of one or more alternative hypothesis. In the absence of a stated or obvious defence position (e.g. home address), a null hypothesis (e.g. whether there is data in conflict with the prosecution proposition) may be adopted.</p>

<p>c. The terminology used in reports shall be clearly defined and imply no bias.</p>

<p>i. Phrases in reports such as ‘in the vicinity of’ may only be used if qualified; <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:214" rel="footnote">[footnote 214]</a></sup></p>

<p>ii. Phrases such a ‘consistent with’ should not be used in reports unless all other scenarios the findings would be consistent with are given. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:215" rel="footnote">[footnote 215]</a></sup></p>

<p>d. Cell site analysis may be used to propose investigative avenues (i.e. to help form a hypothesis). If a hypothesis has been produced through a different process, cell site evidence should only be used to test whether that hypothesis is expected by the evidence; it should never be used to test whether the hypothesis supports the allegations or scenarios being put forward in the case independently of the evidence. Care should be taken not to transpose the conditional aspects of any assertion.</p>

<p>e. The use of an independent review of casework including, where appropriate, that this is done independently without prior knowledge of the original outcome.</p>

<p>f. The documentation and review of individual specific case assessments and strategies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.3 </span> Review of Requests, Tenders and/or Contracts</h3>

<p>106.3.1 As part of contract review the forensic unit shall ensure that the commissioning party is made aware of any limitations, false negative rates or caveats that are already known to apply to this type of analysis or service offered by the forensic unit.</p>

<p>106.3.2 For example, analysis of call data records may demonstrate that the phone was within the area covered/served by a specific cell at the time of the beginning and/or end of the call. The customer must be made aware that although locations of interest may be surveyed, pinpointing the phone to a specific location is almost always impossible.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:216" rel="footnote">[footnote 216]</a></sup> Additionally, a location of interest and an alternative location may be so geographically close that the radio survey data obtained at them is the same or substantially similar. In that case the customer shall be informed that there is no reasonable way of inferring at which location the call event was more likely to have occurred.</p>

<p>106.4 Setting Examination Strategy for Geolocation - Cell Site Analysis</p>

<p>106.4.1 This strategy should focus on ensuring request is appropriate, material supports request and there are clear propositions to be addressed and an outline plan/strategy of how the analyst plans to evaluate the proposition. It could include an independent review of the proposed survey strategy or justification for not surveying.</p>

<p>106.4.2 There shall be a procedure defining the setting of forensic strategy. The procedure shall include the following.</p>

<p>a. Dealing with task-relevant<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:217" rel="footnote">[footnote 217]</a></sup> case circumstances.</p>

<p>b. The data available (call data records, cell information, etc.).</p>

<p>c. The limitations of the data. For example, where conclusions are solely or largely based on interpretation of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) billing data, or in situations in which the prosecution and defence scenarios are so similar that cell site techniques will be of little use in attempting to discriminate between them.</p>

<p>d. The suspect’s personal situation (for example, place of work, home address).</p>

<p>e. Known or suspected attribution of phones.</p>

<p>f. Survey requirements:</p>

<p>i. Location survey (including potential requirements for elevation, for example, high floors in tower blocks);</p>

<p>ii. Area survey, to distinguish whether the service between two or more locations can be differentiated; and</p>

<p>iii. Cell mapping, to measure the service area of a given cell where relevant to the case.</p>

<p>g. If the circumstances of the case change or results/information indicate the strategy needs to be amended, the strategy will need updating and independently reviewed/checked.</p>

<p>106.4.3 Plotting of locations of interest (scene, mast locations and other specified addresses) may be conducted to provide an overview of the mobile telecommunications aspects of the case. These maps may be used to inform a more detailed surveying strategy or serve as the output in their own right (i.e. a theory-based ‘desk exercise’) including identifying the following.</p>

<p>a. Potential survey locations.</p>

<p>b. The relevant network(s) to survey.</p>

<p>c. Any variations from the scope as detailed in the quote/briefing sheet that may be required following an evaluation of the case scenario and case data.</p>

<p>106.4.4 Although the plotting of mast locations and estimated direction of service (for example, sectors) may be used in the planning process, any estimations or unverified information shall be marked up as such.</p>

<p>106.4.5 There are many ways in which analyses may be undertaken; case circumstances vary and so the methods used may also vary. The strategy shall therefore detail the rationale for the approach taken with reference to the survey type (for example, location, area surveyed, cell mapping) and mode selected (for example, idle, connected, Software Defined Radio).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.5 </span> Checking and Primary Review</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>106.5.1 The forensic unit shall have a procedure for checking (including for critical findings).</p>

<p>106.5.2 This section describes the following types of check and their expected application.</p>

<p>a. Examination Strategy Check.</p>

<p>b. Technical Check.</p>

<p>c. Critical Finding Check, including the manner of tiggering the check with the correct level of independence.</p>

<p>i. With full sight of the original practitioner’s findings (i.e. open); or</p>

<p>ii. With no sight of the original practitioner’s findings; or</p>

<p>iii. With no sight of the certain aspects of original practitioner’s experience-based findings (see 106.7.4).</p>

<p>106.5.3 The procedure shall ensure that check stages are clear, and it is clear when the independent check is to be performed blind. The expectation that decisions to blind any finding are made in the preceding stage(s), the practitioner may have a rule-based escalation route within their procedures to flag and/or separate out checks to be performed blind (see section 106.7.3 for criteria for triggering blind review). The identification of blind checks is enabled by either:</p>

<p>a. The expert generating the original report identifying those aspects of opinion that will require blind check.</p>

<p>b. The Technical Checker identifying those aspects that were critical findings but that they could not check via referenceable data or deductive inference.</p>

<p>106.5.4 The procedure does not have to specify the checks listed in 106.5.2, to be conducted in that order. Forensic unit’s may find that if the expert generating the original report identifying can identify aspects of opinion that will require blind check (i.e. 106.5.3a), and can present these separately for checking as in 106.5.2c.iii then this check may be performed first. Checking the aspects identified here before the technical check, may allow for the same checker to then perform the other checks. The procedure may include other alternative workflows, the intention is however for the person performing the blind check to not be sighted on original practitioner’s experience-based findings.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.6 </span> Examination Strategy Check</h3>

<p>106.6.1 The procedure for carrying out checks shall establish if work carried out conformed to the following.</p>

<p>a. Has the question presented been addressed?</p>

<p>b. Is the process adopted to answer the question legitimate and have the limitations been declared?</p>

<p>c. Is the method used applicable to the purpose? For example, a limited survey may demonstrate service of a cell at a given location at the time of that survey; If the cell does serve an area including the scene, an indication as to whether that cell is a particularly large cell (and therefore a less discriminating finding than otherwise might be the case) may be appropriate in the absence of a testable alternative proposition; this opinion may or may not be informed by survey data.</p>

<p>d. If a conclusion has been reached, is the question presented within the expertise of the examiner? Is the evidence expected given the conclusion drawn (i.e. is the supporting summary of findings correct and relevant)? For example, it is normally not possible to address legitimately whether it is likely that a person used a phone (rather than whether the data for a phone would be expected, given that a specific person used it).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.7 </span> Technical Check</h3>

<p>106.7.1 A technical check of the evidential product is made with reference to the report, supporting exhibits, and data on which the analysis has relied. It is therefore an “open” check, with awareness of the conclusions reached and with full access to the material relied on. The technical check is to ensure that:</p>

<p>a. Factual information (e.g. times, dates, locations, cell IDs) are correctly presented both in the report and supporting exhibits.</p>

<p>b. Opinions on technical matters, such as whether a given cell serves an area including a specific location are overt, based on verifiable information (e.g. survey data) and are supportable.</p>

<p>c. Local procedures have been followed and appropriate methods used.</p>

<p>d. Data relied upon has been converted/presented/ referenced correctly.</p>

<p>e. Survey data (if used) is appropriate and presented correctly,</p>

<p>f. Caveats concerning the findings are presented.</p>

<p>g. There is sufficient data to draw the conclusion offered.</p>

<p>h. The method used to draw the conclusion offered is appropriate.</p>

<p>i. The work is fully documented in the case notes.</p>

<p>j. There are appropriate checks on critical findings, calculations and data transfers.</p>

<p>k. Work is produced in compliance with the forensic unit’s documented policies and procedures.</p>

<p>l. Conclusions are consistent with the broader contents of the report or statement.</p>

<p>106.7.2 The forensic unit shall ensure that methods that require calculations (including those embedded in spreadsheets) and/or critical data transfers that do not form part of a validated process include checks carried out by a second person. A policy/procedure shall define the nature of the transfers and the checking procedure that shall consider the accuracy and/or applicability of the following:</p>

<p>a. Call data records.</p>

<p>i. The call data records are the foundation of cell site analysis. Call data are supplied in varying formats (according to network) and in a format that normally requires reformatting and/or normalisation, which should be validated (see 106.10.3).</p>

<p>ii. Specific call data that have been determined to be unreliable have been correctly excluded (for example, other party cell site information).</p>

<p>iii. Format of data (for example, call event nomenclature, time, date etc.).</p>

<p>iv. Normalisation of data (for example, conversion of latitude and longitude to British national grid, postcode to a co-ordinate system).</p>

<p>b. Mapping.</p>

<p>i. Presented data (for example, cell site locations,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:218" rel="footnote">[footnote 218]</a></sup> locations of interest) are correctly positioned and labelled. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:219" rel="footnote">[footnote 219]</a></sup></p>

<p>ii. If a period of call data is illustrated, the map illustrates all of that data. If an incomplete selection of data are presented, these are declared as such.</p>

<p>c. Survey.</p>

<p>i. Do the data correspond to the location of interest?</p>

<p>ii. If serving cell data<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:220" rel="footnote">[footnote 220]</a></sup> are presented, are these data an accurate reflection of the survey data (for example, correct network and protocol, correct cell ID)?</p>

<p>iii. Are there sufficient data to adequately answer the question presented?</p>

<p>106.7.3 Reasoning for, clarity of and supporting objective (referenceable) data (e.g. survey data indicates that the cell serves an area including the location of interest) for opinion on specific technical matters arising must also be checked, which include when:</p>

<p>a. Cell usage at specific dates and times contradict other events in a similar period, and cannot be easily explained.</p>

<p>b. A cell was expected to provide service at a location of interest, was on air during the survey, but was not detected there and opinion has been given on whether it would be expected to have served or not.</p>

<p>c. Service of a given cell was detected, but not as expected, (e.g. the survey results suggest irregularities with the reported azimuths from the CDR as might occur with “crossed-feeders”).</p>

<p>d. Cells which are detected serving at more than one of the key locations are highlighted (i.e. that other possible explanations of the data relevant to the propositions are raised, rather than “cherry picking” data expected given only one of the propositions).</p>

<p>106.7.4 Where all findings reviewed in 106.7.1 are fully supported by objective (referenceable) data then the critical finding check may proceed as an open check, however, if the finding(s) is based the experience of the practitioner rather than direct objective (referenceable) data this shall be considered for a blind check.</p>

<p>106.7.5 The procedure shall detail how casework is identified for checking blind, how individual aspects will be presented for checking, and/or how the full report is to be verified blind. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:221" rel="footnote">[footnote 221]</a></sup></p>

<p>106.7.6 Examples of situations which may trigger a blind check include:</p>

<p>a. Where a cell is used during the incident, the cell has not been measured, and comment is made on its potential service area including the locations specified in the prosecution and/ or defence propositions.</p>

<p>b. Where a cell is used during the incident, the cell has not been measured, and comment is made on its potential service area excluding the locations specified in the prosecution and/ or defence propositions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.8 </span> Critical Finding Check</h3>

<p>106.8.1 A Critical Finding is information (a fact or opinion) which directly and substantively affects the overall conclusions (i.e. whether the data as a whole might be expected given the declared propositions).</p>

<p>a. For example, if a cell was listed during the period of the offence, opinion on whether the time can be relied upon (e.g. for GPRS events) and whether the cell served an area including the scene and/ or alibi locations would be a critical finding (potentially amongst many other, similar, findings).</p>

<p>b. Conversely, other parts of the analysis (e.g. a commentary of general cell usage in periods where nothing specific is alleged by either prosecution or defence) would not be critical findings.</p>

<p>106.8.2 Where a critical findings check is the only substantive quality control procedure for checking that finding, then this check shall be performed without knowledge of the original result (i.e. blind) and this independence shall be identifiable from the records. Findings which have a blind check involves a second expert providing an independent technical opinion in isolation of the original opinion to be checked, this may be those aspects of opinion identified by the expert generating the original report, during the technical check or by another rules-based aspect of the procedure.</p>

<p>106.8.3 The critical finding check involves the review of the technical findings (with some elements being “blind” as required and as outlined above) against the proposition and an independent conclusion drawn which on completion is compared to the original conclusion by the first analysis.</p>

<p>106.8.4 This stage can also include the technical check of other data if applicable as long as the independent blind checks are completed first is undertaken by the same person.</p>

<p>106.8.5 This check will also review the complete report in context after the check on the conclusion is completed (with some elements being “blind” as required and as outlined above). Any disagreement is logged, and a conclusion acceptable to both parties reached, with reasons declared.</p>

<p>106.8.6 The Forensic Unit shall have a process in place to resolve differing opinions for the circumstance in which no such agreement can be reached, including how the issue is raised in the expert’s report. as part of the critical findings check on conclusion of analysis it can also include the final check on the follow.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.9 </span> Competence</h3>

<p>106.9.1 Each role in the examination shall be defined in the procedure, including the requirements for knowledge, training, experience and any specific qualifications for the tasks assigned to each role.</p>

<p>106.9.2 For practitioners involved in handling call data records and producing maps or tables from them, the training records shall define the role. The competences to be addressed shall include the following.</p>

<p>a. Acquisition of communications data.</p>

<p>b. Normalising data.</p>

<p>c. Quality assurance stages.</p>

<p>d. Accepted practices for differentiating between estimated coverage plotted for planning purposes and factual plotted data.</p>

<p>e. Presenting call data in the form of maps/tables and/or to produce an investigative or streamlined forensic report 1 (SFR 1).</p>

<p>106.9.3 Practitioners conducting a radio frequency (RF) propagation survey shall be assessed to demonstrate the following.</p>

<p>a. Ability to contribute to the development of a survey strategy or implement given or standardised strategies.</p>

<p>f. Area survey; and</p>

<p>g. Cell mapping.</p>

<p>ii. Apply the survey method;</p>

<p>iii. Correctly interpret the output of the survey.</p>

<p>c. Use of survey equipment in idle and connected modes.</p>

<p>d. Understanding of limitations of survey types and use of data.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:222" rel="footnote">[footnote 222]</a></sup></p>

<p>e. Where part of the role, knowledge of WiFi or other RF communications standards.</p>

<p>f. Understanding the responsibilities of expert witnesses and the role of assistants and analysts.</p>

<p>g. Preparation of reports.</p>

<p>106.9.4 The forensic unit shall demonstrate ongoing competency of all analytical staff. This may involve:</p>

<p>a. Reviewing technical records;</p>

<p>b. Completing a competence test involving a known outcome exercise or a repeatability study; and</p>

<p>c. A witnessing procedure to ensure that those conducting RF propagation surveys retain competence (ILAC-G19 3.8).</p>

<p>106.9.5 Training programmes shall include legal awareness training to include how the forensic unit’s procedures comply with the following:</p>

<p>a. Criminal Procedure Rules, specifically Parts 1, 3, 16 and 19; <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">35</a></p>

<p>b. Criminal Practice Directions V Part 19; <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a></p>

<p>106.9.6 Training programmes shall also include legal awareness training to include an overview of the following:</p>

<p>a. Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (if relevant to role); and</p>

<p>b. Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">129</a>.</p>

<p>106.9.7 Evaluative evidence in cell site analysis includes assessments of whether or not for a given call data record, for example the records would be expected if:</p>

<p>a. The data might be expected given that the user of the phone was at the scene during the offence (as alleged by the prosecution) or at their home address (as claimed by the defence)</p>

<p>b. The call data might be expected if the suspect was the user of the device, or whether there is any data in conflict with that proposition.</p>

<p>106.9.8 As well as the skill and competence required to technical activities (e.g. surveys, mapping, CDR normalisation) training programmes for staff involved in this activity shall include the following.</p>

<p>a. Development of a forensic strategy.</p>

<p>b. Assessment and interpretation skills:</p>

<p>i. formulating and testing hypotheses;</p>

<p>ii. awareness of the risk of transposing conditionals;<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:223" rel="footnote">[footnote 223]</a></sup> and</p>

<p>iii. appropriate terminology (see 106.2.4c).</p>

<p>c. Suitable theory training on what inference might be drawn from consideration:</p>

<p>i. Survey data (limitations from validation studies);</p>

<p>ii. Network appropriate knowledge of RF technology (i.e. network design and operation);</p>

<p>iii. Different types of CDR artefacts (e.g. GPRS or end cells).</p>

<p>d. Awareness of cognitive bias. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">23</a></p>

<p>e. Preparation of expert reports and statements.</p>

<p>106.9.9 Where members of staff are expected to give evidence in court, training programmes shall also include training in the presentation of expert evidence. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:224" rel="footnote">[footnote 224]</a></sup> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">27</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">21</a></p>

<p>106.9.10 The location of the device is not in the CDRs, but the area in which it was operating may be inferred from the detail within the records. Inference is synonymous with opinion, and all opinion evidence is expert evidence. If the purpose of the analysis is to assess where the phone was, this is expert activity.</p>

<p>106.9.11 Expressing opinions is the role of the expert witness; this includes providing evaluative evidence. Personnel interpreting results shall have been assessed and deemed competent before reporting statements, including in the interpretation and opinions of results and findings.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.10 </span> Validation</h3>

<h4>Selection of Methods</h4>

<p>106.10.1 All methods of examination/testing shall be fit for purpose; in demonstrating this, the forensic unit will need to have appropriate supporting validation/verification material compliant with the requirements of this Code. <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">33</a></p>

<p>106.10.2 The overall method selected shall be validated, tools are tested within the validation. Cell site analysis can comprise sub-methods, selected as required; each of these (for example, survey) can be validated as separate entities. The most appropriate method should be selected based on the strengths and limitations of those available to answer the needs of the customer.</p>

<h4>Validation of Methods</h4>

<p>106.10.3 It is a requirement that validation of methods shall have been undertaken prior to use in evidence. The whole process (i.e. from request/receipt of call data through to provision of final opinion) shall be validated for the method to be acceptable. If any aspect has not been validated, this shall be explicitly highlighted as a limitation in the accompanying report so that a court may take a view on admissibility.</p>

<p>106.10.4 Validation is about providing objective evidence that the method is fit-for-purpose; this is described in the end-user technical requirements and acceptance criteria. Objective evidence to demonstrate aspects of the end-user’s requirements may be drawn in part from:</p>

<p>a. A literature review;</p>

<p>b. The practitioner community;</p>

<p>c. Academic studies;</p>

<p>d. Collaborative trials;</p>

<p>e. Data collated by the forensic unit or training establishments (which require verifying by the forensic unit) using defined scenarios.</p>

<p>106.10.5 The validation procedure shall include where relevant, but is not limited to, the following.</p>

<p>a. Determining the end-user’s requirements and specification.</p>

<p>b. Risk assessment of the method.</p>

<p>c. A review of the end-user’s requirements and specification.</p>

<p>d. The acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>e. The validation plan.</p>

<p>f. The outcomes of the validation exercise.</p>

<p>g. Assessment of acceptance criteria compliance.</p>

<p>h. Validation report.</p>

<p>i. Statement of validation completion.</p>

<p>j. Implementation plan.</p>

<p>106.10.6 This Code describe in detail the requirements of all the above. However, some introductory words on the end-user requirement and further information on risk assessment requirements is given in the following sub-sections.</p>

<h4>Determining the End-User’s Requirements and Specification</h4>

<p>106.10.7 The end-user requirements include interim-user requirements but should be framed by the end-user being the wider CJS.</p>

<p>106.10.8 This is about the method not the requirements of the specific equipment used. It is not a reiteration of the user manual of survey equipment or phone emulator. The requirements and specification are used to gauge the scale of validation study based upon the acceptance criteria defined.</p>

<h4>Risk Assessment of a Method</h4>

<p>106.10.9 A risk assessment is required and is used to determine the hazards of a method. The validation shall test the mitigation strategy to control the identified risks. The test employed may vary according to the method.</p>

<p>106.10.10 Within the CJS, some risks may be defined as:</p>

<p>a. False positives (for example, stating that a phone was, or may have been, in an area where it could not); or</p>

<p>b. False negatives (for example, stating that a phone could not have been in an area where it could).</p>

<p>106.10.11 The risk assessment is used to develop the validation plan; risks identified should be tested against the overall method. The method is more than the test of survey equipment; for instance the method may require additional activity to give assurance that the risk of identified types of false negatives are managed in a way that the testing of instrumentation alone would not give (for example, in Section 106.11.6).</p>

<p>106.10.12 The risk analysis shall assess all of the technical stages that may contribute to these risks being realised. Examples include the following.</p>

<p>a. Call data record normalisation:</p>

<p>i. Transcription errors;</p>

<p>ii. Inclusion of incorrect information (for example, ‘other party’ cell site) without recognising it as such;</p>

<p>iii. Exclusion of legitimate information (for example, transcription errors); and</p>

<p>iv. Use of GPRS without recognising limitations.</p>

<p>b. Mapping:</p>

<p>i. Misrepresentation of a cell site in the wrong location, for example, labelled with an incorrect time of usage and/or cell identification; and</p>

<p>ii. Inappropriate sector representation.</p>

<p>c. Survey:</p>

<p>i. Failing to detect a legitimately serving cell relevant to the case (methods that rely solely on a static survey are prone to this); and</p>

<p>ii. Failing to recognise that there may have been a network change (for example, not checking that a cell of interest is off air at the time of the survey).</p>

<p>d. Interpretation:</p>

<p>i. Cognitive bias;</p>

<p>ii. Incorrectly identifying reasonable propositions;</p>

<p>iii. Not assessing and expressing uncertainty in findings in a meaningful way;</p>

<p>iv. Inadequate quality management of any of the risks above.</p>

<h4>Statement of Validation Completion</h4>

<p>106.10.13 This Code require that a statement of validation completion is prepared. The forensic unit may conduct a RF propagation survey as a separate service (such as for virtual ‘scene preservation’ in response to an incident to capture serving cell activity) to cell site analysis. In this instance although aspects of the validation study may be shared, separate statements of validation completion may be appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">106.11 </span> Uncertainty in Measurement</h3>

<p>106.11.1 There are inherent uncertainties within cell site analysis no matter which methods have been applied. This Code and ISO17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> require the forensic unit to identify the contributions to measurement uncertainty, noting that ISO17025 <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">1</a> accepts that where “the test method precludes rigorous evaluation of measurement uncertainty, an estimation shall be made based on an understanding of the theoretical principles or practical experience of the performance of the method.”</p>

<p>106.11.2 Networks can change over time and there may be differences in network operation between the time that the activity took place and the time the activity is analysed in the context of an investigation. Some aspects may be physical changes (for example, changes to the built environment, cells being added, removed or reoriented, decommissioning of assets in 3G network, Stacked cells) or organisational (for example, routing or location area boundaries that may affect cell boundaries). There may also be temporary equipment faults.</p>

<p>106.11.3 Full cell site surveys assist in estimating the area where a mobile device was. However, further uncertainty within surveys can result from the following.</p>

<p>a. Any changes to the network in the area considered during the time that has elapsed since the event of interest and that of the survey.</p>

<p>b. Survey equipment may not directly reflect the operation of the questioned device.</p>

<p>c. Interpretation of the data (false positives/negatives).</p>

<p>d. The height at which the survey was undertaken compared with the actual location and the height that the original connection was made to the cell site in question.</p>

<p>106.11.4 Given these uncertainties, cell site analysis will not be able to pinpoint the location of the subject device. The terminology used in reports shall reflect this when referring to specific locations that were assessed. For example, phrases such as “the cell used by the subject phone was detected providing service over a cell service area that includes [the location of interest]” may be appropriate.</p>

<p>106.11.5 For example, a practitioner with the appropriate competence may be able to comment on the general anticipated coverage area of cells of interest, and thereby provide some context to their findings. For example, assessing the expected coverage area of a cell from the network information, if it is:</p>

<p>a. An indoor cell (in which case usage implies that the user was within the building – a very precise assessment); <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:225" rel="footnote">[footnote 225]</a></sup></p>

<p>b. A 3m street works dwarfed by the surrounding buildings (in which case the service area may only be that and possibly a few adjoining streets, again, a relatively precise assessment);</p>

<p>c. A large rural macro cell based on the top of a 60m tower (which may provide a service over a large area, perhaps 10 or 20km from the mast and thus provides much lower precision and is potentially of lesser evidential impact).</p>

<p>106.11.6 There shall be a policy or procedure that includes additional activities that are undertaken if it has been concluded that a cell does not serve at a specific location when it is expected to and that is relevant to the case. This shall include one or more of the following.</p>

<p>a. Assessing antenna point direction (azimuth).</p>

<p>b. Examine the path profile between mast and location to check for obvious terrain obstructions, etc.</p>

<p>c. Reviewing survey data to identify if the cell seen in other locations (contributes to verifying that it is on air without visiting the cell).</p>

<p>d. Reviewing neighbour data to see if the frequency that the cell is on is visible or used by a different cell.</p>

<p>e. Checking the mast location by visiting or even via Google Maps Street View to see if the cell is:</p>

<p>i. Physically present; and</p>

<p>ii. Links appear intact and/or if visiting is on air.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that there may not be obvious signs when replay software is performing incorrectly, so where the footage is to be used for further analysis rather than simply viewing it is good practice is to follow the dual approach, and to document any reason why this has not been possible or relevant in the case. It is also worth noting that the video files exported from the digital systems may contain additional information, e.g. audio, Global Positioning System (GPS), which is not presented by the replay software. If this type of information is of relevance to the case the examiner should investigate further.
