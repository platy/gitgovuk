<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Prior to coronavirus (COVID-19), procurement of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) was not centralised. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> was purchased locally by health and social care providers who had the autonomy to choose their own suppliers. Previously, health and social care providers sourced their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from a range of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> wholesalers or manufacturers. This included NHS Supply Chain, a limited company currently owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, designed to help the NHS deliver clinically assured, quality products at the best value.</p>

<p>As the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak developed, global demand for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> soared. This significantly disrupted <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supply chains and the wholesale market for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Health and care providers experienced significant difficulty acquiring <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> at an affordable price in the volumes needed to deliver services safely. With the wholesale market struggling to respond to this increased demand, and to ensure the viability of services in the face of soaring costs, government took a central role in the procurement and supply of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to health and care settings, many of which had never had the need for certain items of medical-grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) launched a new online portal to support over 50,000 primary care and social care providers with accessing their COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements, free of charge.  More than 58,000 eligible health and social care providers in England – including GPs, adult social care providers, dentists, orthodontists, optometrists and pharmacies – have been invited to register with, and order their COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements through the online <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal, free of charge. Around 53,000 providers have registered, receiving over 4 billion items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> so far to support their COVID-19 needs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also set up bespoke distribution routes via local authorities and local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>) for those services that could not be supplied through the portal and to distribute free COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to other public sector services such as schools. Palliative and end of life care services, such as hospices, were supplied via regional hubs. While <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has supported other government departments to provide <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to other public sector services during the pandemic, these non-health and care settings are out of scope for this consultation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme which runs these <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supply and distribution routes, currently sits within <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> but is due to transition to NHS Supply Chain by 31 March 2022. The current supply and distribution routes will continue until then.</p>

<p>Across these distribution routes, the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme has distributed over 14 billion items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the frontline. The cost of this <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is approximately £2.9 billion.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is currently due to end its free, central <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provision from 1 April 2022. At this point, health and care providers will need to purchase <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from a supplier of their choice. However, given current case levels and guidance, we expect <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage to remain at COVID-19 levels beyond March 2022 putting significant upward pressure on health and care costs in the next financial year. We have sufficient stock centrally to continue to support providers to meet their COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> needs. The department is therefore considering whether to extend central, free provision.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage during COVID-19 has been largely driven by the changes in guidance produced by the United Kingdom Infection Prevention and Control (<abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr>) Cell which sits within NHS England and Improvement. The <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> Cell continually monitors and reviews emerging evidence and data and the guidance is amended accordingly if needed. The guidance forms the basis of primary and secondary care measures in both public and private healthcare settings and is also adapted to form the ‘How to work safely’ guidance for social care settings.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> guidance is a response to the prevailing state of the pandemic. In response to COVID-19, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage increased dramatically across all categories. Usage increased at least 3-fold compared to 2019 for all items and, in some categories, usage in one week during COVID-19 is the same as the total amount used in 2019. While the UK vaccination programme has been a success and restrictions are progressively coming to an end, the trajectory of the COVID-19 remains highly uncertain. We cannot therefore predict what, if any, changes will be made to the <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> guidance by 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> guidance does not recommend a change in <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage between now and 31 March 2022, then the same high volumes of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will continue to be used across the health and care system. Assuming that volumes do remain the same, the cost to the health and care sector, including <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, in 2022 to 2023 will be:</p>

      <td>£1.4   billion</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The costs of ending free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> are higher as we already hold stock centrally which would need to be newly purchased if free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> were to end. While the department is exploring funding options, we cannot guarantee that the government will be able to support health and care providers with this additional cost. We do hold sufficient stock centrally to support health and care providers to meet their COVID-19 needs through 2022 to 2023. Therefore, if COVID-19 levels of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> are still needed from 1 April 2022, then the department may need to extend the provision of free, central <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to ensure services can meet their COVID-19 needs and keep frontline workers protected. However, this requires the department continuing to intervene in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market in the UK which could have a negative impact on the businesses who operate in this market. This consultation therefore seeks stakeholder views on extending the current free provision.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>This consultation covers all health and care settings. There are non-health and care settings who currently receive the free, central provision but these are out of scope of this consultation. The table below sets out which customer groups are in scope:</p>

<h2>Potential options</h2>

<p>The department is considering the following 2 options for the current free provision of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond the current end date of 31 March 2022.</p>

<h3>Option 1: extend free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for 12 months</h3>

<p>The first option is to extend the central, free provision for all items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> already provided for free under the current scheme. For some customers (not NHS trusts) who currently receive their free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> via distribution routes other than the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal, these routes may need to change, and customers onboarded to the portal.</p>

<p>We propose extending for 12 months. As we do not expect the key drivers of extending to have changed until at least the end of the 2022 to 2023 financial year, we will likely need to consider another extension further down the line if we extend for a shorter period of time. However, extending now for 12 months provides certainty over the whole financial year.</p>

<h4>Potential impacts of this option:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>impacts on the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market: this would involve continued government intervention in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market, continuing to limit other actors in this part of the market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impact on health and care providers: this would remove the cost burden from providers of purchasing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for the length of the extension, reducing the risk of non-compliance with <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> guidance, and mitigating against reduced provider viability. This would ensure health and care workers are protected while COVID-19 remains prevalent. This would also mitigate against potential increased costs from some services being pushed onto the users of these services</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Option 2: no extension of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond 31 March 2022</h3>

<p>The second option is to end the central, free provision of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> on 31 March 2022. From 1 April 2022, health and care providers will need to purchase their own <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and will be free to choose their own suppliers.</p>

<h4>Potential impacts of this option:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>impact on the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market: government would no longer be intervening in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impact on health and care providers: this option would increase the cost burden on providers. The department is considering potential funding options to help mitigate this. However, this funding would only be available for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in line with <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> guidance and cannot be guaranteed. However, if providers were to bear the entire cost, there is a risk of non-compliance with <abbr title="Infection Prevention and Control">IPC</abbr> guidance if providers cannot afford the additional cost. There is also a risk that some adult social care services may become unviable if funding is unavailable</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence gathered from the consultation will help inform our decision, including whether the same approach should be applied to all types of health and care providers.</p>
