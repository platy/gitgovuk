<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<h3>What we proposed</h3>

<p>In response to COVID-19, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) has provided free access to centrally procured personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) to NHS trusts, adult social care providers, as well as primary care and some other healthcare providers. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has previously committed to providing this central, free provision of COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (subsequently referred to as ‘<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>’) until 31 March 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout October 2021, we conducted a public consultation on whether to extend the central, free provision of all items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided to the health and care sector for a further year.</p>

<p>The overarching principles we have considered when developing this policy and analysing responses are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the trajectory of the pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to protect front-line health and care staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact on the businesses who operate in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What we heard</h3>

<p>We received 5,267 consultation responses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>65% on behalf of organisations</li>
  <li>35% from individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>The main sectors responding to the consultation were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>social care (37% of responses)</li>
  <li>primary care (36%)</li>
  <li>community health care (8%)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the consultation responses showed that the overwhelming majority of health and care providers are strongly in favour of the option to extend the provision of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The main themes that we identified among those responses in favour of the continuation of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> are that the scheme has and will continue to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>protect staff and patients in a broad range of settings, allowing them to continue delivering their services safely</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relieve them of the financial burden associated with higher <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements, and the rising costs of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alleviate the burden of undertaking procurement thus allowing health and care providers to focus on their patients and residents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enable access to quality <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> of a reliable standard from a trustworthy source, which is particularly important while case numbers are still high, as face-to-face appointments are increased and to mitigate against any risk associated with waning immunity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although the proportion of respondents not in favour of extending free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> was meaningfully smaller (4%), 87% of wholesalers and suppliers indicated that they were not in favour of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> being extended.</p>

<p>The main reasons for not supporting the continuation of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for a further year beyond 31 March 2022 were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(in the case of wholesalers) they have already lost revenue and customers, and think <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> should not continue to interfere with the market and should come up with alternative solutions instead</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the supply issues from the early days of the pandemic have been resolved and we should go back to pre-pandemic arrangements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Our response and plan for the future</h3>

<p>The government is grateful to those who took the time to provide their views as part of the consultation and has considered all their views carefully. In response to the consultation, and in order to help protect health and care staff while COVID-19 case levels are still high and high <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage is still required by infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance, the government has decided to extend the provision of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the health and care sector to 31 March 2023 or until such time as the UK <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance is withdrawn or significantly amended, whichever is sooner.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has recruited users to test a new platform that will replace the current <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Portal. This is a representative group of existing portal users from across all sectors, experience levels and users’ needs. User research began in January.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In response to COVID-19, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> centralised the procurement of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> across much of the health and care sector to ensure much needed <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> was delivered to the frontline. As part of the department’s <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> COVID-19 response, it has provided free access to central <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> stocks to NHS trusts, adult social care providers, as well as primary care and some other healthcare providers. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has previously committed to providing this central, free provision of COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> until 31 March 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The Chief Medical Officer has advised that it is expected that COVID-19 will circulate widely around the world with significant and damaging surges in some geographical areas for at least the next 18 months and, depending on vaccination and variants, probably longer.</p>

<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage in healthcare settings is driven by the requirements set out in the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance. Given current case levels and the recent emergence of the Omicron variant of concern, we do not expect to see a significant change in guidance on requirements for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use. We anticipate that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage will remain at COVID-19 levels beyond March 2022 putting significant upward pressure on health and care costs in the next financial year.</p>

<p>Supporting our front-line health and care staff is our priority. However, the department recognises that continuing to intervene in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> market in the UK could have a negative impact on the businesses who operate in this market. In light of this, throughout October 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> conducted a public consultation on whether to extend the central, free provision of all items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided to the health and care sector after 31 March 2022.</p>

<h3>Our consultation</h3>

<p>The department sought views from a wide range of stakeholders via this consultation in order to ensure a well-balanced and evidence-based decision.</p>

<p>We received responses from a range of people and organisations including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary and social care providers</li>
  <li>community health care services</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> wholesalers and suppliers</li>
</ul>

<p>We have analysed the responses and noted specific concerns about whether or not to extend the provision of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to health and care sectors beyond March 2022. This document summarises the responses received and the main points raised.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The consultation was open to anyone to respond to but was focused on the supply of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to health and care settings. There are non-health and care settings who currently receive the free, central provision <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> but these settings are out of scope of this consultation. Annex A below sets out which user groups were in scope.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The consultation, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/extending-free-ppe-to-the-health-and-care-sector/extending-free-ppe-to-the-health-and-care-sector">Extending free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the health and care sector</a>, comprised of closed-ended (quantitative) and open-ended (qualitative or free text) questions (see annex B below).</p>

<p>For the close-ended questions we analysed the number and percentage of respondents answering each question, and also broke down responses by type of respondent (for example, member of the public, social care provider, representative organisation or body).</p>

<p>Responses to the consultation are not representative of the groups referenced, but only of those who chose to respond to the consultation. Where particular groups are referred to or compared, this refers only to those responding to the consultation and cannot be taken to represent the views of the public more generally.&nbsp; Differences between responding groups have been highlighted using judgement. We have assumed in analysis that respondents submitted responses in good faith which, if given, accurately represent their characteristics and their view. For example, we take at face value those selecting ‘individual – social care’ are indeed from this group, as verification was not sought.</p>

<p>See annex C (below) for further details on the methods used to analyse the responses.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<h3>Who responded</h3>

<p>A total of 5,267 responses were received.</p>

<p>There were 5,238 completed responses to the consultation received through the&nbsp;GOV.UK page and 29 unique responses received via email.</p>

<p>65% of responses were on behalf of organisations; 35% were from individuals.</p>

<h4>Key themes that occurred in the ‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’ responses</h4>

<p>Those in support of extending free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond March 2022 want this arrangement to continue because of the costs associated with COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements and the burden this places on them. They reported that continuing free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will allow them to continue providing their services while protecting staff, patients and the public. &nbsp;</p>

<p>They also say that having free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has alleviated the stress involved in resourcing and procuring <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, and that it provides stable access to quality <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> of a reliable standard from a trustworthy source.</p>

<p>Responses differed slightly by sector. For social care respondents, the top themes that emerged included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the costs of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and the burden that this would place on providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> enables them to continue to protect the safety of staff and the public</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a lack of their own funding for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Top themes for primary care respondents included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> allows them to deliver face-to-face and close contact services or appointments while protecting themselves and service users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the financial burden of funding <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> themselves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the continuing need for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond March 2022</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For community health care services, the top themes included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> allows them to ensure the safety of staff and the public</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the financial burden of funding <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> themselves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>centralised provision alleviates the stress and burden of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and gives assurance that they are using good quality <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate, a social care provider stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We simply could not afford the amount financially to buy the huge numbers needed. There is also a huge admin burden [having] to track down suppliers, order, check and pay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One GP stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The challenge on primary care budgets is higher than it has been in some time. Costs are increasing from all suppliers due to increased fuel or supply costs and this is already eating into the primary care budget. Adding the costs of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to this will reduce the budget further adding extra pressure and could result in having to reduce staffing and hours to fund these increased costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another GP said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">[…] we are seeing increasing numbers of patients in primary care and the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> requirement has not been relaxed and neither should it be. We are using significantly more <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> than before COVID. For example, the cost to meet the requirement to provide a Type II face covering for each and every patient would be prohibitively expensive to general practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A respondent from the dentistry sector wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This has helped us protect staff and patients without financial worries. Essentially we would have to limit the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage if we had to purchase our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One community health care service responded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As a private provider, our margins are very slim in order to remain competitive, so the cost of providing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> on a daily basis is not viable financially.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another primary care service stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It’s a cost that we cannot afford being a small business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A social care provider said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Given the other issues we are dealing with on a daily basis, especially recruitment and retention, to not have to worry about sourcing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is of huge benefit in many different ways. From stress and management time spent looking for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and getting the best price and the cost savings are also very helpful thanks, especially given cost pressures elsewhere in our sector – especially in staff cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An acute health service provider added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Not having to source and raise orders for the increased volumes and variety of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been a blessing during the pandemic and will continue to be so in the uncertain times ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Respondents from the health and care sector did not provide any substantive quantitative evidence on the impact of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to date or the potential impact if free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is not extended.</p>

<h4>Key themes that occurred in the ‘disagree’ and ‘strongly disagree’ responses</h4>

<p>Only 4% of respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that the scheme should continue, but it is important to note that although they made up a much smaller proportion of respondents, the majority of wholesalers or suppliers of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (87%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with extending free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Their key concerns were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the impact of the scheme on their businesses in terms of loss of revenue and job losses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the need to implement alternative or longer-term solutions, which involve central government working in partnership with commercial suppliers&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the (perceived) lack of need for <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to provide the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> now that supply issues have been resolved and prices have dropped</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate, one wholesaler argued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We fully understand and support the reasons why <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> centralised procurement of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global demand outstripped supply and prices were increasing rapidly leading to unprecedented challenges in the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supply chain. This intervention was necessary to ensure health and care providers could access the volumes of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> required to deliver services safely at an affordable price.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Despite the continued high demand for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> by health and care providers, the unprecedented challenge on the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supply chain does not exist today. Global supply has now increased to meet this new demand and manufacturing price is almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, we no longer see the need for such intervention by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another wholesaler stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The decision to provide free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> had a huge impact on us as a business as we had stocked up in good faith to support care homes only for the government to suddenly provide <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> FOC [free of charge] and left us with a considerable amount of excess stock that we are now unable to sell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, a supplier stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We have millions of disposable aprons sitting in our warehouse because the government have continued with giving free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to all hospitals, nursing homes, GP and dental surgeries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other wholesalers stated similar things, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are an independent medical wholesaler supplying care homes with <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and other products, since government intervention by supplying free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to care homes our turnover on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> products mainly gloves and aprons gone down by 42%&nbsp;and this has put our company to a difficult position. We were hoping by the end of March 2022 (end of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> period) we can get back to some normality, if government extend the free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> beyond March 2022 for 12 months that would make our position even worse and won’t be able to run our business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supplier said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> continues to supply <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge to the adult social sector until March 2022 (and beyond) our business is at risk of going into administration or at the best laying off staff. We are concerned that the decision of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to continue to intervene in the market for the supply of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will have a lasting and detrimental impact on an existing and future competitive market and our business. These decisions have resulted in significant financial losses to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Qualitative responses to the consultation illustrate there has been an impact to wholesalers and suppliers. However, wholesalers and suppliers did not provide any substantive quantitative evidence of the impact of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to their business – for example, job losses. The supply of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> only. Health and care providers are expected to purchase their business-as-usual <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from other sources including wholesalers and suppliers.</p>

<h3>Question 2: are there other options we should consider?</h3>
</div>

<h4>Consultation feedback</h4>

<p>21% of respondents replied that yes, there were other options we should consider.&nbsp;Responses again varied by sector. Social care, primary care and community health service respondents commonly raised ideas around identifying other ways of meeting <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs – for example continuing to provide some items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for free, or that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be subsidised or discounted, or providers being given grants or allowances to cover costs. They also wanted to see more flexibility on the type and/or amounts of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> available to them.</p>

<p>In addition, a number of social care respondents mentioned wanting to see wider reforms in social care such as increased funding and higher salaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some respondents from primary care and community health services referred to the importance of maintaining a reliable supply of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in order to be able to respond to future demand shocks, including support for UK manufacturing, ensuring good supply chains and maintaining stock centrally. The latter group also talked about wanting free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to continue on a longer-term basis.</p>

<p>A number of wholesalers and suppliers referred to the excess stock that they hold and making better use of this.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 3 (for hospices only): to what extent do you agree that the regional hubs should be stood down and hospices onboarded on to the portal?</h3>
</div>

<h4>Consultation feedback</h4>

<p>Besides the key consultation question about whether or not to extend free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the health and care sectors beyond March 2022, there was a dedicated question for hospices regarding access to the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal. Hospices currently receive free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> via a series of regional hubs which are largely reliant on volunteers, rather than via the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal or local authorities or local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>). We asked respondents representing hospices the extent to which they agreed that the regional hubs should be stood down and hospices onboarded to the portal.</p>

<p>49% of the respondents to this question either agreed or strongly agreed that hospices should be onboarded to the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal. The reasons that are given are that they hope the portal allows them to order <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is clinically assured. Others feel that the portal would allow them to tailor their orders more efficiently, cut down on travel distances to collect from hubs, and that the portal might make the system less reliant on volunteers. On the former, it is worth pointing out that the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> received through the regional hubs is of the same quality as the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is distributed through the portal. The <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> programme has a standard process for assessing and assuring the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> products that have been purchased and this determines whether or not products are suitable to be released to the frontline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>15% disagreed because they think that the hubs are efficient and useful, cut down on administrative tasks for smaller organisations, and are a proven method.</p>

<p>The remainder of respondents either did not know which option they preferred, or neither agreed nor disagreed. These respondents report they do not have a preference for either the hub system or the portal, as long as they continue to receive supply. Some hospices mentioned needing more information about the portal in order to ensure it meets their needs.</p>

<p>The consultation responses included some positive feedback about hospices moving onto the portal to acquire <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. We will continue to work with delivery partners to consider how best to take forward this work. Any changes to current arrangements will be communicated in due course.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 4: do you have any other views related to this consultation that you would like to express?</h3>
</div>

<h4>Consultation feedback</h4>

<p>We received 1,270 relevant responses to this question. Many social care respondents and respondents from community health services referred to the pressures on staff caused by the pandemic as well as the costs that would be associated with these providers needing to buy their own <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. In addition, a common theme from social care respondents was to express gratitude for the free provision to date, signalling how much it had helped them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Themes identified in the responses from primary care respondents included the fact that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> makes staff feel safer in delivering their services.</p>

<p>The wholesalers and suppliers who chose to respond to this question reiterated concerns raised about the proposal to extend free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. This included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>questioning the need for an extension of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> because of the present widespread availability of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>stressing the impact this would have on their business</li>
  <li>reiterating the view that the government should not continue to interfere with the market</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our decision</h2>

<p>The government is grateful to those that took the time to provide their views as part of the consultation and has considered these carefully.</p>

<p>Responses to the consultation demonstrate that high numbers of respondents are in favour of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> continuing free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provision over the next financial year, typically health and care providers. These respondents reported that the costs of COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> would place significant financial burdens on them which could have negative impacts on their services.</p>

<p>Some providers said that the costs would be unaffordable for them, and that this could result in staff going without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, making up for the extra costs by cutting back staff hours, or having to reduce their services. They also said that continuing free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> would help them continue to provide their services while still protecting staff and patients.</p>

<p>However, the majority of wholesalers and suppliers disagreed with an extension of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, expressing concern about the impact this would have on their businesses and questioning the need for an extension of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage is driven by <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance which sets out the requirements for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in the health sector. This is mirrored in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">how to work safely in care homes</a> guidance which applies to care workers in care homes.&nbsp; Although hospital cases and deaths are thankfully not as high as they were earlier in the pandemic, the NHS and other frontline services are under immense pressure as a result of COVID-19 and other demands on services.</p>

<p>The recent NHS report on priorities and operational planning guidance stresses that the typical seasonal pressure on the NHS seen over the winter period is likely to be “intensified by the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”.&nbsp;In addition, the government’s Chief Medical Officer recently advised that it is expected that COVID-19 will circulate widely around the world with significant and damaging surges in some geographical areas for at least the next 18 months and, depending on vaccination and variants, probably longer. The pathway through the pandemic is even more uncertain now with the emergence of the Omicron variant of concern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> cell is currently meeting weekly to review evidence following the emergence of the Omicron variant. Based on ongoing engagement with the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> cell, it seems clear that the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage is unlikely to step down significantly before spring, meaning <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements are expected to continue at current levels for the time being. The last <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">update to <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance was published on 21 December 2021</a> to reflect the consensus opinion on Omicron. In the event of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance being withdrawn in 2022 to 2023, the department will issue a press release to inform stakeholders that the supply of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will come to an end.</p>

<p>As set out above, asking providers to absorb <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs would have significant financial impacts on them, which could have negative impacts on their services, their staff and the people they care for. Maintaining free provision while we are still in the midst of the pandemic will help to ensure a stable and equitable supply of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to health and care sectors for the period April 2022 to March 2023, or until the point <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance is withdrawn or amended significantly (whichever is sooner). This will enable all providers to comply with <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage, allowing them to continue to deliver frontline services while also protecting frontline staff and the people they care for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The market for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has increased exponentially as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The supply of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> only. Health and care providers are expected to purchase their business-as-usual <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from other sources including wholesalers and suppliers.  However, we recognise the concerns that wholesalers and suppliers have raised in the consultation about the impact on their businesses and the people they employ. Our impact assessment, which we expect to publish shortly, illustrates that the policy represents the effective use of public money to support health and social care services in delivering care in a way that protects the safety of the workforce and service users.</p>

<p>We will mitigate some of these concerns by continuing to emphasise that we are supplying <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> only for COVID-19 requirements, with providers still needing to purchase their business-as-usual <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from wholesalers and other suppliers. The order limits on the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal are set with this in mind, with limits based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the latest available public health guidance</li>
  <li>COVID-19 trends</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements modelling</li>
  <li>analysis</li>
  <li>provider feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>We regularly review these order limits to check they are proportionate. In particular we will be pushing to ensure there is appropriate usage of nitrile gloves and that these are only used for COVID-19 purposes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, government has decided to extend free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to health and care sectors by up to one year to the end of March 2023 or until the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> usage for COVID-19 is either withdrawn or significantly amended (whichever is sooner).</p>

<h2>Annex C: methodology</h2>

<p>For the analysis of the open-ended questions, we identified key themes across all responses, and counted the number of times each theme was referred to per respondent type, using a recognised data science technique.</p>

<p>More specifically, we used an ‘unsupervised clustering’ data science technique to label each response with topics. This technique looks for clusters of words that appear frequently with each other in responses. We manually label these word clusters to give them a ‘human meaning’. For example, if the words ‘cost’, ‘financial’, ‘pressure’ and ‘funding’ appear in a cluster, we infer that this cluster is relating to financial pressures. Each cluster of words is known as a ‘topic’.</p>

<p>The process then maps these topics onto each open-ended consultation response, giving a probability that a given topic is being discussed in each response. We set a cut-off probability value, taking only the top, most likely topics per response. From this we have labelled each consultation response with discrete, common topics. We then analysed the results to see which topics were most frequently discussed by each respondent type, which respondent types were raising common themes, identifying key themes in the responses.</p>
