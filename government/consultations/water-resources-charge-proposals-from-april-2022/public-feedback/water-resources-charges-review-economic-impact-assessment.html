<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>In order to understand the potential impact of our charging proposals for water resources we have conducted this first stage impact assessment focusing on the largest charge increases and small companies.</p>

<p>The data that we used for this analysis mostly refers to subsistence charges, not applications. Subsistence charges are a better indication of impact as they are an ongoing charge as opposed to a one-off application charge. Though application charges are considered for one sector where there are currently no subsistence charges (hydropower).</p>

<p>It is important to note that this impact assessment uses in most cases pre-COVID-19 company and sector information and therefore reflects a different economic state based on steadier conditions. At the moment, some of these companies will be facing uncertainty and disruption, but the economic impact of this is still unknown and therefore has not been included in the analysis.</p>

<p>We recognise that the charges that businesses pay are commercially sensitive, for this reason we do not name any specific licensee in this document.</p>

<p>The rest of this document presents the detailed analysis of the impacts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Economic impact assessment</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Methodology</h3>

<p>We have reviewed the data considering the current level of charge and the proposed charge. We have analysed the data looking at the additional charge that licence holders will pay under the proposals and their turnover in order to assess the potential impact of the increase. For this part of the assessment we are looking at subsistence charges only.</p>

<p>For multiple licence holders, we have calculated the total amount they will pay for all their licences. It is worth noting that not all of the charges are increasing, and for some multiple licence holders the increases will be offset by the decreases.</p>

<p>The methodology used means that we have considered the impact on private companies and individuals. We have not looked at the impacts on local authorities and other public sector bodies, as public bodies are funded differently and therefore the affordability of charges cannot be assessed by considering turnover and profits.</p>

<p>In order to assess the significance of the impacts we have used company turnover and gross profit data (where available) from publicly available sources (Companies House). The data is usually available some months after the close of a company’s financial year, so represents the period prior to the coronavirus pandemic. Table 1 shows the range of impact on affordability relative to turnover and gross profit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Overview of the data</h3>

<p>The total number of licences in the dataset was 16,857. Around 5,050 of these were identified as belonging to individuals and households and had to be removed from the analysis, as there is no Companies House information about these customers, leaving just under 12,000 licences. The charges that were decreasing were removed. The dataset was then analysed to identify multiple licence holders and the net change in their charges. In total 5,416 licences were removed as the cost to the licence holder was decreasing, leaving 6,388 licences belonging to 3,018 licence holders.</p>

<p>Table 2 groups these licences into wide sectors and shows the number of licences and licence holders in each sector as well as the total and average increases in each category.</p>

<p>Note 1 - These are companies, limited companies, other organisations that can be confidently identified as farming businesses.</p>

<p>Note 2 - This might include also farms, individuals, large and small companies. However, this is not clear from the name of the licence holder and can only be clarified once further analysis undertaken.</p>

<p>Note 3 - Limited companies might include farms, large and small companies from different sectors.</p>

<p>Note 4 - Includes various associations (for example, religious, charities) and private and charitable trusts that do not fit in any other category.</p>

<p>Note 5 - Includes organisations such as non-governmental organisations (<abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr>), wildlife trusts and so forth.</p>

<p>Water companies currently pay some 90% of the total charge income and are seeing a proportionate amount of the increase in charges. Even though the numbers are large, water companies are big companies with large turnovers, so we do not anticipate any significant impacts from the charge increases.</p>

<p>The largest category in terms of number of both licence holders and actual licences (almost half of total licences) is agriculture. Despite the size of the category, it only pays for 1.2% of the total increase in charges. The impacts on this group are assessed in the next section.</p>

<p>The limited companies category is the second largest in terms of number of licences and licence holders and accounts for 4.3% of the total increase in charge payments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Impact assessment</h2>

<p>The rest of this impact assessment focuses on only 3 of the categories identified earlier – ‘agriculture’, ‘companies’ and ‘limited companies’. This is because we particularly want to focus on the impacts for small, medium enterprises (<abbr title="small, medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr>) and these can be found within these 3 categories only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Analysis</h3>

<p>The range of charge increases in the remaining licences is very variable both in terms of percentage change but also in actual terms (£). In order to identify material impacts all charge increases up to £50 were removed, regardless of the % increase this represented. Next, we removed all increases up to 20%, as again they are not expected to have any material impact on the finances of the companies. This left 1,962 licence holders in all categories, 1,739 of which are in the 3 categories we are focusing on.</p>

<p>We then selected a sample from the remaining licences, focussing particularly on the small companies with less than 50 employees. Information on size, turnover and gross profit was collected (from Companies’ House) where available.</p>

<p>The results are presented as follows.</p>

<h4>No impacts</h4>

<p>Companies that will face no impacts either because they are too big for the changes to be material or have been dissolved or dormant.</p>

<h4>No impacts <abbr title="small, medium enterprise">SME</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Companies that are small (less than 50 employees) but their turnover is high enough for them not to face any negative impacts from the charge increases, that is the new proposed charge is less than 0.5% of their turnover.</p>

<h4>Impacts unknown <abbr title="small, medium enterprise">SME</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Companies that are small or micro-companies, we have found them registered but no financial information is available in order to calculate the impacts. This is because some companies<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> are exempt from publishing their detailed accounts, therefore information on turnover and profit is not available.</p>

<h4>Impacts known <abbr title="small, medium enterprise">SME</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Companies that are small or micro-companies and we were able to find information on their turnover. We have found that the charge will be more than 0.5% of their turnover and therefore we conclude that there may be a negative impact.</p>

<h4>Not found</h4>

<p>These are licence holders that we were not able to find as registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Results</h3>

<p>The following tables show the results of the draft impact assessment. In total, we sampled 521 of the remaining 1,739 licence holders, focussing especially on the largest increases.</p>

<p>It is important to note here that while some of these increase percentages seem very large, in terms of actual monetary increase they are often small.</p>

<p>The first table shows the number of companies in every charge increase band and the number we sampled from each category. Overall, we sampled 30% of all licence holders.</p>

<p>As the results show we could not find any registration for just over a quarter of the companies in the sample. These are mostly small farms that are probably family businesses and are not registered with Companies House as they belong to individuals.</p>

<p>Over a third of the companies in the sample has been identified as small companies, but since we do not have any information on their financial statements we cannot assess the impact. It is possible that there will be some negative impact on them. Only 2 companies were identified as <abbr title="small, medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr> and were likely to experience some negative impact from the increase in charges.</p>

<p>Over a third of the sample is either a large, dormant or dissolved company that will not see any significant impact from the increases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Agricultural sector – small farms income analysis</h2>

<p>As shown in the impact analysis above, financial information on individual farms is very difficult to obtain as it is often not published. In order to get a better understanding of potential impacts and the affordability of our charges for farmers we looked at other publicly available information on farming income.</p>

<p>In 2017, before the Environment Agency Strategic Review of Charges, the Environment Agency commissioned Risk and Policy Analysts to do a study<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> looking at the impacts of changes in charges on the different sectors we regulate, including agriculture. We wanted to gain an understanding of the sectors, their structure and the possible impacts. The Environment Agency classification does not mirror the Standard Industry Classification (<abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr>), therefore the information that we get is more general, but it still gives us an overview of the sector. The relevant information from this study is summarised in Section 4.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Agriculture – sector information</h3>

<p>The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector includes the following <abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr> codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A01: Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities</li>
  <li>A02: Forestry and logging</li>
  <li>A03: Fishing and aquaculture</li>
</ul>

<p>Table 5 presents the number of enterprises within the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector by 2 digit <abbr title="Standard Industry Classification">SIC</abbr> code. The majority of enterprises are categorised within the sub-sector ‘Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities’ – this sub-sector represents over 95% of the total number of enterprises within the sector.</p>

<p>There is a series of statistics on the economics of agricultural and other land management activities across England. These data sets provide both sectoral level indicators linked to the aggregate agricultural accounts and then indicators at an enterprise level.</p>

<p>At the sectoral level, aggregate agricultural accounts are produced by the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) and designed as a tool for analysing the economic situation of agriculture and to support policy making. They include the aggregate income of the agriculture sector, known as Total Income from Farming (<abbr title="Total Income from Farming">TIFF</abbr>), a measure of the performance of the whole agricultural industry. <abbr title="Total Income from Farming">TIFF</abbr> is the income generated by production within the agriculture industry and represents business profits plus remuneration for work done by owners and other unpaid workers or Gross Value Added (<abbr title="Gross Value Added">GVA</abbr>) after deduction of consumption of fixed capital, taxes, labour costs, interest and rent but including all subsidies).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> <abbr title="Gross Value Added">GVA</abbr> does not reflect the distribution of income across individual farms. However, it does reflect the contribution that farming makes to the national economy; it is not considered as strong an indicator as <abbr title="Total Income from Farming">TIFF</abbr> for the purposes of this study.</p>

<p>By number of employees, most are micro enterprises but the stratification by turnover is quite split for the lower turnover size bands, up to the level of £249,000. This would suggest that there is not a typical farm.</p>

<p>One of the key sources of agricultural statistics at the firm level is the Farm Business Survey (<abbr title="Farm Business Survey">FBS</abbr>). The <abbr title="Farm Business Survey">FBS</abbr> provides information on the physical and economic performance of farm businesses in England, to inform policy decisions on matters affecting the farming sector. The level of Farm Based Income is highly dependent on the type of farming, with grazing and livestock being the least profitable of all types. There are large numbers of small firms undertaking a range of different productive activities having different economic values. Levels of economic performance can vary widely. Information in the <abbr title="Farm Business Survey">FBS</abbr> is very detailed and in order to make use of it we would have to have much more information on our licence holders than we could find. We therefore could not use it in our analysis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Analysis</h3>

<p>The results of our impact assessment in Section 3 do not allow us to draw any robust conclusions on the impacts on the agricultural sector since many of the licence holders in the ‘agriculture’ and in the ‘companies’ categories are not found or no information is available. Therefore, we have included a second layer of analysis here based on the distribution of farm turnover in table 8 in Section 4.1.</p>

<p>In order to get a further understanding of potential impacts we did some further analysis based on the assumption that our licence holders follow the same distribution.</p>

<p>The table below shows the distribution of the licence holders according to turnover. This analysis includes all the licence holders in the ‘agriculture’ category but also the ones in the ‘companies’ and ‘limited companies’ category that have agriculture as one of their activities even though they could not be decisively identified as a farming business.</p>

<p>We looked at the average increases in charges for the three categories and the average new charge they would be paying in order to assess the impact for the companies in each turnover band described above. For the ‘companies’ and ‘limited companies’ categories, we use the average for the companies included in Table 9 above, not for the whole category. Since there were no companies in the ‘companies’ category that fit the description the total is zero, but we still include the category for the purposes of the analysis.</p>

<p>Obviously, the companies with turnover in the two upper bands (over £1 million and over £5 million) will not see an impact, since the average charge is not more than £1,020. We therefore exclude them from the analysis. The table below shows the potential impact for the licence holders in each turnover band.</p>

<p>We chose the midpoint of each turnover band to estimate the charge or turnover.</p>

<p>The results show that the average increase will have a high impact on ‘agriculture’ and ‘limited companies’ in the lowest turnover band (less than £50,000). These are 261 companies in total out of 913 (28%) of the companies in this group.</p>

<p>This estimate uses average increases where in reality median increase might be more appropriate as there are a few very large increases that influence the average. It is also a conservative estimate as we use the midpoint of the turnover bands.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Water companies – impact on customer bills</h2>

<p>The majority of the charge increases will be paid by the water company sector. There are 15 water companies holding 1,387 licences that are facing total increase in charges of £31,281,379.</p>

<p>The average increase per licence is £22,500. This shows that although the total amount paid is large mainly because of the number of licences held by water companies, the actual increase in terms of percentage are not that large in comparison with other categories.</p>

<p>In addition, water companies are companies with large turnovers, so the increase in charges will not have a significant impact on them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Application charges – hydropower sector</h2>

<p>The impact of increases in application charges cannot be assessed in the same way as that of subsistence charges. This is because application charges are primarily a one-off rather than an ongoing cost and the potential impact is on the decision of new companies whether to enter the market.</p>

<p>As part of the review, all applications will see a significant charge increase as the charging scheme moves to full cost recovery instead of artificially low historical application fees. This analysis however will focus on the hydropower sector as they are the only ones that are facing an increase only on the application charges (that is, they do not pay subsistence fees).</p>

<p>Based on the last 3 years of application data agricultural licences have made up 60% of the applications, followed by industrial, commercial and public service (10%), water supply (9%) and hydropower (7%).</p>

<p>The proposed application fees change from the £1,500 flat application fee to a range of fees starting from £6,110 and up to £13,392. The exact amount of the fee varies depending on the size of the hydropower scheme but also on the risk. The table below shows the range of the charges for the different categories.</p>

<p>In addition to the application fees, the table describes the different terms renewal, normal and substantial variation fees that would be applicable if changes are required to the permit after it has been issued.</p>

<p>Supplementary charges are possible in addition to this, for example charges to cover the costs of additional public participation in ‘high public interest’ applications, costs of advertising and costs associated with the assessment of impacts on protected habitats and species.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The impact of the increase on the decision of a new company to enter the market can be assessed in comparison to the other costs of starting a new hydropower plant.</p>

<p>In order to understand the type and scale of costs faced by a new hydropower plant we have looked into the sector using publicly available sources of information such as Statista, the British Hydropower Association (<abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>), Renewables First and others.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> The hydropower sector</h3>

<p>Statista records there being a total of 1,561 plants/schemes generating hydroelectricity at the end of 2020. According to the website The Switch there was a 10% increase in hydropower electricity generation between 2016 and 2017. The industry turnover was £639m in 2016 and there were 7,400 (BIS, 2015) hydro jobs.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>A hydropower scheme usually has an 80-year lifetime. In quarter 3, 2020, hydropower contributed 1.6% and quarter 3, 2021, hydropower contributed 1.0%, of total energy production in the UK.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> Currently, there is an installed capacity of 1,676 MW generating over 5,000 GW/year in the UK, in addition to a further 2860 MW capacity of existing pumped storage (<abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>, 2019).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are 2 sub-sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>micro-hydro power (less than 50 kW capacity)</li>
  <li>hydro power plants (more than 50 kW)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Sector costs</h3>

<p>According to the <abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>, on average, 70% of the cost of a new hydropower scheme in the UK goes into civil construction, which is procured locally. The majority of new small schemes are in remote rural areas.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Hydropower shows the lower cost per kW of clean energy of all renewable technologies over the full lifetime of the scheme (<abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>, 2019).</p>

<p>The main costs of setting up and running a hydropower scheme are as follows.</p>

<h4>Capital costs</h4>

<p>These include turbines, drives, generators, valves, controls, pipe costs, welding works, civil works to create the intake, screens, pipeline, and the turbine house, electrical works within the turbine house plus transformer if required, connection costs, including any upgrading of the Grid if required, any new access tracks and routes to the abstraction point, design and licence fees.</p>

<p>Grid connection is arranged by operators with the local Distribution Network Operator (<abbr title="Distribution Network Operator">DNO</abbr>). Large schemes may connect directly to the Transmission Network (<abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>). The costs of grid connection are site-specific and depend on: <abbr title="Distribution Network Operator">DNO</abbr>, connection voltage, physical location and access to the network, network capacity and availability, upgrade requirement, and generation technology (<abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>).</p>

<h4>Running costs</h4>

<p>The running costs of a hydro power scheme are business rates, insurance, operation and maintenance, and replacement of key parts after approximately 10 to 5 years (<abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>).</p>

<p>For some perspective on likely costs of schemes, we found the following statements.</p>

<p>“For a £250,000 one-off cost [for example, Torrs Hydro New Mills Scheme] you can power seventy homes for twenty-five years” Steve Welsh, managing director of H2ope - <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.merseybasin.org.uk/archive/assets/134/original/Weir-ed%5C_and%5C_Wonderful.pdf" rel="external">Weir-ed and Wonderful</a>, also: “you won’t find any massive schemes like in Scotland, but the government is pushing for distributed energy rather than centrally produced, so there is an opportunity for schemes dotted around the country to make their own contribution”</p>

<p>“The installed cost of small hydro projects usually lies in the range of £2,000 to £3,500 per kilowatt, although refurbishments of derelict sites can be considerably cheaper than this. With the current price in excess of 5.5p/kWh being offered for hydro-electricity (depending on length of contract), a scheme installed for £2,500/kW with a 60 per cent capacity factor can expect to pay back in around ten years, whereas the lifetime of small hydro projects should exceed 50 years with proper maintenance” <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to the <abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr>, the minimum cost of a hydropower scheme is £35,000. Smaller sites can cost £8,000 per kW capacity, whereas larger systems might cost around £4,000 per kW capacity, although the cost is site-dependant.</p>

<p>Estimations extracted from Renewables First.</p>

<p>According to the Renewables First website the costs of a typical hydro project of different sizes are shown in the table below. The table shows that the vast majority of the cost – ranging from 89% to 98% of the total – is the cost of installation and construction. The feasibility stage is the smallest cost, while the planning and environmental consent ranges from 2% to 8% of the total for the smallest schemes. We could not find information on how much of that can be attributed to the application fees.</p>

<p>The costs presented in Table 6.2 are similar to those quotes by the <abbr title="British Hydropower Association">BHA</abbr> and other sources. We have therefore used them in the analysis of the impact described in Section 6.3</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Impact of application charges</h3>

<p>In order to understand the impact of the change in the charges we need to calculate the change as a proportion of the overall costs to set up a hydropower scheme. First, we looked at the number and type of applications we are likely to receive. The numbers listed in table 6.4 are predicted numbers based on the profile of applications over the last few years.</p>

<p>In order to assess the impact, we have calculated the additional costs that applicants will face as a result of the increase in charge (Table 6.6). The additional costs are the difference between the new proposed fee and the current £1,500 fee. We have then calculated the increase as a percentage of the total costs as shown in Table 6.5. The percentages are calculated for the top and the middle of each cost range in order to understand the average and the maximum impact.</p>

<p>The results show that while for the majority of the applicants the increases in the charges will not have a significant impact using both average and maximum costs for their category, for the smallest schemes (0 to 15kW) the additional charge will represent between 5% and 11% of the total costs. This category represents just under a third (28%) of the applications and approximately 3 applications per year. This is a significant proportion of the total costs and individuals may reconsider setting up small hydropower schemes.</p>

<p>For the larger schemes, over 50kW, the additional charge is a small proportion of the total costs, ranging from 0.1% to 5%. The most applications will fall in the 100 to 500kW category (35%) where the impacts are negligible. Therefore, the additional charge is not considered to be a barrier for the larger schemes.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the assessment shows that for the smaller hydropower schemes, the change in the application fees represents a significant proportion of the total costs of the scheme. In addition, the application fees have to be paid in advance before any finance is agreed for the construction of the schemes, which means that if the application for finance is rejected then the companies or individuals are facing the loss of the applications fees. Combined with the increase in the level of the charge, this can prove to be more of a disincentive for the small and possibly some of the medium schemes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Economic impact conclusions</h2>

<p>The draft impact assessment identified that around a third of the companies in our sample are small companies. With some exceptions, we cannot assess the impact of the changes on these companies without obtaining further details of their financial situation.</p>

<p>The lack of financial information on more than half of the companies in our sample has not allowed us to draw robust conclusions on the impacts of the charge increases on these licence holders. It is important that the consultation draws out and tests any potential impact on these licence holders.</p>

<p>For the licence holders and companies, we have information on, most of the charge increases are not seen as significant in actual £ terms, even though they can be large % increases. The impact of the increases therefore should be insignificant for the majority of the licence holders. Water companies do see a large actual increase in charges but the overall proportion of water abstraction charges they pay to the Environment Agency remains at 90%. In addition, water companies are companies with large turnovers, so we anticipate that the increase in charges will not have a significant impact on them.</p>

<p>We are able to conclude that for 38% of those we are able to analyse there will be a change in the charges the companies pay, but these charges will not have a negative impact on those companies. These are licence holders with increases of less than £50 and all increases up to 20% are not expected to have any material impact on the finances of the companies.</p>

<p>Our further analysis of the agriculture sector highlighted impacts for less than a third of the farms. This analysis is based on assumption around the turnover of the companies, so further work to explore this with licence holders during the consultation is needed to make it more robust.</p>

<p>As described, a desk based study is limited in terms accessible information. It is therefore important that the consultation draws out and tests any potential impact on sectors and licence holders.</p>
