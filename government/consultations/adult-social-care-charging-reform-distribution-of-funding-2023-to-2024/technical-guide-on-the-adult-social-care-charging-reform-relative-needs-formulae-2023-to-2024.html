<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) announced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/build-back-better-our-plan-for-health-and-social-care">reform to the adult social care charging system</a> in September 2021. This includes a new adult social care charging reform framework from October 2023 with increases in capital limits and a cap on personal care costs. The reform package includes £3.6 billion over 3 years to reform the adult social care charging system and enable local authorities to move towards paying providers a fair cost of care.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/adult-social-care-charging-reform-distribution-of-funding-2023-to-2024">public consultation seeking views on proposals for distributing funding for the delivery of adult social care charging reform in 2023 to 2024</a>. The proposals include various formulae for distributing the funding. These distribution formulae aim to divide a grant or budget between different local authorities according to the distribution of need for that grant or budget.</p>

<p>This technical guide sets out the distribution formulae and data sources used for the allocations in the consultation. This includes the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>-commissioned distribution formulae from the Adult Social Care Research Unit (<abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>) at the Personal Social Services Research Unit (<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr>) at the University of Kent. In addition, this guide includes the distribution formulae that made use of the Office for National Statistics’ (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) estimates of the care home self-funding population, and information relating to people aged under 65 for distributing the charging reform funding in 2023 to 2024. These relative needs formulae were specifically developed to account for additional needs of local authorities due to charging reform.</p>

<p>The following gives a summary of the consultation proposals for different charging reform funding streams in 2023 to 2024.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The extension of the means test and the cap on care cost</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> developed 2 formulae to predict the additional relative needs from the extension to the means test.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> One formula is focused on people aged 65 and over and the other is for adults aged under 65. We are proposing to use the formula for adults aged under 65 to distribute funding for the cap. Both models use small area and individual level data and analysis. Please see below and the <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> report, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ascru.nihr.ac.uk/reports" rel="external">Relative need formula allocation of additional funding to local authorities to meet social care charging reforms</a>, for further technical details.</p>

<p>For adults aged under 65, we also present an additional relative needs distribution formula used for allocations based on the distribution of the 18 to 64 population.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> means test extension formula for people aged 65 and over, 2022</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> specifically designed a formula to predict the relative size of the new public expenditure required for the extension of the means test for adults aged 65 and over. The formula uses available data regarding care needs, income and wealth, and unpaid care to estimate the relative needs of local authorities.</p>

<p>The formula modelling uses information on individual characteristics (including on income and assets) of people aged 65 and over with care needs from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (<abbr title="English Longitudinal Study of Ageing">ELSA</abbr>), and data on utilisation under the pre-reform system in small areas. A combination of individual and small area level analyses are used as part of the modelling. It includes intermediate steps that estimate the relative additional number of people with care needs expected to become eligible for local authority support with their care costs due to the means test extension. This distribution in care homes is correlated with the distribution of self-funding people by local authority as reported by the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> estimates.</p>

<p>As well as residential care, the formula also includes a community setting element, which was not the case when the formula was originally developed in 2013 to 2014.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> This means it can better capture the relative needs of local authorities due to the capital limit changes</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> means test extension formula for people aged 65 and over is as follows.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<p>multiplied by the projected population aged 65 and over.</p>
</div>

<p>Each local authority’s allocation share is calculated as their formula result divided by the sum of the formula results for all 152 councils with adult social services responsibilities (<abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr>). The allocation amount for each local authority is calculated by multiplying a national quantum of funding by each local authority’s allocation share. See Annex A of the consultation for illustrative allocations. Data sources are set out in section 4.</p>

<p>No area cost adjustment (<abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>) is applied because the formula modelling already incorporates the regional unit costs when estimating the relative size of new public expenditure.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> means test extension formula for people aged 18 to 64</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> developed a formula for the distribution of funding for the extension to the means test for people aged 18 to 64. There is limited data especially around care needs and income or wealth for people aged 18 to 64. Therefore, this formula is a simplified version of the modelling done for the extensions to the means test formula for adults aged 65 and over. The model predicts the relative size of the new public expenditure required for the extension of the means test for adults aged 65 and over first, and then uses a simpler 2-variable formula to measure the needs and wealth effects. Assuming the same need and wealth effects for younger adults, the <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> developed a younger adult formula using proxy need and wealth variables related to younger adults to better reflect their positions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> means test extension formula for people aged 18 to 64 is as follows.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The sum of:</p>

<p>0.2655 plus</p>

<p>3.5299 multiplied by the number of people aged 16 to 64 claiming personal independence payments per person aged 16 to 64, plus</p>

<p>3.2234 multiplied by the number of homeowner households aged 25 to 64 per census households aged 25 to 64</p>

<p>multiplied by the projected population aged 18 to 64.</p>
</div>

<p>Each local authority’s allocation share is calculated as their formula result divided by the sum of the formula results for all 152 <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr>. The allocation amount for each local authority is calculated by multiplying a national quantum of funding by each local authority’s allocation share. See Annex A of the consultation for illustrative allocations. Data sources are set out in section 4.</p>

<p>No <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> is applied because the formula modelling already incorporates the regional unit costs when estimating the relative size of new public expenditure for adults aged 65 and over.</p>

<h3>Per capita (people aged 18 to 64) distribution formula</h3>

<p>There is limited data to describe the financial situation of the population aged 18 to 64, especially those with care needs. Given the limited nature of the data available we present a simple distribution formula which does not control for variation in need or financial eligibility of this population. This method assumes that additional demand is spread evenly across the population of people aged 18 to 64 and allocates funding based on the distribution of people aged 18 to 64 in each local authority.</p>

<p>The per capita (people aged 18 to 64) distribution formula for the extension to the means test for people aged 18 to 64 is as follows.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Projected number of people aged 18 to 64 multiplied by the area cost adjustment.</p>

<p>Each local authority’s allocation share is calculated as their formula result divided by the sum of the formula results for all 152 <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr>.

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Implementation and additional assessments</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> produced 2 formulae designed to predict the relative demand for new assessments resulting from charging reform. Both formulae calculate additional assessments as the difference between the estimated total number of people seeking assessments post-reform and the number already assessed. Both also take the number of people already assessed to equal the current number of local authority supported people accessing care.</p>

<p>Two different approaches, either a utilisation or normative (needs proxy) based approach, are taken to quantify the number of assessments. The formulae modelling used small area and individual-level data and analyses. This includes using data based on the characteristics of older people, including on assets and disability, from <abbr title="English Longitudinal Study of Ageing">ELSA</abbr>. For further technical details, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ascru.nihr.ac.uk/reports" rel="external"><abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> report</a>.</p>

<p>We also present a third distribution formula which uses the estimated self-funding residents in care homes as a proxy to the distribution of self-funding users who may come forward for an assessment under charging reform.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>- <abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> assessments formula (utilisation approach) 2022</h3>

<p>This formula uses a utilisation-based approach. This approach estimates the total demand for assessments to be equal to the number of people that would satisfy the current needs test for social care. This is estimated using small area modelling based on individual level data from <abbr title="English Longitudinal Study of Ageing">ELSA</abbr> and small area utilisation data.</p>

<p>At the local authority level, this potential eligible need is multiplied by the population, and then the number of people currently receiving local authority support is subtracted to estimate extra assessments to local authorities due to reform changes.</p>

<p>This approach estimates the expected number of people who would pass a needs eligibility assessment in the current system using statistical modelling. However, there are uncertainties associated with these estimates. In addition, this approach might underestimate additional assessments from people with a lower level of need, which varies locally.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> utilisation approach assessments formula is as follows.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>- <abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> assessments formula (normative approach) 2022</h3>

<p>The second <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> assessments formula is based on a normative approach, which calculates the total demand for assessments using an estimate for ‘potential eligible need’. This is measured by the number of people in the population with 3 or more activities of daily living (<abbr title="activities of daily living">ADLs</abbr>) difficulties such as washing, dressing and feeding.</p>

<p>At the local authority level, this potential eligible need is multiplied by the population and then the number of people currently receiving local authority support is subtracted to estimate the number of extra assessments to local authorities due to reform changes.</p>

<p>This approach offers a more expansive and uniform definition of need which is not tied to the current needs-eligibility test. Focusing on a person’s <abbr title="activities of daily living">ADL</abbr> difficulties (rather than potential care services used), it is not affected by the availability of unpaid care. Data on <abbr title="activities of daily living">ADLs</abbr> is not routinely available, and so this is estimated using data from <abbr title="English Longitudinal Study of Ageing">ELSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Adult Social Care Research Unit">ASCRU</abbr>-<abbr title="Personal Social Services Research Unit">PSSRU</abbr> normative approach assessments formula is as follows.</p>

<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> estimates of the number of self-funders</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/socialcare/articles/carehomesandestimatingtheselffundingpopulationengland/2021to2022" rel="external">The <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> published estimates of the number of self-funding care home residents in England on 30 May 2022</a>. We used information from this report to estimate the number of self-funders in 2021 to 2022 in care homes by local authority. This self-funder distribution represents another option as a basis for distributing the implementation and assessment funding. This is because the charging framework changes will generate additional demand for assessments from existing self-funders with care and support needs. This method assumes that the uptake of assessments among self-funding users is the same across local authorities.</p>

<p>This method uses the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> estimates of the local authority level proportions of self-funded care home residents and the number of Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) registered care home beds at the local authority level. The <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> estimates used information from the provider information returns (PIR) collected by <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> in 2021 to 2022, which includes information on the number of care home residents who self-fund their care. As the data used by <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> was collected in 2021 to 2022, the estimates would include some effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The 30 May 2022 <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> publication estimates only cover residential care settings, not care provided in the community. Therefore, this method assumes that the relative patterns of self-funder distribution for community care settings is the same as in residential settings, an assumption with limited evidence. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/socialcare/bulletins/estimatingthesizeoftheselffunderpopulationinthecommunityengland/2021to2022" rel="external">The <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> published estimates of self-funders in the community in July 2022</a>. However, we have not used these estimates in our allocation calculations due to a combination of quality issues mentioned in the publication, and because the underlying data only includes the location of the community care providers not the people supported by the services.</p>

<p>The assessments formula using the distribution of self-funded care home residents based on the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> publication is as follows.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Percentage of self-funding residents in care homes multiplied by the number of CQC registered care home beds</p>

<p>multiplied by the area cost adjustment.</p>
</div>

<p>Each local authority’s allocation share is calculated as their formula result divided by the sum of the formula results for all 152 <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr>. The allocation amount for each local authority is calculated by multiplying a national quantum of funding by each local authority’s allocation share. See Annex B of the consultation for illustrative allocations. Data sources are set out in section 4.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> estimates combined some <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr> together when reporting on the proportion of the self-funded care homes residents. Where this was the case, we assumed that the proportions for the separate <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr> were the same as the combined proportion.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> report did not report percentage of self-funding residents in care homes for some <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr> due to small numbers. Values for these local authorities were suppressed on quality grounds and to avoid disclosure issues. In these local authorities we assumed the percentage of self-funding residents in care homes at local authority level is the same as the regional percentage. For the illustrative allocations in Annex B, this assumption applies to the allocations for Tower Hamlets and Westminster.</p>

<p>The City of London has no <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> registered care home beds. For this local authority a proxy value for the number of self-funding residents in care home beds was calculated as follows.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Percentage of self-funding residents in beds in care homes in region multiplied by the number of CQC registered care home beds in region per regional population (aged 18 and over)</p>

<p>multiplied by the local authority population (aged 18 and over)</p>

<p>multiplied by the area cost adjustment.</p>

<h4>Area cost adjustment</h4>

<p>The cost of delivering local government services varies across the country due to differences in the cost of labour and business rates. The <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> is a tool used to account for this variation in costs for local authorities in England.</p>

<p>Source: Department for Communities and Local Government (a predecessor of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> 2013 to 2014.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> 2013 to 2014, there have been changes to some <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr>. We made the following assumptions regarding the <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> of the <abbr title="councils with adult social services responsibilities">CASSRs</abbr> with updated geographies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole unitary authority (April 2019) has an&nbsp;<abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>&nbsp;of 1 as their predecessor councils of Bournemouth, Poole, and Dorset County Council all had an&nbsp;<abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>&nbsp;of 1</li>
  <li>Dorset unitary authority (April 2019) has an <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>&nbsp;of 1 as its predecessor CASSR Dorset County Council had an&nbsp;<abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>&nbsp;of 1</li>
  <li>North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire (April 2021) both have an <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> of 1.0077 as their predecessor council of Northamptonshire County Council had an <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> of 1.0077 and we have assumed there is no variation in costs between North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire</li>
