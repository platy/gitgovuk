<p>The following is to explain your rights and give you the information you are entitled to under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (“the Data Protection Legislation”). This notice only refers to your personal data (e.g. your name, email address, and anything that could be used to identify you personally) not the content of your response to the survey.</p>

<h2>The identity of the data controller and contact details of our Data Protection Officer.</h2>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (“DCMS”) is the data controller. The Data Protection Officer can be contacted at dcmsdataprotection@culture.gov.uk. You can find out more on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport/about/personal-information-charter">Personal Information Charter page</a>.</p>

<h2>Why we are collecting your personal data.</h2>

<p>Your personal data is being collected as an essential part of the consultation process, so that we can contact you regarding your response and for statistical purposes such as to ensure individuals cannot complete the survey more than once.</p>

<h2>Our legal basis for processing your personal data.</h2>

<p>The Data Protection Legislation states that, as a government department, the department may process personal data as necessary for the effective performance of a task carried out in the public interest. i.e. a consultation.</p>

<h2>With whom we will be sharing your personal data.</h2>

<p>Registered suppliers, relevant local bodies, other government departments and local and central government.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we will only disclose your information to:</p>

<p>(a) our professional advisors (including without limitation tax, legal or other corporate advisors who provide professional services to DCMS)</p>

<p>(b) regulators (including Ofcom), law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies, courts, the police and any other authorised bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity or other regulatory, legal, commercial or public matters etc.</p>

<p>The use of your personal information by third parties under (b) will be governed by such third parties’ privacy statements and policies, which you should familiarise yourself with. These parties are also “controllers”, which means they have independent obligations under the Data Protection Laws to protect your personal data and provide you with information as to how they process it (subject to certain exemptions). We also have contracts in place with these third parties to safeguard the personal information we share with them.</p>

<p>(c) other third-party suppliers for business administration or IT purposes</p>

<p>The use of your personal information by third parties under (c) is governed by this policy. We appoint these third parties on a “processor” basis, which means they are subject to contractual and legal obligations to protect your personal information in line with the Data Protection Laws, this policy and contractual obligations we have put in place with these third parties to safeguard the information we share.</p>

<p>(d) analytics or search engines, including Google that enable us to optimise and improve your website experience. For more information, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/cookies/" rel="external">our cookies policy</a>.
Copies of responses may be published after the survey closes. If we do so, we will ensure that neither you nor the organisation you represent are identifiable, and any responses used to illustrate findings will be anonymised.</p>

<p>Qualtrics is the online survey platform used to conduct this survey. They will store the data in accordance with DCMS instructions and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualtrics.com/privacy-statement/" rel="external">their privacy policy can be found online</a>.</p>

<p>If you want the information that you provide to be treated as confidential, please be aware that, under the FOIA, there is a statutory Code of Practice with which public authorities must comply and which deals, amongst other things, with obligations of confidence. In view of this, it would be helpful if you could explain to us why you regard the information you have provided as confidential. If we receive a request for disclosure of the information, we will take full account of your explanation, but we cannot give an assurance that confidentiality can be maintained in all circumstances. An automatic confidentiality disclaimer generated by your IT system will not, of itself, be regarded as binding on the Department.</p>

<h2>For how long we will keep your personal data, or criteria used to determine the retention period.</h2>

<p>Your personal data will be held for two years after the survey is closed. This is so that the department is able to contact you regarding the result of the survey following analysis of the responses.</p>

<h2>Your rights, e.g. access, rectification, erasure.</h2>

<p>The data we are collecting is your personal data, and you have considerable say over what happens to it. You have the right:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to see what data we have about you</li>
  <li>to ask us to stop using your data, but keep it on record</li>
  <li>to have all or some of your data deleted or corrected</li>
  <li>to lodge a complaint with the independent Information Commissioner (ICO) if you think we are not handling your data fairly or in accordance with the law.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/" rel="external">ICO online</a>, by telephone on 0303 123 1113 or by writing to them at ICO, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF.</p>

<h2>Your personal data will not be sent overseas.</h2>

<h2>Your personal data will not be used for any automated decision making.</h2>

<h2>Your personal data will be stored in a secure government IT system.</h2>
