<p>In April 2020 we published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877365/Technical_review_of_Approved_Document_B_workplan.pdf" rel="external">workplan for a ‘technical review’</a>  of the fire safety guidance provided in Approved Document B (ADB) and announced the intention to commission research to inform options for updating the guidance.</p>

<p>Research commissions have been put to open tender with suppliers now appointed to carry out evidence gathering or research. All workstreams and suppliers are supported by groups made up of experts representing fire safety concerns, industry, and other interested parties. The technical review progress and approach is also overseen by a working group of the Building Standards Advisory Committee (BRAC) and the main BRAC. The department is reviewing research outputs as they are received to inform possible future policy options.</p>

<p>To date, the following workstreams have been commissioned under the technical review of ADB:</p>

<p><strong>1.	Specialised housing and care homes</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: A study of current design approaches and establishing current operational, management, and usage practices across the specialised housing and care home sector. A review of the effectiveness of current provisions in ADB and consideration of international approaches. Further research into alternative approaches to fire safety in these types of buildings.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is underway with outputs being considered.</p>

<p><strong>2. Means of escape for disabled people</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: Research into whether the relevant provisions in ADB are fit for purpose, grounded in realistic expectation of management and building use, recognise up to date evidence and are effective in meeting the minimum requirements under Schedule 1 Part B1 of the Building Regulations 2010.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is underway with outputs being considered.</p>

<p><strong>3.	Balconies, spandrels and glazing</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To develop a comprehensive evidence base on modern common design approaches to balconies, spandrels and glazing, conduct a review of the fire risk from these elements and where appropriate deliver an experimental programme to develop the robust evidence required to support review of the guidance in ADB.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is currently underway.</p>

<p><strong>4.	Structural fire resistance and fire separating elements</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To assess the current provisions in ADB regarding structural fire resistance and fire-separating elements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establishing the underpinning evidence base, and reviewing in light of modern evidence on design, technology and fire loading.</li>
  <li>Investigating alternative approaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is currently underway.</p>

<p><strong>5.	Trigger heights &amp; thresholds</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To ensure that the thresholds used in the guidance are based on relevant and up to date evidence and provide adequate guidance to designers.</p>

<p>This research project is expected to identify the basis and underpinning evidence for some trigger thresholds used throughout ADB and in Regulation 7(4) of the Building Regulations 2010.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is currently underway.</p>

<p><strong>6.	Smoke and toxicity</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To provide the evidence base to assess the need and means to regulate toxicity of construction products in the event of a fire in England.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is currently underway.</p>

<p><strong>7.	Construction technologies and design</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To consider whether ADB adequately addresses common construction practice and developing technologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify and review modern construction technologies and trends in design and building use</li>
  <li>Review the current provisions in ADB considering the application of modern construction technologies and trends in design and building use</li>
</ul>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is underway with outputs being considered.</p>

<p><strong>8.	Classification of external wall construction review</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To provide a review of the current assessment methodology of the fire performance of external wall systems including a review of the BS 8414 methodology and BR 135 classification. To ensure this testing regime is fit for purpose and based on robust evidence to ensure buildings are safe and people are confident in the regulatory standards.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is currently underway.</p>

<p><strong>9.	Means of escape in blocks of flats</strong> (joint Home Office and DLUHC)</p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: Review the current evacuation strategy and design principles of means of escape in blocks of flats and ensure that they are fit for purpose.</p>

<p>This is a joint DLUHC and Home Office project divided in 4 strands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An evidence review, to assess academic evidence on methods of evacuation;</li>
  <li>Operational research, to physically test evacuation strategies and interactions with fire and rescue operations;</li>
  <li>Building design research, to evaluate fire safety provisions in buildings; and</li>
  <li>Human behaviour and public confidence, to better understand public perception and understanding of evacuation strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is currently underway and links to Home Office operational research.</p>

<p><strong>10.	Property protection</strong></p>

<p>Workstream purpose and expected outcomes: To consider how other countries approach the issue of property protection through Building Regulations or equivalent and an analysis of evidence on the costs and benefits of different regulatory approaches to property protection.</p>

<p>Current status: A supplier was appointed after open competitive tender. The project is underway with outputs being considered.</p>
