<p>Any personal data supplied by you when responding to the call for information will be processed by the Home Office in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in accordance with Home Office data protection privacy notices. The Secretary of State for the Home Department is the controller of this information.</p>

<h2>Data we are collecting</h2>

<p>We have asked respondents to provide the following information for the purposes of the call for information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the capacity in which they are responding to the call for information (individual, academic, industry representative, charity representative, other)</li>
</ul>

<p>We have asked respondents to avoid providing personal data. However, if someone responds to the online survey, we will consequently collect their IP address. If someone responds via email we will have collected their email address. It is also likely that if someone responds by email we will have collected their name and, if responding on behalf of an organisation or charity, the details of the organisation or charity they are representing; or if responding as an academic, the institution(s) to which they are affiliated. We have provided the option to submit written responses by post. We have noted that written responses will be destroyed after they have been scanned to create a digital copy. If people respond by post, we may have collected their name, personal or organisational address, and details of the organisation, charity or institution they are associated with.</p>

<p>We have invited respondents from organisations or academics to share any relevant research. If they do so, we may have collected their name, personal or organisational address, and details of the organisation, or institution they are associated with.</p>

<p>Individually or collectively, this and any other information provided in the call for information may enable a respondent to be identified.</p>

<p>We will not keep any personal data collected longer than is necessary for the purpose for which they are being processed. Your personal data will be retained for as long as necessary for the purpose of the call for information and any associated policy decisions and in accordance with the Home Office data retention policy. This policy stipulates that consultations documentation will be destroyed after five years.</p>

<h2>How and why the Home Office uses your information</h2>

<p>The purpose of the call for information is to gather views which will be used to inform future policy development.</p>

<p>During the call for information and further engagement associated with this policy development, the Home Office will engage with a wide range of external stakeholders and individuals. The Home Office collects and processes personal information including during the course of this call for information to enable it to carry out its statutory and other functions. The Home Office is only allowed to process your data where there is a lawful basis for doing so. In this case the Home Office, as a government department, may process personal data for the purpose of a public task i.e. the call for information. We consider the processing to be necessary for the performance of this task carried out in the public interest.</p>

<p>The personal data collected will assist to understand the views of respondents and to see if there are significant differences between types of respondents and to assist future policy development. We may illustrate findings through quotes provided to the call for information. We will ensure these are appropriately anonymised and do not include any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We may publish high-level analysis, including breakdowns by the data we collect and the organisations who have responded, but not individuals, in the government response to this call for information. This will help us and those reading the government response to understand how views differ across different groups.</p>

<h2>How we will process your personal data</h2>

<p>We will not publish IP or email addresses, or any personal information inadvertently provided in the responses. The Home Office will process your information in accordance with data protection legislation and the Home Office Personal Information Charter.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this call for information, the Home Office will not share your information with other organisations, apart from those processing personal data on its behalf. Where such processing is undertaken outside the EEA, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure that your rights in relation to data protection will not be compromised by this.</p>

<p>Your personal data will not be used for any automated decision making.</p>

<p>More information about how the Home Office looks after your personal information can be found at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter</a>.</p>

<h2>Storing your information</h2>

<p>Your personal information will be held on a secure government IT system for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it is being processed and in line with departmental retention policy, which stipulates that consultations documentation will be destroyed after five years. More details of this policy can be found via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter</a></p>

<h2>Your rights in relation to your personal data</h2>

<p>In accordance with Article 15-22 of the GDPR you have the right of subject access to your personal data, right to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, objection to processing as well as the right to data portability. Further details can be found in the Home Office <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">Personal Information Charter</a>.</p>
