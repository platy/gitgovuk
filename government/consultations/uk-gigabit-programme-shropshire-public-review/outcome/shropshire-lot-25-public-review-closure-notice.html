<p>New procurement to extend coverage of gigabit-capable broadband across the Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin  region.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government’s ambition is to deliver nationwide gigabit-capable broadband as soon as possible. We recognise that there is a need for government intervention in the parts of the country that are not commercially viable; this is why the government has committed £5bn for the hardest to reach parts of the country, ensuring that all areas of the UK can benefit. This will be spent through a package of coordinated and mutually supportive interventions, collectively known as Project Gigabit.</p>

<p>We wish to work collaboratively with industry to maximise efficiency, minimise market distortion and achieve our objectives within a tight time frame. To do this, we first identified the areas that were not commercially viable through the Open Market Review (OMR) and Public Review (PR) stages. This allowed us to understand from suppliers if there were any current or planned investments over the next three years in broadband infrastructure (Next Generation Access broadband, ultrafast and gigabit-capable) in the identified geography. For this Lot, the identified geography lay within Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin region.</p>

<p>The box below shows the order of processes, from OMR to procurement.</p>

<li>
<p>Determine intervention areas for procurement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procurement</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Through these stages, BDUK classifies premises as eligible/ineligible for subsidy on the basis of their existing or planned qualifying broadband infrastructure. Details on the classification system of White, Grey, Black and Under Review and methodology can be found in section 3.2. ‘BDUK Classifications &amp; methodology for this PR’.</p>

<p>Premises categorised as White by BDUK during Open Market Reviews and Public Reviews (ie eligible for subsidy) are grouped into Intervention Areas (IAs). IAs list those premises that will be targeted for subsidy in any potential procurement to follow this PR. To be clear, not all eligible premises may have been targeted for subsidy. The finalised IA will be issued to the market at the ITT stage of procurement so that suppliers can bid for subsidy to support delivery to this Intervention Area. Further information on the OMR/PR process and how we reach our conclusions can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027053/_External__-_Subsidy_Control_Guidance_-_OMR_PR_-_Subsidy_Control_Classification_Guidance__.docx__2_.pdf" rel="external">Subsidy Control Guidance document</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Outcome of the preceding Open Market Review</h2>

<p>Preceding the current Public Review stage, BDUK conducted an OMR for Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin (Lot 25) from 25 March 2021 - 22 April 2021. This OMR requested information from suppliers regarding current and planned broadband infrastructure within the next three years.</p>

<p>All meaningful responses to the OMR were considered and where necessary utilised to determine eligible premises. Suppliers who responded to the OMR were informed of the classifications applied to the existing and planned infrastructure relevant to their submission.</p>

<p>The key findings of the OMR are presented in the postcode-level map showing eligible premises identified through the OMR. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1011909/Shropshire_OMR_Postcode_Output.ods" rel="external">List of eligible postcodes</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Outcome of the Public Review</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Background</h3>

<p>The PR for Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin (Lot 25) ran from 19 August 2021 - 20 September 2021. During the PR BDUK invited stakeholders (including broadband infrastructure operators, internet service providers, the public, and businesses) to provide feedback regarding which areas were made up of eligible premises.</p>

<p>The PR stage aimed to validate the outcome of the preceding OMR to ensure that it correctly represented the information provided by suppliers in the course of the OMR.</p>

<p>Suppliers who missed contributing to the preceding OMR, had no definitive plans and / or evidence base on which to substantiate claims at that earlier stage, or had subsequently updated their plans had a final opportunity to notify BDUK before final determinations were made on premises eligibility. All meaningful responses were carefully considered and where necessary utilised to determine eligible premises. BDUK also sought feedback from Shropshire and Telford Councils. The finalised postcode-level map showing eligible premises is shown in Annex A of this Public Review Closure Note. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054075/Lot25_PR_Outcome_Postcode_Map.png" rel="external">Downloadable version of post-code level map</a>.</p>

<p>A finalised <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054076/Lot25_PR_Outcome_Postcode_List.ods">list of postcodes</a> showing the White, Grey, Black and Under review postcodes following the Public review outcome has been published. A list of eligible (white / Under Review) premises is available to suppliers upon request.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>BDUK Classifications and methodology for this PR</h3>

<p>During the PR, BDUK categorised premises as gigabit White, Grey, Black or Under Review (WGBU).</p>

<p>Subsidy control classifications are set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>White - indicates premises with no gigabit network infrastructure and none is likely to be developed within 3 years<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Grey - indicates premises where a single qualifying gigabit infrastructure from a single supplier is available or is to be deployed within the coming 3 years<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>Black - premises with two or more qualifying gigabit infrastructures from different suppliers being available, or will be deployed within the coming 3 years<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>Under Review - indicates premises where suppliers have reported current or planned commercial broadband coverage, but where claimed current gigabit coverage has not been verified, or, in respect of planned build, where evaluators are confident that gigabit infrastructure will be delivered, but some risks to delivery remain, or there are some gaps in evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>BDUK will only provide subsidy to target premises that have been designated as White. Premises which have been designated as Under Review may be included within the Deferred Scope of a procurement. Where this is the case, a further review will be undertaken to confirm whether they are Grey or White before they are released for build.</p>

<p>In accordance with the OMR / PR processes, supplier data submitted during the OMR and PR has been mapped using a methodology that protects commercially sensitive supplier data. To reflect this sensitivity, postcode level maps only are provided in this document and we will only release White and Under Review UPRNs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Summary of PR findings - premises eligibility</h3>

<p>For presentational purposes only, postcode-level mapping has been used to present maps showing eligible premises. (NB we will only subsidise build to premises which have been designated as White - postcodes are not used to determine intervention areas for subsidy). For this purpose, postcodes have been classified as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>White</strong> if any White premises are present</li>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>Under Review</strong> if any Under Review premises are present</li>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>Black</strong> if all premises in the postcode are classified Black</li>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>Grey</strong> ie all premises are Grey or a mixture of Grey and Black</li>
</ol>

<p>A postcode-level map summarising these premise classifications is provided in Annex A. Suppliers - please note that these maps do not show which UPRNs have been determined as White and Under Review.</p>

<p>The outcome of the Public Review is summarised in terms of White, Grey, Black and Under Review postcodes and premises below:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A key output for the OMR/PR for Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin (Lot 25) is the maps showing premises that are eligible for subsidy. From these maps, BDUK is to develop Intervention Areas to be proposed to the market during the PPME phase. Annex A sets out these maps at a postcode level. These identify the areas where premises are eligible for subsidy. A full list of White and Under Review UPRNs is available on request to Suppliers via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukgigabit@BDUK.Zendesk.com">ukgigabit@BDUK.Zendesk.com</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Annex A – Map indicating locations of eligible premises</h2>

<p>The below postcode level map indicates areas where those premises eligible for subsidy are located ie White areas. These eligible premises may be included within the Intervention Area. Black, Grey and Blue (Under Review) areas indicate where those premises ineligible for Subsidy are located.</p>
