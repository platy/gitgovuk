<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3022" rel="external">Health and Care Bill</a>, currently going through parliament sets out some changes to the water fluoridation legislation in England. If it becomes law, the Bill will allow the Secretary of State, instead of local authorities, to establish new water fluoridation schemes or to vary or terminate existing water fluoridation schemes in England.</p>

<p>In the event that the Bill is passed, there will be a legal duty on the Secretary of State to undertake a formal public consultation before introducing any new water fluoridation schemes or before varying or terminating an existing scheme. Secondary legislation will need to set out the process for consulting and the results from this consultation will inform that secondary legislation.</p>

<h2>What fluoride is</h2>

<p>Fluoride is a mineral that occurs naturally in the environment – it is found in drinking water and seawater, in the soil and in certain foods. When combined with other minerals, fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, reducing the risk of tooth decay. The addition of fluoride to toothpaste has contributed over the last few decades to an improvement in dental health in England.</p>

<h2>What a fluoridation scheme is</h2>

<p>A water fluoridation scheme is where additional fluoride is added to the drinking water supply with the purpose of reducing tooth decay. Schemes adjust the naturally occurring level of fluoride in water to the ideal concentration known to reduce tooth decay. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/56/contents" rel="external">Water Industry Act</a> which provides the legal basis for water fluoridation schemes in England sets a target of 1 milligram of fluoride per litre of water for a water fluoridation scheme.</p>

<p>There is good scientific evidence that fluoride is effective in reducing tooth decay for both adults and children. Research also shows that there is no convincing evidence of health harms from water fluoridation schemes. Water fluoridation is widely supported including by the World Health Organization and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-fluoridation-statement-from-the-uk-chief-medical-officers/statement-on-water-fluoridation-from-the-uk-chief-medical-officers">Chief Medical Officers for the UK</a>.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State is under a legal duty to monitor the effects on health of water fluoridation schemes in England and to publish a report every 4 years. The latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-fluoridation-health-monitoring-report-for-england-2022">water fluoridation: health monitoring report</a> published on 21 March 2022 continues to show that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health intervention to help reduce tooth decay.</p>

<h2>Areas with water fluoridation schemes</h2>

<p>After discovering that fluoride helps to reduce levels of dental decay, the first schemes to add fluoride to public water supplies were introduced in the United States of America (USA) and Canada in 1945. Pilot schemes in the United Kingdom (UK) were introduced in the 1950s, followed by permanent schemes, starting with Birmingham in 1964.</p>

<p>Some 6 million people already live in areas with water fluoridation schemes, including many in parts of the North East, as well as the West and East Midlands. There are also water supplies in England, serving around a quarter of a million people, where fluoride is naturally at similar levels to those seen in water fluoridation schemes.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/147064/fig_1_fluoride_map.png"></div></figure>

<p>The map above shows fluoridation schemes in and around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Birmingham</li>
  <li>Crewe</li>
  <li>Lincoln and Scunthorpe</li>
  <li>Newcastle upon Tyne</li>
  <li>Workington</li>
</ul>

<p>And naturally occurring fluoride levels greater than 0.5 milligrams per litre near:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bath</li>
  <li>Cambridge and Norwich</li>
  <li>Newbury</li>
  <li>Newcastle upon Tyne</li>
</ul>

<p>Other countries with water fluoridation schemes today include the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Spain and Brazil. There are an additional 50 million people, worldwide, consuming water with naturally occurring fluoride at or around the same level used in fluoridation schemes.</p>

<h2>Future consultation</h2>

<p>Public consultation will continue to be an important part of any future water fluoridation proposals.</p>

<p>Under current legislation local authorities have had responsibility for consulting on water fluoridation proposals. These have always been held at local level with individuals who would be directly affected by any water fluoridation proposals and bodies with an interest.</p>

<p>Subject to the successful passage of the Health and Care Bill, if new water fluoridation proposals were developed, we are proposing to maintain local consultation. We would only seek the views of individuals affected and bodies with an interest. The views of individuals not directly affected and bodies without an interest would not be considered. Similarly, where proposals relate to varying or terminating existing schemes, views would be sought only from those people affected and bodies with an interest.</p>

<p>We are seeking your views on this proposal and invite you to answer the consultation questions below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Consultation questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Agree</li>
  <li>Disagree</li>
  <li>Don’t know</li>
</ul>

<p>Please explain your answer</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes</li>
  <li>No</li>
  <li>Don’t know</li>
</ul>

<p>Please explain your answer</p>
