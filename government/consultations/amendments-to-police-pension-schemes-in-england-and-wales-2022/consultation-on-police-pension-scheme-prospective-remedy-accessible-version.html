<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Executive summary</h2>

<p>1.1. In April 2015 the government introduced reformed public service 
pension schemes. The changes followed a fundamental structural 
review by the Independent Public Service Pension Commission, 
chaired by Lord Hutton of Furness. As part of these changes 
protection was provided to those members who were close to 
retirement, meaning that they would be allowed to remain in their 
legacy scheme or gradually transition to the relevant reformed public 
service pension scheme. For the police pension scheme this applied to 
those within fourteen years of their normal pension age<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. This policy 
was referred to as transitional protection.</p>

<p>1.2. In December 2018, the Court of Appeal found this transitional 
protection to be discriminatory against younger members in the judicial 
and firefightersâ pension schemes, as transitional protection was only 
offered to older scheme members. The courts required that this 
unlawful discrimination be remedied by the government. The 
government accepted that this applied across all of the public sector 
pension schemes â including to the police pension scheme.</p>

<p>1.3. In order to remedy the discrimination, HM Treasury held an open 
consultation to consider the potential options to remove the 
discrimination. Following the close of the consultation in October 2020, 
it was announced in February 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> that affected members and fully protected members will receive at the point they retire a choice of which pension benefits they would prefer to receive in respect of any 
remediable service rendered between 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2022. 
This choice is whether the benefits should be modelled on the relevant 
legacy scheme or reformed scheme. This is known as the Deferred 
Choice Underpin, or âDCUâ, and the retrospective remedy. Where 
members are already receiving pensions, they will be given a choice as 
soon as practicable. In addition, from 1 April 2022, all those who 
continue in service will do so as members of the reformed schemes, 
regardless of age, meaning all members will be treated equally in terms of which pension scheme they are a member. This is known as the 
prospective remedy.</p>

<p>Individual members can have a pension age based on their length of service and linked to, but not 
necessarily dependent on, age, or they can have a pension age that depends on their rank. This 
term NPA is used here as shorthand, and for this police scheme means the different ages as used in 
the design of the original transitional protection.</p>

<p>1.4. The Public Service Pensions &amp; Judicial Offices Bill (PSPJO)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> was 
introduced to Parliament in July 2021. The Home Office as the 
Responsible Authority for the police pension scheme is now 
considering how best to implement the scheme level changes that will 
be required when the relevant provisions in the PSPJO are enacted 
and come into force. This relates to both âprospective remedyâ, 
ensuring all future accrual from 1 April 2022 is in the reformed scheme, 
and âretrospective remedyâ, enacting the Deferred Choice Underpin.</p>

<p>1.5. This consultation will address those elements of the prospective 
remedy, including moving all members to the reformed scheme (âthe 
2015 schemeâ) from 1 April 2022 and closing the legacy schemes to 
future accrual from 31 March 2022. This will mean that all members are 
treated equally in respect of any pensionable service rendered after 31 
March 2022. There will be an additional consultation in due course on 
the Deferred Choice Underpin, to address those elements of the 
remedy that will be retrospective in effect (i.e. relating to the remedy 
period, 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022).</p>

<p>1.6. The PSPJO, and the secondary legislation to be made under it, 
covering both âprospectiveâ and âretrospectiveâ phases of the remedy, 
remove the transitional protection that the Courts found to be 
discriminatory based on age; all eligible members, irrespective of age 
and proximity to NPA, will have accrued benefits in the legacy schemes 
for the remedy period (1 April 2015 - 31 March 2022).</p>

<p>This consultation will be open for views from Monday 8 November 2021 to 
Sunday 2 January 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Prospective changes to remove age discrimination</h2>

<p>2.1. In April 2015 public service pension schemes were reformed; the cost 
of the legacy schemes had significantly increased over the previous 
decades, with most of those costs falling to the taxpayer. To protect 
against unsustainable increases in costs, new schemes were 
introduced with career average revalued earnings (CARE) design and 
increased Normal Pension Ages (NPA), alongside the introduction of a 
cost control mechanism. They were also progressive, providing greater 
benefits to some lower paid workers. These are the â2015â or 
âreformedâ schemes.</p>

<p>2.2. As part of the 2015 reforms, members of the legacy schemes (i.e. 
those defined benefit pension schemes that had been introduced prior 
to 1 April 2015 for police officers), who were aged within 10 years of 
their Normal Pension Age (NPA) on 31 March 2012, were âfully 
protectedâ and allowed to remain in their legacy scheme. Members 
who, on 31 March 2012, were aged within 10 to 14 years of their NPA 
were allowed to remain in their legacy scheme for a period on a taper 
basis. Together, these protections (âfullâ and âtaperâ) were referred to 
as transitional protection.</p>

<p>2.3. In December 2018 the Court of Appeal found that transitional 
protection unlawfully discriminated against younger members of the 
judicial and firefightersâ pension schemes in particular, as it was only 
offered to older scheme members. The courts required that this 
unlawful discrimination be remedied by the government. It is important 
to note that the transitional protection element of the 2015 reforms was 
found to be discriminatory, not the reformed scheme itself.</p>

<p>2.4. In July 2019 the government confirmed that it accepted the Courtâs 
judgment had implications for the other public service schemes that 
had similar transitional arrangements, including the police pension 
scheme.</p>

<p>2.5. In July 2021 the PSPJO was introduced to Parliament, which, when 
enacted, will provide that all police officers who continue in service 
from 1 April 2022 onwards must do so as members of the reformed 
scheme. Legacy schemes (i.e. the Police Pension Scheme 1987 and 
Police Pension Scheme 2006) will be closed in relation to service after 
31 March 2022.</p>

<p>2.6. The secondary legislation to be consulted on here will allow provisions 
for the prospective remedy changes: the move of all members to the 
reformed scheme from 1 April 2022 and the closure of the legacy 
schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022 (the âProspective 
Remedyâ). This ensures that from 1 April 2022 all active members of 
the Police Pension Scheme will accrue benefits in the same scheme.</p>

<p>2.7. There will be an additional consultation on retrospective remedy, 
enacting the Deferred Choice Underpin, in due course, ahead of 
coming into force by 1 October 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Proposals to be consulted on:</h2>

<p>3.1. This consultation is on the amendments required to implement the 
Prospective Remedy, including moving all active members to the 
reformed scheme and making consequential changes to scheme 
regulations in line with the PSPJO.</p>

<p>3.2. A draft set of regulations to ensure all members accrue benefits in the 
reformed scheme from 1 April 2022 is attached to this consultation.</p>

<p>3.3. There are three areas where we are considering whether further 
amendments to the regulations may be needed, beyond those in the 
attached draft. The policy intent on those areas is set out below. When 
responding to this consultation, we ask you to presume that the draft 
regulations will reflect the policy intent as described.</p>

<h3>Policy intent</h3>

<p>3.4. Legacy scheme purchasing of additional benefits. To ensure that those 
provisions which allow arrangements for purchasing service in the 
legacy schemes by means of periodical contributions can continue 
after 31 March 2022 and that no new legacy scheme arrangements 
can be entered into after 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>3.4.i. In both police legacy pension schemes, it is possible for 
members to purchase additional pensionable service, where 
they meet certain criteria. They do this by agreement with the 
scheme manager, and pay for it either as a lump sum or by way 
of periodical contributions over a period of years, until a set age 
(typically NPA).</p>

<p>3.4.ii. All such existing agreements will remain in force after 31 March 
2022. This is because they do not involve continuing to accrue 
legacy scheme benefits in relation to service after the closing 
date; rather, the scheme members concerned are paying in 
instalments for a previously agreed enhancement to their pre-transfer service. These arrangements are therefore unaffected by the PSPJO or by our draft regulations. It should be noted that 
members will only be permitted to âcompleteâ arrangements 
entered into before 1 April 2022, subject to meeting any other 
relevant criteria (such as remaining in active service). Members 
will not be allowed to enter into arrangements to purchase additional service in the legacy schemes on or after 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>3.4.iii In order to give effect to the policy that accrual in the legacy 
schemes ceases on 31 March 2022, we are considering what 
provisions might be needed to ensure that no new arrangements 
can be entered into after 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>3.4.iv. We welcome views on whether scheme regulations would 
already achieve this without amendment.</p>

<p>3.5. Ill-health retirement (IHR). To ensure that a protected member who 
applies for IHR before 31 March 2022 where the application is 
determined in their favour after that date is treated no less favourably 
than if the application had been determined on that date.</p>

<p>3.5.i. Members who move to the reformed schemes and subsequently 
become subject to ill-health retirement from 1 April 2022 
onwards will be assessed, and receive ill-health benefits, in 
accordance with the ill-health arrangements under the reformed 
scheme provisions.</p>

<p>3.5.ii. There will be cases that will be in the process of being considered 
for ill-health retirement on the date that all active members will 
begin to accrue benefits in the reformed scheme - i.e. the ill-health 
process will begin on or before 31 March 2022 and will not 
conclude until 1 April 2022 or later.</p>

<p>3.5.iii. For any ill-health cases that straddle 1 April 2022, the intended 
policy is that if the application is approved, members will receive 
an award paid from the reformed 2015 scheme, that is no less 
generous than if the award had been determined on 31 March 
2022 under legacy scheme rules. This will mean that such 
members receive a 2015 Scheme ill-health pension calculated at 
the date they actually retire; but that if a legacy scheme ill-health 
pension calculated as at 31 March 2022 would have been higher, 
the 2015 Scheme pension must be increased by the difference 
between the two.</p>

<p>3.5.iv. We consider this policy intent may already be achieved under 
existing scheme regulations. Under the existing regulations, for 
members who make an application for ill-health retirement before 
they transition on 1 April 2022 to the reformed scheme, where that 
application is determined after the date of their transition, they will
be in no worse position than if the application had been 
determined on 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>3.5.v. This is because the existing transitional provisions in the 2015 
Regulations take account of the legacy scheme ill-health pension 
in the calculation of the one-pot ill-health benefits for transition 
members under the 2015 regulations. As well, the test for ill-health retirement eligibility for members of the reformed scheme may be no more stringent than the test that applied under the 
legacy schemes.</p>

<p>3.5.vi. These provisions currently apply in respect of âtransition 
membersâ. The changes we propose to make to the 2015 
Regulations will cause current full protection members to become 
transition members on 1 April 2022. This means that they will also 
benefit from the transitional provision on ill-health retirement 
without any specific amendment on this point.</p>

<p>3.5.vii. These provisions also ensure that all ill-health benefits to be paid 
in respect of a transition member after they transition are paid out 
of the reformed scheme, albeit in some cases subject to the same 
rules as applied under the legacy schemes.</p>

<p>3.5.viii. However, we will consider further whether any change to existing 
regulations is needed to ensure that the policy intent set out 
above is correctly achieved.</p>

<p>3.6. Interaction of retirement ages between schemes.</p>

<p>3.6.i. The legacy and 2015 police pension schemes allow a member 
to draw their pension at different ages. The 1987 scheme 
allows many members to draw their 1987 scheme pension 
before age 55. However, if they do retire before age 55, the 
rules of the 2015 scheme mean that, in relation to any pension 
accrued in the 2015 scheme only, they either have to wait until 
State Pension Age (rather than age 60) to take an unreduced 
2015 pension, or wait until the age of 55 and take an actuarily 
reduced 2015 pension (the reduction being based on State 
Pension Age). Such reduction is to reflect that the pension is 
coming into payment early and will be paid for longer.</p>

<p>3.6.ii. This is a consequence of the changes to the public sector 
pension schemes introduced in 2015, arising from the move 
from a service-based to an age-based pension scheme, and is 
what occurs under the existing regulations. We have been made 
aware of concerns that the remedy exacerbates this.</p>

<p>3.6.iii. We will give due regard to the interaction of retirement ages 
between schemes and consider whether any changes are 
needed to ensure any cohort of police pension scheme 
members are not unduly disadvantaged, especially having 
regard to the needs of members from protected groups where 
these are different from the needs of other members.</p>

<p>3.6.iv. Further work is necessary, including to understand the full 
implications of any potential change in approach to help mitigate 
this issue.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Who do we want to hear from?</h2>

<p>4.1. This consultation welcomes views from interested parties on the draft

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Questions for consultation</h2>

<p><b>Question 1</b>: As required by the PSPJO, the draft regulations seek to ensure 
that the legacy schemes are closed to future accrual from 31 March 2022 and 
that all members are in the 2015 Scheme in respect of any pensionable 
service from 1 April 2022. Are the draft regulations sufficient to meet this aim? 
Do you think there are any changes or additions required to the draft 
regulations to achieve the stated policy aims?</p>

<p><b>Question 2</b>: The government will consider whether any amendment to the 
existing 2015 Scheme regulations is required in order to ensure that a 
protected member who applies for ill health retirement before 31 March 2022, 
and which is determined in their favour after that date, is treated no less 
favourably than if the application had been determined on 31 March 2022. Do 
you have any views on the proposals regarding ill-health retirement? In 
particular, do you think that any amendment to the 2015 Scheme is required 
to achieve this intent?</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b>: The regulations will need to ensure that provisions which allow 
arrangements for purchasing service in the legacy schemes by periodical 
contributions, entered into before 1 April 2022, can continue on and after that 
date and that additional benefit purchasing in the legacy schemes ceases on 
31 March 2022. In your view, would existing provisions in the relevant 
reformed scheme regulations achieve these aims? Alternatively, would 
additional provisions be needed to achieve this outcome?</p>

<p><b>Question 4</b>: We are interested in understanding whether the scheme 
regulation amendments will have an impact on people with protected 
characteristics, beyond those equality considerations undertaken and set out 
in the EQIA undertaken alongside the consultation and PSPJO<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. Protected 
characteristics are: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil 
partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex, and 
sexual orientation. Do you think that the draft regulations and policy intent as 
set out above will have any positive or negative impacts on people with 
protected characteristics, beyond those already considered? If so, which and 
why/why not?</p>

<p><b>Question 5</b>: Are there any other areas which you think should be addressed in 
these regulations to ensure all members are moved to the relevant reformed scheme from 1 April 2022, and that the differential treatment, as identified by 
the Court of Appeal, is ended?</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in this consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Conclusion and next steps</h2>

<p>6.1. Implementation is subject to the passage of the PSPJO. We would 
expect to lay regulations, subject to this consultation, in early March, to 
come into force on 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>6.2. All scheme members still accruing benefits in a legacy pension scheme 
will be automatically moved across to the reformed scheme on 1 April 
2022.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Draft Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) for Police Pension Scheme Regulations Prospective Amendments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Name and outline of policy proposal, guidance or operational activity</h3>

<p>The police pensions (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2022.</p>

<p>Consultation on police pension scheme regulation changes to enact the first 
phase (âprospectiveâ) of the remedy to the McCloud / Sargeant cases.</p>

<p>The first phase of the remedy is to make changes to the scheme regulations, 
in line with the Public Service Pensions &amp; Judicial Offices Bill, which will close 
the legacy pension schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022 and ensure 
all members who remain in service from 1 April 2022 do so as members of the 
reformed scheme (âthe 2015 Schemeâ). This will ensure future equal 
treatment going forwards.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>This EIA is a live document, published in draft. It reflects our careful 
considering of a range of data and evidence and provides a proportionate 
response on some of the key considerations made at this stage. This EIA will 
be kept under review and updated in future to reflect further considerations, 
including in relation to indirect discrimination.</p>

<p>We welcome feedback on this EIA, to support its development, as we move to 
amend the pension scheme regulations to enact the first phase of the remedy 
to make prospective changes to the scheme regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Summary of the evidence considered in demonstrating due regard to the Public-Sector Equality Duty</h3>

<p>We have used statistical data on the police workforce collected by the Home 
Office and pension scheme valuation data from the Government Actuary Department, published here:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Purpose</h3>

<p>The Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) is set out in section 149 of the 
Equality Act 2010 and requires public authorities, in the exercise of their 
functions, to have due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the 2010 Act,</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not, and</li>
  <li>foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.</li>
</ul>

<p>This involves having due regard to the need to:</p>

<p>(a) remove or minimise disadvantages suffered by people due to their 
protected characteristics, and</p>

<p>(b) take steps to meet the needs of people from protected groups where 
these are different from the needs of other people.</p>

<p>The equality duty covers the nine protected characteristics: age, disability, 
gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and 
maternity, race, religion or belief, sex (gender) and sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/42336/documents/588" rel="external">HM Treasury has conducted an equality impact assessment</a>, which considers 
the impact of the overarching policy and the proposed Bill powers and 
requirements. As set out in that assessment, in particular paragraph 1.8, that assessment âdoes not cover 
secondary legislation made using powers in this Bill. Separate analysis to 
consider the impact of changes to scheme regulations (beyond those covered 
and/or directed by the measures in the Bill) will be produced when the powers 
to do so are exercisedâ.</p>

<p>This assessment therefore focusses on the impact of the proposed changes 
to scheme rules necessary to deliver the Bill requirements, specifically in 
relation to the first phase of remedy (âprospectiveâ). This closes the 1987 and 
2006 police pension schemes to future accrual on 31 March 2022 and moves 
all members who continue in service to the 2015 police pension scheme on 1 
April 2022.</p>

<p>The equality duty is an ongoing duty and we will continue to consider and 
amend this assessment until the final regulations enacting the prospective 
remedy are made.</p>

<p>A separate assessment will be carried out in due course that focusses on the 
second phase of remedy (âretrospectiveâ) i.e. ensuring that eligible members 
have a choice of the benefits they wish to take for the âremedy periodâ of April 
2015 to 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>To note, data used in this assessment is predominantly from the actuarial 
valuation as at 31 March 2016. More recent data is not currently available, but 
we will update the data if and where available in formulating the final 
assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Consideration of the duty</h3>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<h5>Members in Scope</h5>

<p>Police Pension Scheme members in scope are those members who started 
pensionable public service on or before 31 March 2012, had legacy scheme 
membership during the remedy period and remain an active member of the 
legacy Police Pension Scheme on 31 March 2022. The unlawful age 
discrimination was between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those members who received full protection because they were ten years or less from ordinary pension age<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> of the 1987 scheme or Normal Pension Age of the 2006 scheme at 1 April 2012, and</li>
  <li>those members who received taper protection because they were between ten to fourteen years from ordinary pension age of the 1987 scheme or Normal Pension Age of the 2006 scheme at 1 April 2012, and</li>
  <li>those members who did not receive transitional protections because they were more than fourteen years from that age at 1 April 2021.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 1 of the remedy covers Police Pension Scheme members who 
received full transitional protection and applies equally to all these members.</p>

<h5>Members out of Scope</h5>

<p>Police Pension Scheme members out of scope are those members who first 
joined any public service pension scheme after 31 March 2012. These 
members were ineligible for transitional protection regardless of their age, and 
therefore were not subject to the age discrimination identified by the Court of 
Appeal.</p>

<h4>Age</h4>

<p>The transitional protection implemented as part of the reforms to public 
service pension schemes - the reforms based on the recommendations of 
Lord Hutton - was found by the Court of Appeal to be directly age 
discriminatory as eligibility for such protection was based on age criteria.</p>

<p>The table below shows the number of protected members in the 1987 
Scheme and the 2006 Scheme, as at 31 March 2016.</p>

<p>Table 1: Number of protected members in the 1987 and 2006 Schemes

at 31 March 2016 Report on membership data).</p>

</table>

<p>The proposed changes to Police Pension Scheme Regulations will be applied 
to all members regardless of age. The exceptions that allowed certain members 
who were closer to retirement age to remain in the legacy scheme after 31 
March 2015 under the transitional protection arrangement will apply only in 
respect of service up to 31 March 2022. From 1 April 2022, all active members 
will be moved to the 2015 Police Pension Scheme and from that point will build 
future pension rights on the same basis irrespective of age.</p>

<p>The effects of such transitional protection will be addressed by the second 
phase of the remedy. All eligible members will be offered a choice over the set 
of benefits (legacy scheme or new scheme) they wish to receive for any 
pensionable service during the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022. This is 
the remedy period in respect of which similar provisions in other public service 
pension schemes was found to be discriminatory by the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>As above in section 3.6. interaction of retirement ages between schemes, we 
are aware of concerns in relation to the difference in retirement ages between 
schemes. This issue is explored in sections 3.39-3.42 of the EIA undertaken 
for the PSPJO and, as signposted there, we are undertaking further analysis 
as to the potential impact of this in such cases, but at present remain of the 
view that the limited impacts on these protected groups are justified in the 
context of the aim of removing earlier discrimination in a manner that respects 
the rationale for maintaining any transitional protection up to 31 March 2022 
and moving all members to a reformed scheme from 1 April 2022.</p>

<h4>Sex</h4>

<p>The Equality Act 2010 lists âsexâ as a protected characteristic. Data for the 
Police Pension Scheme is also divided by sex. That said, it the case that sex 
and gender are two different concepts. A personâs gender identity is not 
always the same as the sex assigned to them at birth, and some people may 
not identify as having a gender or as non-binary. Gender reassignment is also 
a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>Closing the legacy scheme to future pension accrual applies to all legacy 
scheme members regardless of sex. From 1 April 2022 all Police Pension 
Scheme members, who remain in pensionable service, will only be eligible to 
do so as a member of the new scheme. Moving from a final salary legacy 
scheme to a career average reformed scheme for future accrual flattens out 
the added benefit of late career pay progression for higher earners who are 
more likely to be male. However, in doing so the aim is to ensure equal 
treatment of all active members for future service.</p>

<p>Police Pension Scheme actuarial valuation data at 31 March 2016 shows that 
70.2% of the active membership are male and 29.8% of the membership are 
female. This is broadly similar to data in the Home Office Police Workforce, 
England and Wales statistical release, which shows that 29.5% of police 
officers at 31 March 2016 (including those who are not members of the Police 
Pension Scheme) were female. This was 32.4% at 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>Moving from a final salary legacy scheme to a career average reformed 
scheme for future accrual from 1 April 2022 may also impact members that 
take career breaks or work part-time and data tells us that a higher proportion 
of women do so than men. A change to the overall picture of benefits may 
impact a memberâs previous assumptions about when and how they would 
take their pension. However, changes to pension arrangements by their 
nature impact differently on those who join or leave police service at different 
times and the proposed changes will apply to all members regardless of sex. 
We therefore remain of the view that the limited impacts on women are 
justified and in the context that, from 1 April 2022, all active members will be 
in the career average reformed scheme and from that point will accrue future 
pension benefits on the same basis irrespective of sex.</p>

<p>The table below shows the number of active protected members in the 1987 
Scheme and the 2006 Scheme, who are female and male, as at 31 March 
2016.</p>

2006 Schemes and the number of tapered female and male members in the

<h4>Ethnicity (Race)</h4>

<p>Available data on the Police Pension Scheme membership only covers 
membersâ age and sex. However, police workforce data is available on the 
protected characteristics of Ethnicity. This is regarded as a reasonable proxy 
given the high percentage of police officers who are pension scheme 
members. However, the workforce data on Ethnicity of police officers does 
include those who are not members of the Police Pension Scheme.</p>

<p>The table below shows the Ethnicity of police officers who declared their 
ethnicity, using data as at 31 March 2021, from the Police Workforce, England 
and Wales statistical release.</p>

<p>We have considered the potential impact on members from different ethnic 
backgrounds and the proposed phase one amendments will apply to all 
members equally, regardless of their ethnicity.</p>

<h4>Marriage and Civil Partnership</h4>

<p>There is no available data on this group in relation to the police workforce or 
Police Pension Scheme membership. However, the Department has 
considered the potential impact of the proposals on members who have this 
protected characteristic as part of our analysis on sex.</p>

<h4>Disability, Religion and Belief, Gender Reassignment, Sexual Orientation, Pregnancy and Maternity</h4>

<p>Available data on people with these protected characteristics, both in the 
Police Pension Scheme and the police workforce, is limited. However, we 
have considered the potential equality impacts of the proposed changes for 
members who share these protected characteristics and those who do not.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the limited evidence available, the Department does 
not envisage any unjustified differential impacts that the consequential 
amendments will cause for members by reference to these protected 
characteristics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Department has not identified additional benefits, costs or wider impacts 
flowing from the consequential Police Pension Scheme Regulations 
amendments enacting phase one of the remedy, as these are consequential in nature and designed to deliver the Bill requirements, which have been assessed by HM Treasury.</p>

<p>The Department has considered the impact of the proposals in context of this 
duty. To reiterate, the equality duty is an ongoing duty and we will continue to 
consider and amend this assessment until the final regulation amendments for 
prospective remedy are laid. We invite respondents to help refine this analysis 
by contributing further perspectives or identifying where there might be 
equality impacts to consider. Please see question four of the consultation.</p>

<h3>Active member</h3>

<p>A member of a police pension scheme who is actively employed as a 
police officer (i.e. they have not retired, resigned or otherwise ended 
the employment).</p>

<h3>Affected member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who has suffered age discrimination, i.e. anyone 
who was employed as a police officer on both 1 April 2012 and 1 April 
2015, but did not qualify for full transitional protection, on the former 
date. It includes taper protected members.</p>

<h3>Age discrimination</h3>

<p>Treating employees or any other group of people less favourably 
because of their age. Age discrimination is unlawful unless it can be 
shown to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>

<h3>Career average revalued earnings (CARE)</h3>

<h3>Deferred choice underpin (DCU)</h3>

<p>The mechanism by which affected and fully protected members will 
decide whether their service during the remedy period should be 
treated as service in their legacy scheme or the 2015 Scheme. Such 
a choice will be made when the member retires or when their pension

<p>A scheme member who was granted full transitional protection in 2015.</p>

<h3>Legacy scheme</h3>

<p>The scheme of which an affected or fully protected member was a 
member immediately before 1 April 2015 â i.e. the 1987 Scheme or 
the 2006 Scheme.</p>

<h3>McCloud, Sargeant, or McCloud / Sargeant</h3>

<p>The court cases of McCloud (in relation to judges) and Sargeant (in 
relation to firefighters) which established that age-based transitional 
protection amounted to unlawful age discrimination.</p>

<h3>Normal pension age (NPA)</h3>

<p>The age at which an active member normally becomes entitled to 
receive their pension. It is typically stipulated in scheme rules and can 
vary from one scheme to another. For instance, the 1987 Scheme 
has no NPA, the 2006 Scheme has an NPA of 55 and the 2015 
Scheme has an NPA of 60.</p>

<h3>Prospective remedy</h3>

<p>From 1 April 2022, all those who continue in service will do so as 
members of the reformed scheme, regardless of age, meaning all 
members will be treated equally in terms of which pension scheme 
they are a member.</p>

<h3>Remedy period</h3>

<p>The period to which the remedy for age discrimination will apply: 1 
April 2015 to 31 March 2022, inclusive.</p>

<h3>Retired member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who has retired and is receiving pension benefits.</p>

<h3>Retrospective remedy</h3>

<p>Affected members and fully protected members will receive at the 
point they retire a choice of which pension benefits that they would 
prefer to receive in respect of any remediable service rendered 
between 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2022. This choice is whether the 
benefits should be modelled on the relevant legacy scheme or 
reformed scheme. This is known as the Deferred Choice Underpin 
(DCU). Where members are already receiving pensions, they will be 
given a choice as soon as practicable</p>

<h3>Transitional protection</h3>

<p>The right to remain as a member of a legacy scheme in 2015, the 
criteria for which are as set out in the Reform Design Framework<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. The courts have held that granting this right on the basis of age was unlawful.</p>

<h3>Taper protected member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who was offered tapered transitional protection in 
2015, i.e. the right to join the 2015 Scheme on a phased basis. Taper 
protected members are also affected members.</p>
