<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government’s ambition is to deliver nationwide gigabit-capable broadband as soon as possible. We recognise that there is a need for government intervention in the parts of the country that are not commercially viable, this is why the government has committed £5 billion for the hardest to reach parts of the country, ensuring that all areas of the UK can benefit. This will be spent through a package of coordinated and mutually supportive interventions, collectively known as Project Gigabit.</p>

<p>BDUK conducted an Open Market Review (OMR) on 20 October 2021 to 22 November 2021 to understand from suppliers if there were any current or planned investment over the next three years (and beyond, if available) in broadband infrastructure (Next Generation Access broadband, ultrafast and gigabit-capable) within the Surrey lot.</p>

<p>The Public Review process aims to validate the outcome of the OMR and BDUK’s mapping to ensure that it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers in the course of the OMR and to ensure that the right areas are targeted for government investment.</p>

<p>We invite stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible area for government investment set out in this document.</p>

<p>Suppliers who missed contributing to the preceding OMR, had no definitive plans and / or evidence base on which to substantiate claims at that earlier stage, or have subsequently updated their plans now have a final opportunity to notify BDUK before the procurement stage. The premises identified by BDUK as eligible may be grouped into one or more appropriately sized Intervention Areas (IAs). The IAs will be issued to the market so that suppliers can bid for funding to support delivery to those areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-gigabit-uk-subsidy-advice">Key Eligibility Requirements for Subsidy</a>
</h2>

<p>The outcome of this PR and the preceding OMR is shown in terms of White, Grey, Black and Under Review premises. We will only subsidise build to premises which have been designated as White.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>White</strong> - indicates premises with no gigabit network infrastructure and none is likely to be developed within 3 years. <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexc">Annex C</a> provides information on the technology ‘qualifying’ as gigabit-capable</li>
  <li>
<strong>Black</strong> - premises with two or more qualifying gigabit infrastructures from different suppliers being available, or will be deployed in the coming 3 years</li>
  <li>
<strong>Grey</strong> premises - a single qualifying gigabit infrastructure from a single supplier is available, or is to be deployed within the coming 3 years</li>
  <li>
<strong>Under Review</strong> - premises where suppliers have reported planned commercial broadband coverage, but where those plans have been judged through the OMR as potentially being at risk of not being completed</li>
</ul>

<p>Premises categorised as Under Review will be subject to continued monitoring and verification of supplier plans within the three-year period by BDUK. BDUK may request commitment from the supplier that significant progress is made within three years. In the event that these commercial plans fall away, these premises will be mapped as eligible and form part of the proposed intervention area and so eligible for intervention via this aid measure. We request that suppliers inform us regarding all plans, including plans beyond the initial three-year period.</p>

<p>BDUK classifies premises on the basis of their existing or planned broadband infrastructure, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexb">Annex B</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexc">Annex C</a>. The OMR and PR data analysis of supplier’s broadband coverage claims is undertaken at UPRN (premises) level.</p>

<p>Once the PR has closed, if additional information or clarifications are required, BDUK will raise Clarification Questions with suppliers before deciding on a classification.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>What are the step change requirements?</h3>

<p>BDUK also requires that public intervention should be able to ensure a step change in broadband availability from that currently available as well as credible planned networks. This is demonstrated by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>generally, download speeds must be at least doubled and upload speeds substantially higher as a result of the intervention when compared with existing download and upload speeds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>significant new investments in the broadband network are undertaken (ie investments that must include civil works and installation of new passive elements)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the new infrastructure brings significant new capabilities to the market in terms of broadband service availability, capacity, speeds and / or competition</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The step change in broadband availability shall be compared to that of existing as well as credible planned networks.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Outcome of the Open Market Review (OMR) - Surrey - Lot 22</h2>

<p>BDUK initiated an OMR for Surrey (Lot 22) from 20 October 2021 to 22 November 2021. You can view the OMR publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/project-gigabit-programme-open-market-review-request-for-information-second-release-of-phase-2">here</a>.</p>

<p>The OMR indicated that planned commercial coverage for gigabit-capable broadband would reach approximately 400,662 premises, and would therefore leave the remaining 211,251  premises without access to gigabit-capable broadband.</p>

<p>The outcome of the OMR is shown within the map (<a class="govuk-link" href="#annexd">Annex D</a>) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063732/Surrey_OMR_Outcome_Postcode_List.ods" rel="external">associated postcode list</a> published alongside this document and shows the subsidy classifications determined for each postcode within the Surrey lot. Supplier data submitted during the OMR has been incorporated into the OMR outputs using a methodology that protects commercially sensitive supplier data.</p>

<p>For presentational purposes only, postcodes have been used when mapping the proposed eligible areas for this Public Review. (NB we will only subsidise build to premises which have been designated as White - postcodes are not used to determine intervention areas for subsidy).</p>

<p>For the purpose of mapping only, postcodes have been classified as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>White</strong> if any ‘White’ premises are present</li>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>Under Review</strong> if any ‘Under Review’ premises are present</li>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>Black</strong> if all premises in the postcode are classified ‘Black’</li>
  <li>A postcode is <strong>Grey</strong> if all premises are ‘Grey’ or there is a mixture of ‘Grey’ and ‘Black’ premises</li>
</ol>

<p>The outcome of the OMR is summarised in terms of ‘White’, ‘Grey’, ‘Black’ and ‘Under Review’ postcodes and premises below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Purpose of this Public Review Request For Information</h2>

<p><strong>This Public Review defines the proposed eligible areas, as determined during the OMR, to enable all interested stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to comment on those proposals.</strong></p>

<p>The outcome of the OMR is shown within the map in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annexd">Annex D</a>  and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063732/Surrey_OMR_Outcome_Postcode_List.ods" rel="external">associated postcode list</a> published alongside this document.</p>

<p>As part of this Public Review, we will request and then evaluate any further responses in order to validate the eligibility of the premises for government subsidy. During the evaluation exercise, we may engage with suppliers further to discuss and confirm their coverage claims. Following this, we will be able to determine the premises to be included in procurements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>The steps below shows a summary of how the PR process works:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>BDUK issues Public Review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholders review proposed eligible areas for intervention. BDUK response to clarification questions (as required).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholders submit feedback on the Public Review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BDUK reviews and evaluates the feedback. BDUK investigates and discusses feedback with respondent (as required).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BDUK finalises premises classification and published outcome of Public Review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Review process concludes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppliers wishing to provide coverage data should contact BDUK and will follow a process similar to the one run for the Open Market Review.</p>
</div>

<p>This Public Review will take place over the period of at least one month, and once concluded will confirm the eligibility of premises for procurements. The full details of these procurements will follow the conclusion of this OMR and Public Review.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>The steps below show the order of processes, from OMR to procurement:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>OMR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine intervention areas for procurement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procurement</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>All meaningful responses to the Public Review will be carefully considered and where necessary, used to determine eligible premises. The final eligible area maps and a summary report confirming details of the changes will be published on the gov.uk website after the close of the review period. The finalised eligible premises and proposed Intervention Areas will then be submitted to BDUK’s National Competence Centre (NCC) for approval against the UK Subsidy Control Regime. The responses and output from the Public Review will therefore help us gain further confidence that the proposed interventions are in areas that are eligible for subsidy, ie, areas which are not commercially viable and require government intervention to address market failure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Changes to Lot Area</h2>

<p>Please note, Lot areas are not fully aligned to local authority (LA) boundaries, and in some cases a small number of premises from neighbouring local authorities may be included in the scope of a specific Lot. Suppliers should also note that the specific Lot boundaries (and intervention areas) may flex during the OMR, Public Review and Pre-Procurement Market Engagement processes to enable an optimum procurement to be put to the market. Where this occurs then BDUK will ensure that it is communicated in a transparent manner in order to remain consistent with the principles of the Gigabit Infrastructure Scheme. Therefore if you have existing network coverage, or plan to build infrastructure in neighbouring LA areas, then please provide details in your response to this Public Review.</p>

<p>Since the OMR closed on 22nd November 2021, there have been no amendments to the proposed Lot Boundary Area. The OMR outcomes provided above, and shown in Annex D, are consistent with the proposed Lot Boundary Area that is now going to Public Review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>The role of local bodies</h2>

<p>BDUK will work with the relevant local bodies to answer questions, evaluate supplier responses, assess data accuracy, manage the build phase and engage with the local community. Sharing the premises data set out within each location and intervention areas, during the OMR and Public Review stages, will help us gain further confidence that the proposed interventions are eligible for subsidy.</p>

<p>BDUK will maintain a central dataset and will work with authorities to assess and review the data in the areas relevant to the respective local body and intervention areas. BDUK will be responsible for the data and local bodies are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to gaining access to the data.</p>

<p>This Request for Information is being carried out independently of any activities that local bodies may be undertaking, for example, under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2016-nbs-overview">National Broadband Scheme 2016</a> known as the Superfast Programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Procurement and commercial approach</h2>

<p>BDUK has undertaken extensive early market engagement in relation to procurement for interventions. This engagement has included consultation on the programme design, different potential target areas, technical specification (including wholesale access), procurement types and contractual terms. Feedback from broadband suppliers and other stakeholders has been taken into account in all of these areas.</p>

<p>Procurements will be carried out in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/contents/made" rel="external">Public Contracts Regulations 2015</a> (PCR 2015). BDUK procurement approaches are designed to address the scale of the individual procurements. The procurements will be conducted in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Forthcoming procurement - Surrey (Lot 22)</h3>

<p>BDUK will budget an appropriate amount of public funding from the Project Gigabit Programme, based on the final number of premises requiring subsidy for this area, at the procurement stage.</p>

<p>The budget will be specified within the Invitation To Tender (ITT) documentation, following the Public Review. Details of any restrictions on the use of public subsidy will be explained in the tender documentation. It is BDUK’s intention to procure gigabit-capable solutions – capable of achieving a minimum of 1Gbps download speed - to the premises identified as in scope for subsidy.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, the final list of premises in scope for subsidy will be issued with the ITT and is not finalised at this stage.</p>
</div>

<p>Final Project Gigabit Intervention Areas may be a subset of the premises classified as White in the subsidy assessment and will be subject to BDUK overlays, including other active / planned BDUK interventions (eg Superfast).</p>

<p>Once the review is closed and BDUK has finalised the Intervention Area, an ITT will be issued within approximately 6 months via a procurement portal, for suppliers to bid for the opportunity to deliver extended gigabit-capable broadband coverage.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Participating / Responding to this Public Review</h2>

<p>BDUK’s goal is to ensure the parts of the country that need government investment are accurately targeted. Each contributor to this Public Review will help to optimise the use of public subsidy in helping to provide faster and better connectivity across all parts of the UK.</p>

<p>Please respond if you have information to contribute to this data validation process or can provide your views about the accuracy of data and mapped areas by reporting where premises have existing or planned gigabit-capable broadband coverage. If you are a supplier and did not respond to the recent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/project-gigabit-programme-open-market-review-request-for-information-second-release-of-phase-2">OMR Request For Information - Second Release of Phase 2</a> and have existing or planned network coverage, please submit your plans so that public subsidy can be targeted more accurately and over-building commercial infrastructure can be avoided. Where suppliers have credible plans that extend beyond the three year horizon then these should be included in your submission to BDUK. All planned builds should be supported with detailed evidence as set out in the submission requirements of this RFI.</p>

<p>Please note that the information you provide in your response will be treated as confidential, albeit that it may be necessary to share some  / all of your response with our professional advisors and/or local bodies, Ofcom and BEIS Subsidy Control Branch.

<span class="number">12. </span>Annex A: Data submission format</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>BDUK requires certain fields of data for each pertinent UK address as identified by the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) in order to monitor the current and future delivery of Gigabit broadband capable services. This is done by requesting data on current and future connections from relevant suppliers. The below describes the format of the BDUK request file and how to format the data to return to us. If you require any additional support, guidance or clarification with this, please get in touch with us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ukgigabit@bduk.zendesk.com">ukgigabit@bduk.zendesk.com</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>File formats</h3>

<p>BDUK will supply blank templates for the PR (as outlined in Annex A), showing the UPRNs across the nation that we consider relevant to the PR process. For easier working, these have been divided into ten separate templates, covering: Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, North West, North East, Central East, Central West, South West, South East and finally a No Region file.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>These UPRNs have been sourced from Address Base Premium Epoch 91, from Ordnance Survey published March 2022. Even though we are, at this stage, specifically focussing on data for Surrey, for the purposes of our broadband planning we would be grateful for your full broadband plans, including premises that are outside of these geographic areas, and/or outside of the premises base provided in the template files.</p>

<p>Please do not pre-filter your data based on the template files, instead please provide us with your entire UPRN dataset.</p>

<p>If you are using the template files as the starting point for your return, please remove any UPRN rows which are not part of your current or planned network.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>’Normally available’</strong> speed is defined as the speed a customer could expect to receive during peak times - measured as 8pm to 10pm for residential services and 12pm to 2pm for business services and reflecting when customers are most likely to use the service.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>’Minimum speed’</strong> is defined as the minimum guaranteed speed a customer should expect from the service, which would trigger the customers right to exit the contract if speeds fall below this minimum level and are unable to be resolved within a 30-day period.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriate indicators of quality of the service eg contention ratio and/or bandwidth allocation per end user, together with a technical explanation of how these will support the achievement of the normally available and minimum speeds for all users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A description of the technical architectures that demonstrate how the claimed data speeds and performance will be maintained end-to-end across the deployed infrastructure.  This could include, for example, network connectivity diagrams, deployment / coverage maps, design / dimensioning rules for network elements, backhaul capacity information, types and quantities of equipment, technical specifications, network performance measurements etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Description of all services / products offered over the infrastructure including any wholesale provision to any retail service providers currently offered and any planned extension to these services within the next 3 years.

<p><strong>In order for BDUK to evaluate any planned investment and coverage claims provided as part of the PR process, please provide evidence within ‘Part D: Planned Investments’ of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/project-gigabit-supporting-document-templates">Supporting evidence template</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You should as a minimum include an outline Business Plan, a detailed calendar deployment plan and evidence of adequate financing for each stage of the proposed build.</strong></p>

<p>We would also like information about company structure (for example parent company), evidence of adequate capital (or your plans to raise capital), dependencies and assumptions associated with financing (for example revenue from an existing network or assumptions on GBVS voucher revenue) and other financial and commercial information to enable BDUK to understand the viability of your planned investment.</p>

<p>In assessing whether planned investments are viable, BDUK may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>review the business plans and calendar deployment plans to ensure these are consistent and in sufficient detail for each phase of the planned build</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require evidence to demonstrate credible and plausible character of the planned investment which as a minimum should include a business plan, a detailed calendar deployment plan, proof of adequate financing and proposed technical architecture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure calendar deployment plans include the key build stages and when suppliers expect to undertake significant activities within their build programme such as design, surveying, acquisition, network build, network installation etc or the key processes involved in your build plan approach for design phase, survey phase, road notices/ wayleaves etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test that funding availability is sufficient for each phase of the planned build and that the capital allocated for the specific OMR area is sufficient and is consistent with the deployment plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review the terms of any financing arrangements and any dependencies and assumptions associated with the financing including assumptions and dependencies around public subsidy such as GBVS vouchers or regional subsidy schemes</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Annex C: Technology definition</h2>

<p>The UK will review the criteria for gigabit-capable networks within three months of the launch of infrastructure procurement, based upon the consultation with industry, and the UK regulator, around the criteria below. In the meantime BDUK will work with the following technical definition:</p>

<p>Infrastructure that can support gigabit-capable services directly or via third-party providers without restriction, as set out below:</p>

<p>(a) Connections that are gigabit-capable (capable of delivering 1000Mbps or more download speeds) at the time of delivery of the connection without the need for future hardware upgrades or modification<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> ie gigabit capability to be available from day one and if the consumer takes a slower speed it must be soft upgradeable without undue delay.</p>

<p>(b) At least one product with a download speed capability of at least 1Gbps and an upload speed of at least 200Mbps with busy hour performance as laid out below.</p>

<p>(c) Products with a clear and comprehensible explanation of the minimum, normally available<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and maximum advertised download and upload speeds.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>(d) Low data latency in accordance with Ofcom regime or codes of practice, recent industry norms and Industry Standards for the requirements of real-time services (or otherwise, in the absence of prevailing standards 10 ms and below for 95% of the time).</p>

<p>(e) Support for real-time services (eg voice/video calling, telematics, telemedicine etc) with performance indicators (eg jitter, packet loss etc) in line with recent industry standards, or in the absence of industry standards: 2ms for jitter, and 0.1% for packet loss, 95% of the time.</p>

<p>(f) Actual data speeds and performance during the busiest hours of the day (not more than 4 out of every 24), that do not degrade below 33% of the headline download speed, and an upload speed equivalent to 20% of the minimum download speed (note: for performance where lower values are better, such as latency, jitter and packet loss, then a factor of 100% above would apply instead).</p>

<p>(g) Actual data speeds and performance that do not degrade outside of the busiest hours below 95% of the higher of the download and upload speeds set out above.</p>

<p>(h) Actual data speeds and performance that do not degrade as take-up of services approaches 100% of the addressable market (including any part arising from switch-off of legacy networks), to be demonstrated by firm commercial and technical (including capacity upgrade) plans based upon forecasts of up to 7 years.</p>

<p>(i) Where service offerings and performance vary by locality eg as a result of subscribers’ distances from infrastructure, gigabit capability to be maintained for all potential customers.</p>

<p>(j) Order fulfilment and rectification within typical industry timescales, supported by demonstrably efficient service management processes.</p>

<p>(k) Maintenance of customer service levels and network availability in line with industry norms, ideally supported by Service Level Agreements.</p>

<p>(l) Service provision that does not unfairly discriminate against particular types of services, providers, subscribers or third parties (eg via traffic shaping or Quality of Service measures).</p>

<p>(m) For subsidised networks only; offering of wholesale access products on open and non-discriminatory terms in line with the principle of technological neutrality, to enable the interconnection to the subsidised network of any technology which other communications providers and/or retail providers may reasonably consider appropriate in accordance with the wholesale access requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Annex E: Subsidy control</h2>

<p>Following the UK’s departure from the European Union on 31 January 2020, the award of public subsidy needs to take account of World Trade Organisation rules and any international commitments made in free trade agreements. BDUK considers that this proposed subsidy falls under the subsidy control principles in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948119/EU-UK_Trade_and_Cooperation_Agreement_24.12.2020.pdf" rel="external">Section 3 of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement</a> (TCA) agreed between the European Union and UK Government on the 24th December 2020. The TCA places an obligation on both the UK and EU to have an effective system of subsidy control with independent oversight.</p>

<p>BDUK will ensure that it meets these subsidy principles in awarding public subsidy for gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure (for example, by ensuring subsidy is designed to target failure in the market to achieve full UK coverage while minimising negative effects on competition). Public subsidy will be targeted to limit the risks of crowding out private investment, altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately distorting competition. Projects will continue to be procured under the Public Contracts Regulations (2020), to help meet our subsidy control requirements.</p>

<p>Suppliers have the opportunity during the OMR and Public Review stages, to share with BDUK any firm and credible investment plans that may mean that public subsidy will not be warranted.</p>

<p><strong>Requesting a review of a subsidy award</strong></p>

<p>Under UK subsidy control requirements, anyone can request for a review about the award of subsidy. Requests must be submitted no later than one month from the date of the award of the subsidy for Surrey (Lot 22). The award of subsidy will follow the procurement and contract award and BDUK’s National Competency Centre will consider requests submitted within the one month timescale, under the terms of the TCA.</p>

<p>This proposed award will be published by the Department of Business Energy Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The process for making such a request will be published here too.</p>
