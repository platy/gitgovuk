<p>The UK has one of the most ambitious approaches in the world to achieving net zero by 2050. We are committed to going further and faster to tackle climate change. We need to limit global warming to well below 2°C and have legislated to end the UK’s contribution to climate change by 2050. Transport is currently the largest contributor to UK domestic greenhouse gas emissions, 27% in 2019.</p>

<p>UK bus operators have invested over £1.3 billion in cleaner and greener buses over the last 5 years, supported by £89 million funding through our previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/low-emission-bus-scheme-2016-to-2017-successful-bidders">low</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ultra-low-emission-bus-scheme-successful-bidders">ultra-low emission bus schemes</a>. However, there is much more to do. Most of these vehicles are hybrid or gas-powered and only around 2% of England’s bus fleet is fully zero-emission as of 2021.</p>

<p>New vehicles offer more than environmental benefits – with more comfortable journeys and a reduction in vehicle noise and vibration they provide an opportunity to attract new users. The added incentive is that we expect that zero-emission buses will achieve operating cost savings in the longer term, which can be reinvested in more frequent services, lower fares and other improvements for passengers.</p>

<p>The challenge of decarbonising transport demands a step change in both the breadth and scale of the ambition domestically. In November 2021, the UK will host the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>’s annual climate change conference, <abbr title="Conference of the Parties 26">COP26</abbr>, where the UK’s leadership in tackling climate change, including in transport, will be showcased on a global stage.</p>

<p>To meet these zero emission ambitions and incorporate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/" rel="external">Independent Committee on Climate Change’s advice</a> on what is needed so the UK ends its contribution to climate change by 2050, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bus-back-better">national bus strategy for England</a> states we have this initial consultation on ending the sale of new diesel buses in England.</p>

<p>We are interested in views on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the definition of what should be phased out?</li>
  <li>when you think the sale of diesel buses should end (the phase-out date for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consulting-on-ending-the-sale-of-new-petrol-diesel-and-hybrid-cars-and-vans">ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars and vans is 2030)</a>?</li>
  <li>what you believe will be the impact on ending the sale of new diesel buses?</li>
  <li>what you believe are the necessary conditions for a successful transition to a full green bus fleet?</li>
  <li>what barriers, in your view, to achieving the proposals?</li>
  <li>the impact, you believe, these ambitions will have on different sectors of industry and society?</li>
  <li>what measures are required by government and others to support this phase-out?</li>
</ul>
