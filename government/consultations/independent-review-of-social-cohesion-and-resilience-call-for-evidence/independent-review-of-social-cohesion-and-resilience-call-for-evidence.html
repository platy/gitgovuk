<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Topic of call for evidence</h2>

<p>This call for evidence  seeks views on: the experience of victims of extremism, protecting social cohesion and strengthening resilience against extremist and other harmful divisive activity. These views will help underpin the findings and recommendations of Sara Khan Independent Review of Social Cohesion and Resilience.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Scope of call for evidence</h2>

<p>Dame Sara Khan has been appointed by the Prime Minister as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sara-khan-appointed-as-independent-advisor-for-social-cohesion-and-resilience">Independent Adviser for Social Cohesion and Resilience</a> at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). Sara will work to understand the harm extremism is causing local communities, build resilience against it and better support victims, local authorities and civil society who are working to counter harmful extremist activity which is undermining social cohesion and our democratic freedoms.</p>

<p>This call for evidence  is focussed around three main themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experiences of those targeted by extremists and other divisive actors</li>
  <li>Understanding the role of local authorities and public bodies in promoting cohesion and countering extremism</li>
  <li>Supporting local communities and civil society to challenge extremism, develop community resilience and promote cohesion</li>
</ul>

<p>Sara will make a series of recommendations on how to build resilience against extremism, understand its impact, and better support its victims and those working to counter it to the Levelling Up Secretary and Prime Minister as part of her review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Introduction and background</h2>

<p>As the government’s Independent Adviser for Social Cohesion and Resilience, Sara Khan is gathering evidence on the harm extremism is causing at a local level, with a focus on its impact on individuals, local communities and social cohesion. She will hear from victims of extremism, local authorities and those on the frontline working to combat it – from teachers, faith leaders to local councillors, and from those in more specialist counter extremism roles. The review will seek to understand the breadth of challenges, risks and support required when faced with extremism at a local level, and how to protect social cohesion and strengthen community resilience.</p>

<p>The review will identify gaps in existing approaches and put forward recommendations to the government on what more is needed to better support and protect those who challenge and/or fall victim to extremist activity, and what more is required in partnership with others to prevent and resolve extremism and other divisive activity in local communities.</p>

<p>This call for evidence is divided into three main sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experiences of those targeted by extremists e.g. Far Right, Far Left, Islamist and other religious fundamentalists</li>
  <li>Understanding the role of local authorities and public bodies in promoting cohesion and countering extremism</li>
  <li>Supporting local communities and civil society to challenge extremism, develop community resilience and promote cohesion</li>
</ul>

<p>This call for evidence is inviting responses from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Individual members of the public</li>
  <li>Those who have been targeted by extremists, those who have witnessed the impact and provided support to those targeted by extremists</li>
  <li>Frontline practitioners in social cohesion and counter-extremism roles</li>
  <li>Representatives from local authorities, including elected Councillors, Chief Executives, Directors, officers and frontline employees</li>
  <li>Representatives from public bodies, including the police, schools and colleges, and other service providers</li>
  <li>Representatives from local partnerships and bodies, such as Community Safety Partnerships and Local Resilience Forums</li>
  <li>Journalists</li>
  <li>Politicians</li>
  <li>Academics engaged in empirical research on social cohesion, community resilience and extremism issues</li>
  <li>Those who work in think-tanks, charities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations (CSOs) in roles that are related to social cohesion, community resilience and extremism</li>
  <li>Private sector, including local businesses</li>
</ul>

<p>Those providing evidence are not required or expected to complete every section, only those which are most relevant to their experience.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this call for evidence, please refer to the following definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Government 2015 definition of extremism: Extremism is the vocal or active opposition to our fundamental values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs. We also regard calls for the death of members of our armed forces as extremist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commission for Countering Extremism 2021 definition of hateful extremism: Activity or materials directed at an out-group who are perceived as a threat to an in-group motivated by or intending to advance a political, religious or racial supremacist ideology to a) create a climate conducive to hate crime, terrorism or other violence; or b) attempt to erode or destroy the fundamental rights and freedoms of our democratic society&nbsp;as protected under Article 17 of Schedule 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998 (‘HRA’).</p>

</ul>

We appreciate some people may feel reticent in responding. However, it is essential these voices are heard and experiences understood. We are grateful for all those who choose to take part in this call for evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Why we are collecting the data</h3>

<p>Your personal data will be collected (where provided) as part of the call for evidence for the Independent Review of Social Cohesion and Resilience, which is being undertaken by Dame Sara Khan to understand and build resilience against the negative impact of extremism and better support its victims and those working to counter it.</p>

<p>Specifically, we may process personal data to build recommendations regarding matters covered in your responses.</p>

<p>The review will assess what more can be done to bolster protection and support for counter extremists and those who fall victim to extremism in England. It will make a series of recommendations to the Levelling Up Secretary and Prime Minister on how to build resilience against extremism, understand its impact, and better support its victims and those working to counter it. Collecting views from the public, and from experts in the subject, will help to achieve the review to meet these aims.</p>

<p>Subject to permission from DLUHC, a data processor may be appointed to analyse responses (please see section 6.4 below).</p>

<p>The data processor will use standard quantitative and qualitative data analysis techniques to classify and group the data according to themes. These will be at an anonymous and aggregate level, so that individual responses will not be identifiable. This evidence will be used to inform the Independent Reviewer’s recommendations and may be published as part of the Review.</p>

<h3>
