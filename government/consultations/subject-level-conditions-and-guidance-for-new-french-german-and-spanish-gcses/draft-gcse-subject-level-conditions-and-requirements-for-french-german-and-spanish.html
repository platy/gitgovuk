<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document is part of a suite of documents which sets out the regulatory requirements for awarding organisations offering GCSE qualifications (graded from 9 to 1).</p>

<p>We have developed these requirements with the intention that GCSE qualifications (graded from 9 to 1) should fulfil the following purposes, to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of students’ achievements against demanding and fulfilling content;</li>
  <li>a strong foundation for further academic and vocational study and for employment; and</li>
  <li>(if required) a basis for schools and colleges to be held accountable for the performance of all of their students.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements set out in this document</h3>

<p>This document sets out the GCSE Subject Level Conditions for French, German and Spanish.</p>

<p>It also sets out our requirements in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessment objectives – awarding organisations must comply with these requirements under Condition GCSE(French, German and Spanish)1.2;</li>

<h2>Tiering requirements – GCSE Qualifications in French, German and Spanish</h2>

<p>Condition GCSE(French, German and Spanish)2.1(b) allows us to specify requirements relating to assessing the full range of abilities for GCSE Qualifications (graded 9 to 1) in French, German and Spanish.</p>

<p>In accordance with Condition GCSE(French, German and Spanish)2.1(b) an awarding organisation must design, deliver and award each GCSE Qualification in French, German or Spanish that it makes available, or proposes to make available, in accordance with the requirements set out below.</p>

<h3>Use of the overlapping tiers model</h3>

<p>Each GCSE Qualification in French, German or Spanish must be tiered. An awarding organisation must design and set the assessments for each GCSE Qualification in French, German or Spanish which it makes available, or proposes to make available, using an overlapping tiers model.</p>

<p>Such a model must use two tiers – a foundation tier and a higher tier – and each assessment must be designed and set in such a way as to fall within one of those two tiers only.</p>

<h3>Preclusion of mixed tier entry</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that each Learner is permitted to take assessments in either the foundation tier or the higher tier only.</p>

<h3>Grades available at each tier</h3>

<p>The questions or tasks in foundation tier assessments must be targeted at the Level of Demand required for the award of grades 1 to 5. A Learner who takes foundation tier assessments must be awarded a grade within the range of 1 to 5, or be unclassified.</p>

<p>The questions or tasks in higher tier assessments must be targeted at the Level of Demand required for the award of grades 4 to 9. A Learner who takes higher tier assessments must be awarded a grade within the range of 4 to 9, or be unclassified. However, if the mark achieved by such a Learner is a small number of marks below the 4/3 grade boundary, that Learner may be awarded a grade 3.</p>

<h3>Assessing the full range of abilities</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the assessments within each tier allow each specified level of attainment available for that tier to be reached by a Learner who has attained the required level of knowledge, skills and understanding.</p>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the assessments both within each tier, and taken together across both tiers –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a) ensure consistent and sufficient differentiation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> between Learners; and</li>
  <li>b) ensure consistent and sufficient discrimination<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> between Learners; and</li>
  <li>c) ensure the accurate and consistent setting of grades across the full range of attainments demonstrated by Learners.</li>
</ol>

<p>In designing assessments, an awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure, at each tier, that Learners achieving the lowest targeted grade have demonstrated attainment with regard to a sufficient range of the subject requirements, in terms of the areas of content, content domains and the assessment objectives. Equally, an awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure, at each tier, that Learners achieving the higher targeted grades must have demonstrated attainment with regard to suitably stretching and challenging requirements, in terms of the areas of content, content domains and the assessment objectives.</p>

<h3>The overlap at grades 4 and 5</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must take all reasonable steps in the design and delivery of the assessments and awarding processes to secure that the level of attainment indicated by grades 4 and 5 is comparable regardless of the tier for which a Learner is entered. Each awarding organisation must demonstrate in its assessment strategy the steps it has taken to secure such comparability between tiers, including on an ongoing basis. Such steps may include, but are not restricted to, the use of common questions or tasks between tiers.</p>

<h2>Assessment Requirements – GCSE Qualifications in French, German and Spanish</h2>

<p>Condition GCSE(French, German and Spanish)3.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to assessments for GCSE Qualifications in French, German and Spanish.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition GCSE(French, German and Spanish) 3.1 below.</p>

<p>The subject content for GCSE Qualifications in French, German and Spanish is set out in the document published by the Secretary of State entitled ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-french-german-and-spanish-subject-content">GCSE French, German and Spanish subject content</a>’ (the ‘Content Document’).</p>

<h3>Grammar and sound-symbol correspondence requirements</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the specification for a GCSE Qualification in French, German or Spanish which it makes available sets out the grammar requirements that may be assessed for the qualification. Such requirements must include the sound-symbol correspondences specified in the Content Document, together with examples drawn from the vocabulary list for the qualification.</p>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must set out its approach to covering the grammar requirements in the assessments for the qualification, including the sound symbol correspondences specified in the Content Document.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary requirements</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the specification for a GCSE Qualification in French, German or Spanish which it makes available sets out the vocabulary list for the qualification.</p>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must set out its approach to compiling the vocabulary list, including an overview of the parts of speech distribution. An awarding organisation must also demonstrate its approach to covering the vocabulary requirements in the assessments.</p>

<h3>Speaking assessment</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must design and set each assessment of a Learner’s ability to speak French, German and Spanish effectively on the basis that –</p>

<ul>
  <li>each Learner shall have the same amount of formal preparation time (as defined in Condition GCSE(French, German and Spanish)5.2 in relation to the assessment and that period of time must be between 10 and 12 minutes;</li>
  <li>the total period of time spent by each Learner in taking such assessments shall be –
    <ul>
      <li>for foundation tier assessments, between seven and nine minutes, and</li>
      <li>for higher tier assessments, between 10 and 12 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Within such an assessment, in relation to each task requiring a Learner to read aloud a short written text, an awarding organisation must ensure that the length of that text is –</p>

<ul>
  <li>for foundation tier assessments, a minimum of 35 words, and</li>
  <li>for higher tier assessments, a minimum of 50 words.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding spoken extracts</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must design and set each assessment of a Learner’s ability to understand spoken French, German or Spanish effectively (which does not also assess the Learner’s ability to speak the language effectively) on the basis that the total number words across all spoken extracts in such an assessment is –</p>

<ul>
  <li>for foundation tier assessments, between 450 and 500 words, and</li>
  <li>for higher tier assessments, between 700 and 850 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must demonstrate to Ofqual’s satisfaction its approach to assessing understanding of spoken extracts in relation to –</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of extracts used,</li>
  <li>the number of words in each extract,</li>
  <li>the number of marks available in relation to the number of words in each extract, and</li>
  <li>the approach to allowing a Learner sufficient opportunities to read the tasks before hearing the extracts.</li>
</ul>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must set out its approach to meeting the requirements of paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Content Document in relating to complexity of language and question types in the assessment of understanding spoken extracts.</p>

<h3>Dictation</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must design and set each assessment of a Learner’s ability to take dictation of spoken French, German or Spanish effectively on the basis that each short spoken extract for dictation shall be –</p>

<ul>
  <li>for foundation tier assessments, a minimum of 20 words, and</li>
  <li>for higher tier assessments, a minimum of 30 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must set out its approach to dictation assessments, including reference to the sound-symbol correspondence list in the Subject Content, its approach to different languages and the level of accuracy required</p>

<h3>Understanding written language</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must design and set each assessment of a Learner’s ability to understand written French, German or Spanish effectively on the basis that (excluding the translation tasks) the number of words across all texts in such assessments shall be –</p>

<ul>
  <li>for foundation tier assessments, between 600 and 650 words, and</li>
  <li>for higher tier assessments, between 850 and 900 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the above total word limits, an awarding organisation must ensure that in each assessment of a Learner’s ability to understand written French, German or Spanish effectively there shall be –</p>

<ul>
  <li>for foundation tier assessments, a maximum of 7 texts (excluding the translation tasks), with a maximum number of words in any single text of 100 words, and</li>
  <li>for higher tier assessments, a maximum of 8 texts (excluding the translation tasks), with a maximum number of words in any single text of 160 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must set out its approach to meeting the requirements of paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Content Document, in relation to complexity of language and question types in the assessment of understanding written extracts.</p>

<h3>Translation</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must design and set each assessment of a Learner’s ability to translate short sentences or texts in French, German or Spanish to English, and vice versa, on the basis that such sentences or texts shall be –</p>

<ul>
  <li>for foundation tier assessments, a minimum of 35 words, and</li>
  <li>for higher tier assessments, a minimum of 50 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>In its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation must set out its approach to meeting the requirements of paragraph 9e of the Content Document, in relation to ‘a range of the vocabulary and grammar specified for each tier’ and to ‘an appropriate and sufficient rendering of the meaning of the original language’.</p>
