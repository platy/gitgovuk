<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>New subject content</h3>

<p>In November 2019, the Department for Education (DfE) announced that it would be convening an independent expert panel to develop potential changes to the subject content for GCSE French, German and Spanish. The proposed subject content was subject to a 10-week public consultation between March 2021 and May 2021.</p>

<p>In January 2022, following review of the consultation responses and wider stakeholder feedback, DfE published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-french-german-and-spanish-subject-content">the new GCSE French, German and Spanish subject content</a>.</p>

<p>DfE also confirmed that the new qualifications will be available for first teaching from September 2024, with first assessments in summer 2026.</p>

<h3>Assessment arrangements</h3>

<p>Ofqual reviewed the requirements for assessing the proposed new content, which the exam boards offering GCSE qualifications in French, German and Spanish must follow. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revised-gcse-qualifications-in-modern-foreign-languages">We published a consultation seeking views on our assessment</a> proposals at the same time as the DfE consulted on its proposed subject content.</p>

<p>Also in January 2022, having considered the responses to our public consultation, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/revised-gcse-qualifications-in-modern-foreign-languages">we confirmed that we had decided to implement our proposals.</a> This means that the arrangements for assessing the revised GCSEs in French, German and Spanish will be based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>revised assessment objectives (AOs), which set out the percentage of qualification marks that must be awarded for each aspect of assessment</li>
  <li>continued use of tiered assessments, requiring students to be entered to a single tier across all assessments</li>
  <li>continued use of non-exam assessment (NEA) to focus on the assessment of speaking skills, which make up 25% of the total marks for the qualification</li>
</ul>

<h3>This consultation</h3>

<p>This consultation on the proposed subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance, covers the regulatory requirements that must be followed in all new GCSE qualifications in French, German and Spanish.</p>

<h2>Consultation details</h2>

<h3>Regulatory conditions</h3>

<p>In order to ensure that regulated qualifications meet our requirements to be valid, reliable and comparable in terms of level of challenge with other similar qualifications, Ofqual sets out specific rules, which we call ‘conditions’.</p>

<p>All of the qualifications that we regulate must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook">General Conditions of Recognition</a>. For some qualifications, such as GCSEs, we set qualification-level conditions and guidance, which apply to all qualifications of that type. We also set subject-level conditions and guidance for some qualifications of a particular type in a particular subject. GCSE qualifications must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-9-to-1-qualification-level-conditions">GCSE qualification level conditions</a>, as well as with the subject-level conditions which reflect the specific subject content document developed by the Department for Education (DfE).</p>

<p>Each set of conditions is accompanied by a guidance document, which supports the rules and helps exam boards understand how to comply with them. When developing a regulated qualification, exam boards must have regard to the guidance that sits alongside the conditions. This means they must consider the guidance and, if they choose not to follow the guidance, they must explain how the alternative approach taken will also meet the regulatory conditions.</p>

<p>Exam boards are required to present this information to Ofqual in their assessment strategy, which is a confidential, commercially sensitive document that sets out how they will ensure they remain compliant with the conditions that apply for that qualification. The GCSE qualification level conditions require exam boards to maintain an assessment strategy, with guidance about what we expect from these documents presented in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-9-to-1-qualification-level-guidance">GCSE qualification level guidance</a>.</p>

<p>In light of the new subject content for GCSE French, German and Spanish we are now consulting on new subject-level conditions and guidance for those qualifications.</p>

<h3>Consistency with current requirements for GCSE modern foreign languages</h3>

<p>The new subject content for GCSE French, German and Spanish has many similarities with the current subject content for modern foreign languages (MFL). The new content includes the assessment of listening, speaking, reading and writing as well as translation skills, and the content specifies elements that must be covered by foundation tier and higher tier assessments.</p>

<p>The current subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance for GCSEs in French, German and Spanish (and other modern foreign languages) largely work well. Therefore, where the content requirements of the new GCSEs in French, German and Spanish are consistent with the current content requirements, we are proposing to use the same assessment requirements as those that apply to the current qualifications.</p>

<p>Examples of regulatory requirements that will be carried through to the new GCSE French, Spanish and German qualifications include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance to ensure qualifications follow the required subject content, assessment objectives, and assessment requirements. These conditions are common to many GCSEs.</li>
  <li>subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance to implement the assessment arrangements for GCSE French, German and Spanish that were confirmed in the decisions published in January 2022 relating to the continuation of the current requirements to use non-exam assessment (NEA) and to use tiered assessments.</li>
  <li>More detailed subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance such as word counts for translation passages, or the time required to prepare for or assess spoken language skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>The assessment objectives we confirmed in January were designed to reflect the new content requirements, to allow more flexibility in the assessment approach, and to support progression to modern foreign languages at AS and A level.</p>

<h3>New requirements for GCSE French, German and Spanish</h3>

<p>Some of the new content requirements necessitate a change to the current assessment requirements. One such change is in the approach to assessing understanding of spoken language (listening).</p>

<p>The current GCSE MFL content requirements and assessment objectives encourage a qualification structure which assesses the four language skills separately (reading, writing, listening, speaking).</p>

<p>However, the new subject content and assessment objectives for GCSE French, German and Spanish allow more flexibility in the assessment structure (permitting, but not requiring mixed skill assessments). These new content and assessment requirements, along with consideration of stakeholder feedback regarding the volume of information students must absorb in the assessments, have led us to review our approach to setting out requirements for listening activities.</p>

<p>In the current GCSE MFL qualifications, the assessment of understanding spoken language is carried out in one distinct assessment paper. This means for these qualifications it is appropriate to stipulate that the assessment of understanding spoken language must last a certain number of minutes (35 mins at foundation tier, 45 mins at higher tier, both inclusive of 5 minutes reading time).</p>

<p>As the new GCSE French, German and Spanish qualifications have a more flexible assessment structure, requiring that assessments last a certain number of minutes may not be appropriate or practicable should exam boards choose to develop assessments that target a mix of language skills rather than each skill separately. Therefore, to ensure a consistent approach to understanding spoken language regardless of how the assessments are structured, we propose to stipulate a permitted range of the number of words to be used in the assessment of this skill (450 to 500 at foundation tier, 700 to 850 at higher tier).</p>

<p>We propose to require exam boards to explain in their assessment strategies their approach to assessing the understanding of spoken extracts. This must cover the number of extracts students must respond to, the number of words per extract and the number of marks to be awarded in relation to the length of each extract. In addition, exam boards will be required to set out how students will have enough time to read the questions before responding to them.</p>

<p>The new subject content has also led us to propose assessment requirements for new areas, such as greater focus on the vocabulary and grammar of the language, and for new kinds of tasks.</p>

<p>In developing our proposals, we have considered the aims of the subject content and we have drawn on feedback gathered on the GCSE MFL assessments from teachers, teaching associations and exam boards. New proposed requirements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance to cover the assessment of new content requirements, such as tasks to be covered in the assessment of speaking, stimuli to be used in written tasks, and the approach to the assessment of both dictation and inferring plausible meanings of single words from outside the vocabulary list.</li>
  <li>subject-level conditions, requirements and guidance to ensure a consistent approach is taken to compiling and presenting the vocabulary list and the grammar requirements including the sound-symbol correspondences</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposed subject level conditions</h3>

<h4>Condition 1 - Compliance with content requirements</h4>

<p>This condition is consistent with the current requirements for GCSE modern foreign languages (MFL). It requires qualifications to comply with the subject content.</p>

<h4>Condition 2 - Assessing the full range of abilities</h4>

<p>This condition is consistent with the current requirements for GCSE modern foreign languages (MFL). It requires these qualifications to be tiered.</p>

<h4>Condition 3 - Assessment</h4>

<p>This condition is consistent with the current requirements for GCSE modern foreign languages (MFL). It requires awarding organisations to comply with our requirements and have regard to our guidance.</p>

<h4>Condition 4 – Assessment of spoken language</h4>

<p>This condition is consistent with the current requirements for GCSE modern foreign languages (MFL). It requires the assessment of spoken language to take place by means other than exams and sets some parameters around this.</p>

<h4>Condition 5 – Access to dictionaries</h4>

<p>This condition is consistent with the current requirements for GCSE modern foreign languages (MFL). It prevents awarding organisations from allowing access to a dictionary during assessments.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>

<p>Do you have any comments on the proposed subject level conditions?</p>
</div>

<h3>Proposed requirements</h3>

<h4>Tiering requirements - GCSE Qualifications in French, German and Spanish</h4>

<p>We have already confirmed that all assessments in the new qualifications will be tiered with students required to enter all assessments at the same tier (all foundation tier or all higher tier).</p>

<h4>Assessment requirements - GCSE Qualifications in French, German and Spanish</h4>

<p>We are proposing a number of requirements for the assessment of GCSE French, German and Spanish relating to the following.</p>

<h5>Grammar and sound-symbol correspondence</h5>

<p><strong>Updated</strong> requirements reflecting the new subject content, and a <strong>new</strong> requirement for awarding organisations to set out in their assessment strategies their approach to covering grammar and sound-symbol correspondence requirements.</p>

<h5>Vocabulary</h5>

<p><strong>Updated</strong> requirements reflecting the new subject content, and a <strong>new</strong> requirement for awarding organisations to set out in their assessment strategies their approach to covering the required vocabulary.</p>

<h5>Speaking assessment</h5>

<p>Requirements for the time spent by students taking such assessments are <strong>unchanged</strong> from the current qualifications. We have proposed <strong>new</strong> requirements about the length of tasks requiring students to read aloud a short written text.</p>

<h5>Understanding spoken extracts</h5>

<p><strong>New</strong> requirements, replacing the current stipulations about time limits for these assessments with new stipulations about number of words to be used in the assessment of this skill. Also <strong>new</strong> requirements for awarding organisations to set out in their assessment strategies a range of approaches to the assessment.</p>

<h5>Dictation</h5>

<p><strong>New</strong> requirements about the length of short spoken extracts for dictation, and a <strong>new</strong> requirement for awarding organisations to set out in their assessment strategies their approaches to these assessments, including how they will meet content requirements.</p>

<h5>Understanding written language</h5>

<p><strong>New</strong> requirements about word limits and number of texts used in assessments, and a <strong>new</strong> requirement for awarding organisations to set out in their assessment strategies their approaches to meeting content requirements for these assessments.</p>

<h5>Translation</h5>

<p><strong>New</strong> requirements about the number of words in short sentences or texts for translation, and a <strong>new</strong> requirement for awarding organisations to set out in their assessment strategies their approaches to meeting content requirements for these assessments.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>

<p>Do you have any comments on the proposed Requirements?</p>
</div>

<h3>Proposed subject level guidance</h3>

<p>We are also proposing new statutory guidance, which includes the following.</p>

<h4>Assessment of speaking</h4>

<p>Guidance on the nature of follow up questions, role-plays and the unprepared interaction.</p>

<h4>Assessment of writing</h4>

<p>Guidance on the stimuli for written tasks.</p>

<h4>Infer meaning</h4>

<p>Guidance on the words Learners are required to infer.</p>

<h4>Dictation of short spoken extracts</h4>

<p>Guidance on the extract to be used in the dictation assessment.</p>

<p>We have also developed guidance on the new assessment objectives.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 3</strong></p>

<p>Do you have any comments on the proposed subject level guidance?</p>
</div>

<h2>Equality impact assessment</h2>

<p>As Ofqual is a public body, we must comply with the public sector equality duty in section 149(1) of the Equality Act 2010. In developing these proposals, we have considered the likely impact on persons who share particular protected characteristics.</p>

<p>We are required to have due regard to the need to:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a) eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>b) advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it</li>
  <li>c) foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it</li>
</ol>

<p>In our earlier consultation on the assessment arrangements for these qualifications, we explained that we had not identified any impacts of our proposals (positive or negative) on persons who share the protected characteristics of age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Nothing in the responses to that consultation gave us cause to change our view. In designing these subject level conditions and guidance, which reflect the assessment arrangements we decided on, we have again considered the impacts of our proposals, and have not identified any impacts of our proposals (positive or negative) on persons because of their protected characteristics of age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 4</strong></p>

<p>We have set out our view that our proposals would not impact (positively or negatively) on students who share a particular protected characteristic. Are there any potential impacts that we have not identified?</p>

<p><strong>Question 5</strong></p>

<p>Are there any additional steps we could take to mitigate any negative impact you have identified from our proposals, on students who share a protected characteristic?</p>
</div>

<h2>Regulatory impact assessment</h2>

<p>In a regulatory impact assessment, we consider the activities resulting from the proposals that we expect may give rise to additional costs and regulatory burdens, as well as any activities that may not take place and could therefore deliver savings.</p>

<p>We know that the process of designing, developing and delivering a new or revised qualification has impacts on schools, colleges and exam boards. In our previous consultation on the assessment arrangements for these qualifications we identified the expected impacts. Respondents identified one potential cost for schools and colleges which we had not mentioned – the cost of purchasing new textbooks or other materials to support the delivery of the new qualifications.</p>

<h3>Impact on schools and colleges</h3>

<p>We expect there would be one-off, direct costs and administrative burdens to schools and colleges associated with the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarisation with new qualifications, assessments and guidance from exam boards</li>
  <li>communication to, and training for, teaching staff on the new assessments</li>
  <li>buying new textbooks and resources to support the delivery of the new assessments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact on exam boards</h3>

<p>The proposed arrangements apply to GCSE qualifications regulated by Ofqual, in French, German and Spanish.</p>

<p>We expect there would be one-off, direct costs and administrative burdens to these organisations associated with the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarisation with the revised subject level conditions and guidance published by Ofqual on the approach to assessing the revised qualifications</li>
  <li>research with stakeholders into potential approaches to assessment</li>
  <li>development of new specifications and sample assessments and mark schemes in each language</li>
  <li>information and training to centres about the revised assessments</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst we acknowledge that these costs or regulatory burdens may be introduced through the design, development and delivery of the new qualifications, we think such impacts or burdens are necessary to ensure that the new qualifications meet the government’s expectations and our regulatory requirements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 6</strong></p>

<p>We have set out our understanding of the cost implications and burdens of our proposals for schools, colleges and exam boards. Are there any other potential costs or regulatory burdens that we have not identified?</p>

<p><strong>Question 7</strong></p>

<p>Are there any additional steps we could take to reduce the costs or regulatory burdens of our proposals?</p>
</div>

<p>We may share your response, in full, with The Department for Education (DfE) and The Institute for Apprenticeships &amp; Technical Education (IFATE) where the consultation is part of work involving those organisations. We may need to share responses with them to ensure that our approach aligns with the wider process.</p>

<p>Where possible, if we share a response, we will not include any personal data (if you have provided any). Where we have received a response to the consultation from an organisation, we will provide the DfE and IFATE with the name of the organisation that has provided the response, although we will consider requests for confidentiality.</p>

<p>Where we share data, we ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that your rights and freedoms are not affected.</p>

<p>We use Citizen Space, which is part of Delib Limited, to collect consultation responses and they act as our data processor. You can view <a class="govuk-link" href="https://app.citizenspace.com/privacy_policy/" rel="external">Citizen Space’s privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>Your response will also be shared internally within Ofqual in order to analyse the responses and shape our policies and regulatory activity. We use third party software to produce analysis reports, which may require hosting of data outside the UK, specifically the US. Please note that limited personal information is shared. All personal contact information is removed during this process. Where we transfer any personal data outside the UK, we make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure that the personal data is protected and kept secure.</p>

<p>Following the end of the consultation, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ofqual">we will publish an analysis of responses on our website</a>. We will not include personal details in the responses that we publish.</p>

<p>We may also publish an annex to the analysis listing all organisations that responded but will not include personal names or other contact details.</p>

<h3>How long we will keep your personal data</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, Ofqual will keep your personal data (if provided) for a period of 2 years after the consultation closing date.</p>

<h3>Our legal basis for processing your personal data</h3>

<p>Where you provide personal data for this consultation, we are relying upon the public task basis as set out in Article 6(1)(e) of UK GDPR to process personal data which allows processing of personal data when this is necessary for the performance of our public tasks. We will consult where there is a statutory duty to consult or where there is a legitimate expectation that a process of consultation will take place. Where you provide special category data, we process sensitive personal data such as ethnicity and disability, we rely on Article 9(2)(g) of UK GDPR as processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.</p>

<h2>Annex B – Ofqual’s role, objectives and duties</h2>

<h3>The Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009</h3>

<p>Ofqual has five statutory objectives, set out in the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009;</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>1) <strong>The qualification standards objective</strong>, which is to secure that the qualifications we regulate:
    <ol>
      <li>a) give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and understanding; and</li>
      <li>b) indicate:
        <ol>
          <li>i) a consistent level of attainment (including over time) between comparable regulated qualifications; and</li>
          <li>ii) a consistent level of attainment (but not over time) between qualifications we regulate and comparable qualifications (including those awarded outside of the UK) that we do not regulate</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>2) <strong>The assessment standards objective,</strong> which is to promote the development and implementation of regulated assessment arrangements which:
    <ol>
      <li>i) give a reliable indication of achievement, and</li>
      <li>ii) indicate a consistent level of attainment (including over time) between comparable assessments</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>3) <strong>The public confidence objective,</strong> which is to promote public confidence in regulated qualifications and regulated assessment arrangements</li>
  <li>4) <strong>The awareness objective,</strong> which is to promote awareness and understanding of:
    <ol>
      <li>a) the range of regulated qualifications available,</li>
      <li>b) the benefits of regulated qualifications to Students, employers and institutions within the higher education sector, and</li>
      <li>c) the benefits of recognition to bodies awarding or authenticating qualifications</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>5) <strong>The efficiency objective,</strong> which is to secure that regulated qualifications are provided efficiently, and that any relevant sums payable to a body awarding or authenticating a qualification represent value for money.</li>
</ol>

<p>We must therefore regulate so that qualifications properly differentiate between Students who have demonstrated that they have the knowledge, skills and understanding required to attain the qualification and those who have not.</p>

<p>We also have a duty under the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 to have regard to the reasonable requirements of relevant Students, including those with special educational needs and disabilities, of employers and of the higher education sector, and to aspects of government policy when so directed by the Secretary of State.</p>

<h3>The Equality Act 2010</h3>

<p>As a public body, we are subject to the public sector equality duty. This duty requires us to have due regard to the need to:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a) eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited under the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>b) advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it</li>
  <li>c) foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it</li>
</ol>

<p>The awarding organisations that design, deliver and award qualifications are required by the Equality Act, among other things, to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people taking their qualifications, except where we have specified that such adjustments should not be made.</p>

<p>When we decide whether such adjustments should not be made, we must have regard to:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>a) the need to minimise the extent to which disabled persons are disadvantaged in attaining the qualification because of their disabilities</li>
  <li>b) the need to secure that the qualification gives a reliable indication of the knowledge, skills and understanding of a person upon whom it is conferred</li>
  <li>c) the need to maintain public confidence in the qualification</li>
</ol>

<p>We are subject to a number of duties and we must aim to achieve a number of objectives. These different duties and objectives can, sometimes conflict with each other. For example, if we regulate to secure that a qualification gives a reliable indication of a student’s knowledge, skills and understanding, a student who has not been able to demonstrate the required knowledge, skills and/or understanding will not be awarded the qualification.</p>

<p>A person may find it more difficult, or impossible, to demonstrate the required knowledge, skills and/or understanding because they have a protected characteristic. This could put them at a disadvantage relative to others who have been awarded the qualification.</p>

<p>It is not always possible for us to regulate so that qualifications give a reliable indication of knowledge, skills and understanding and advance equality between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not. We must review all the available evidence and actively consider all the available options before coming to a final, justifiable decision.</p>

<p>Qualifications cannot mitigate inequalities or unfairness in the education system or in society more widely that might affect, for example, students’ preparedness to take the qualification and the assessments within it. While a wide range of factors can have an impact on a student’s ability to achieve a particular assessment, our influence is limited to the qualification design and assessment.</p>

<p>We require awarding bodies to design qualifications that give a reliable indication of the knowledge, skills and understanding of the students that take them. We also require awarding organisations to avoid, where possible, features of a qualification that could, without justification, make a qualification more difficult for a student to achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic. We require awarding organisations to monitor whether any features of their qualifications have this effect.</p>

<p>In setting our proposed requirements, we want to understand the possible impacts of the proposals on students who share a protected characteristic. The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>marriage and civil partnerships</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
  <li>race</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to the public sector equality duty under section 149 of the Equality Act, we are not required to have due regard to impacts on those who are married or in a civil partnership.</p>
