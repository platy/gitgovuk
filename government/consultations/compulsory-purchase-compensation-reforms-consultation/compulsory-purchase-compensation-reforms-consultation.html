<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1. Compulsory purchase is the power to acquire land and property without the consent of the owner. It is an important tool for assembling land needed to help deliver social, environmental and economic change.</p>

<p>2. The governmentâs high street strategy, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/build-back-better-high-streets">Build Back Better High Streets</a>, published in July 2021, emphasised the role of compulsory purchase as a catalyst for regeneration in town centres and high streets which are seeing persistent long-term empty properties, and where there are complex and fragmented land ownership patterns. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom">Levelling Up White Paper</a> published in February 2022 made it clear that we want local communities to be empowered to take the lead and ensure they have the tools to succeed.</p>

<p>3. To facilitate this, we want to see a faster, more efficient compulsory purchase system that acquiring authorities are confident in using and that produces the right outcomes to bring forward much needed development including for housing, regeneration and infrastructure. We are therefore, bringing forward reforms to help streamline and modernise the process for compulsory purchase orders (<abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr>) and to give local authorities in England clearer enabling powers to use <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> for regeneration purposes. These measures are in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3155" rel="external">Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill</a> which is currently being considered by Parliament and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the introduction of conditional confirmations of CPOs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ability for compulsory purchase powers under CPOs to be exercised within a longer period than 3 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>giving inspectors the ability to choose the appropriate procedure to confirm a <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provisions to digitalise the <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> process; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clarification that the compulsory purchase powers of a local authority include using those powers for regeneration purposes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4. At the same time, we also want to ensure that schemes that need to rely on compulsory purchase are viable and deliver the benefits that are necessary in the public interest. We are therefore also proposing to make changes to the compensation provisions associated with compulsory purchase where valuation takes into account prospective planning permission. This consultation seeks your views on a specific proposal in this respect.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Background</h2>

<p>5. Compensation is payable to an affected owner of land or an interest where it is subject to compulsory purchase. The legislative framework around compensation is contained in a number of enactments, including the Land Compensation Act 1961 and the Land Compensation Act 1973, and has continually evolved over time. Collectively, it is known as the âcompensation codeâ although it is not set down in a single enactment.</p>

<p>6. Compensation will be payable wherever compulsory purchase occurs which may be through a <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> or other types of Order that can authorise compulsory purchase such as a Development Consent Order or a hybrid Bill.</p>

<p>7. There are 4 principal elements of compensation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the open market value of the interest in land to be acquired</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>âdisturbanceâ payments for losses not directly based on the value of land (e.g. removal costs, professional fees, stamp duty)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loss payments for the distress and inconvenience of claimants being compelled to sell and/or relocate at a time not of their choosing; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>severance and injurious affection for retained land</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8. This consultation focuses on the first of these principles: on the open market value of the interest in land to be acquired. Rule 2 of section 5 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 (<abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961) defines this as the amount which the land if sold on the open market by a willing seller might be expected realise, subject to the other provisions of that Act. This is assessed in light of the no-scheme principle set out in section 6A <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961. Under the no-scheme principle, any increases or decreases in the value of the land attributable to the underlying âschemeâ e.g. regeneration project, new settlement, trunk road etc. or the prospect of that scheme, are disregarded.</p>

<p>9. Section 14 <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961 makes provision for taking account of actual or prospective planning permission in assessing the open market value under rule 2. Value attributed to prospective planning permission is sometimes referred to as âhope valueâ. Section 17 further allows for certificates of appropriate alternative development to be issued in respect of appropriate alternative development (<abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr>) under section 14.</p>

<p>10. The assessment of the value of land in the context of the viability of sites is contained in the governmentâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/viability">guidance on Viability</a> where the concepts of existing use value, existing use value plus and alternative use value are set out. Broadly, existing use value is based on the current use of the land. Existing use value plus allows a premium as a reasonable incentive for a landowner to bring forward land for development while allowing a sufficient contribution to fully comply with policy requirements. Alternative use value reflects the value of land for uses other than its existing use which would fully comply with up-to-date development plan policies.</p>

<p>11. Compensation claims for the value attributed to prospective planning permission and the costs associated with those claims have attracted significant attention in recent years. In September 2018, the Select Committee report on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcomloc/766/766.pdf" rel="external">Land Value Capture</a> recommended changes to the <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961 and that increases in the value of privately-owned land arising from public policy decisions should be shared with the local community.</p>

<p>12. The government is clear that those affected by compulsory purchase should be entitled to a fair value for their interest. Determining value necessarily requires an element of judgment and where hope value is claimed it can be hard to find comparables, particularly in the no-scheme world. However, we want to ensure that the compensation code does not lead to elevated levels of compensation and costs being paid for prospective planning permission that would result in more than a fair value being paid.</p>

<p>13. Currently, a landowner has 2 different ways of claiming hope value either reflecting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the prospect of a planning permission being granted on their land (section 14(2)(b) <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961); or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> for which planning permission may be assumed if <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> is established (section 14(3) and section 14(4) <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>14. For the latter, landowners may choose to apply to the local planning authority for a certificate of appropriate alternative development (<abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr>) â the costs of which are generally borne by the acquiring authority.</p>

<p>15. Where <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> is established either for the relevant valuation date or a later date, section 14(3) <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961 provides that it may be assumed that planning permission is in force on the relevant date. This leads to perverse outcomes: for instance, a requirement to assume 100% planning certainty for <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> when the planning likelihood may only be 51%. This artificially inflates compensation because a transaction in normal market conditions would reflect the actual risk associated with the likelihood of planning permission being granted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Our approach to compensation</h2>

<p>16. We want to correct this to ensure that the balance of compensation and costs in relation to hope value is right. At the same time, we want to simplify the process for obtaining a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr>. We intend, therefore, to amend sections 14 and 17 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reflect normal market conditions in compensation payments by only allowing the equivalent of planning certainty for appropriate alternative development if a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr> is obtained in relation to that <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
    <p>establish a single route for determining hope value based on the likelihood of <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr>, taking into account the assumptions in section 14(5) <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>remove the requirement that acquiring authorities pay the costs of landowners in seeking a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr> â if a landowner chooses to seek a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr> then they can do so at their own cost and weigh the risks in doing so against the benefits to value that may materialise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>further streamline the process for obtaining a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr> so that the ask on local planning authorities is simpler and clearer â local authorities will be asked to only issue a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr> in relation to the type(s) of <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> applied for</p>
  </li>
  <li>address the issue raised in Lockwood v Highways England Company Limited around the date of determination of a <abbr title="certificate of appropriate alternative development">CAAD</abbr> where the relevant valuation date has not yet occurred</li>
</ul>

<p>17. The combination of these changes will mean that assessment of value attributable to the likelihood of alternative development is more akin to normal market conditions and rebalance the position on costs and compensation between landowner and acquiring authority to a fairer one. We intend to bring forward these reforms to the compensation provisions as amendments in the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill.</p>

<p>18. These reforms would apply generally to all compulsory purchase schemes and would apply to England and Wales.</p>

<p>19. The Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill already contains provision to amend the definition of the âschemeâ for the purposes of the no-scheme principle. It amends sections 6D and 6E <abbr title="Land Compensation Act">LCA</abbr> 1961 to ensure that where greenfield land is acquired for development which is made possible by a relevant transport project, then that scheme will include the relevant transport project.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Further reform</h2>

<p>20. We recognise, however, that there have been calls to go further than this and allow authorities to acquire land at or closer to existing use value. The arguments are broadly that acquisition of land at or closer to existing use value would enable more land value to be captured and then invested for the public benefit in the schemes, for example ensuring the viability of a scheme that may otherwise not be able to come forward or to support greater levels of affordable housing or enhanced infrastructure improvements. The September 2018 Select Committee report on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcomloc/766/766.pdf" rel="external">Land Value Capture</a>, at paragraphs 91 to 109, sets out these arguments in more detail.</p>

<p>21. This consultation outlines a proposal as to how that may be achieved. However, we would also welcome further evidence and examples of how paying closer to existing use value for properties may be in the public interest. This may be through the delivery of schemes that would otherwise be unviable, or the delivery of improved outcomes from a scheme.</p>

<p>22. We have asked questions below, as well as having them as a consolidated list in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-consultation-questions">Annex A</a> of this consultation paper. Questions 1 and 2 are in Annex A and ask for respondentâs details. Where providing examples, please make it clear where you regard any information as commercially confidential and note the contents of <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-about-this-consultation">Annex B</a> of this consultation in relation to this.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Do you agree that there are schemes where capping or removing the payment of hope value will increase the viability of certain schemes and/or increase the public benefits delivered through the schemes? Please provide details and where possible examples of schemes.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Please provide any comments you may have as to the proportionality of capping or removing the payment of hope value balanced against the delivery of public benefits. Please provide any examples you have where you believe the public benefits would be such that it would be proportionate to impose such a cap or removal of hope value to a scheme and what those public benefits may be.</p>

<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Do you have evidence of the extent to which hope value is currently claimed/paid generally in compulsory purchase situations? Please provide details and where possible any evidence that you have as to whether hope value is more likely to be paid on particular types of schemes, for example from urban regeneration schemes to greenfield schemes or from housing schemes to transport schemes.</p>

<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> Do you think there are more likely to be measurable public benefits in capping or removing hope value in particular types of scheme? Do you think any solution to this issue should be limited to individual schemes, particular types of scheme or apply across all types of compulsory purchase situations? Please provide details in support of your answers.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Consultation proposal</h2>

<p>23. The government have carefully considered the balance of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>acquiring land at a fair value and the human rights considerations of landowners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring that schemes for the public benefit are deliverable and the enhancement opportunities which arise from them are maximised</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimising the impact of changes on the overall compulsory purchase system</p>
  </li>

<p>24. We are proposing a further measure to allow acquiring authorities to request a direction from the Secretary of State that, for a specific scheme, payments in respect of hope value may be capped at existing use value or an amount above existing use value where it can be shown that the public interest in doing so would be justified.</p>

<p>25. Where directions are issued, they would provide upfront certainty for an acquiring authority as to the levels of hope value that would be payable for the relevant scheme. Schemes would then have more confidence in their property cost estimates and consequently more certainty over the viability of the scheme and its ability to deliver the relevant benefits in the public interest. It would avoid lengthy disputes over the amount of hope value payable and uncertainty years into the development of a scheme as to how much compensation may be payable in respect of prospective planning permission, particularly where the viability of the scheme or the delivery of the benefits of the scheme depend on the value paid for the underlying land.</p>

<p>26. Landowners would remain entitled to a fair price for their land. No-one would be paid less than existing use value and, where a cap above existing use value was directed, they would remain entitled to hope value up to the cap where hope value was evidenced. Determining the value of land and therefore a fair price requires an element of judgment. Directions will provide certainty to parties in determining that value and potentially avoid high levels of costs in debating value. Landowners would also continue to receive all other compensation payments that they would be eligible for.</p>

<p>27. It is the governmentâs intention that the ability to seek a direction would only apply to acquiring authorities that are also public sector entities. Acquiring authorities may be either public sector entities like local authorities or, in some circumstances, private companies like airport operators or utilities companies. The public interest in seeking directions is likely to be higher where they are sought by public sector entities. In addition, public sector entities are subject to the public sector equality duty under the Equality Act 2010 and will need to take that into account when considering whether to apply for directions.</p>

<p>28. The government considered whether changes to the assessment of the value attributable to prospective planning permission could be made generally or in relation to specific types of <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> or schemes. However, even within types of <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> or schemes the public interest justification may vary considerably. By allowing acquiring authorities to apply for directions in relation to their specific schemes, this will mean schemes where hope value is not a material consideration will not be affected. The provision could also be flexible allowing it to be available to any type of <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr>.</p>

<p>29. An option for the framework of seeking a direction might be as follows:</p>

<p><strong>a.</strong> Before a public sector acquiring authority:</p>

<p>a. makes a <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr>; or<br>
   b. applies for other types of Order seeking compulsory purchase powers,</p>

<p>it may apply for a direction from the Secretary of State in relation to a specific scheme.</p>

<p><strong>b.</strong> The direction sought may, in relation to the proposed scheme, have the effect of:</p>

<p>a. taking no account of <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> in a valuation; or<br>
   b. limiting the payment of any effect of <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> to no more than a specific percentage over the existing use value.</p>

<p><strong>c.</strong> In seeking a direction from the Secretary of State, the authority would need to:</p>

<p>a. identify the scheme;<br>
   b. provide details of the estimated land value that would be captured as a result of issuing a direction for the scheme; and<br>
   c. evidence how that land value would be applied to the scheme for the public benefit and/or how certainty over the level of compensation payments in respect of prospective planning permission will benefit the scheme.</p>

<p><strong>d.</strong> In considering an application for a direction then Secretary of State may appoint a person with requisite expertise to make a recommendation as to whether to issue a direction.</p>

<p><strong>e.</strong> Any disputed compensation that relates to <abbr title="appropriate alternative development">AAD</abbr> would be settled by the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) on the basis of the terms of the direction.</p>

<p>30. As part of this consultation, we would welcome further comments about the steps that could be required before any such directions are issued. Directions may be challenged in the courts as with other decisions/acts of public authorities.</p>

<p>31. This proposed approach follows a similar, more limited, one contained in section 50 Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 where a direction for minimum compensation can be sought from the Secretary of State in the case of a listed building deliberately left derelict that is being compulsorily acquired under section 47 of that Act.</p>

<p>32. The ability to seek such directions would apply to England and Wales.</p>

<p>33. We would welcome your views on this proposal. We have asked questions below, as well as having them as a consolidated list in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-consultation-questions">Annex A</a> of this consultation paper. Where providing examples, please make it clear where you regard any information as commercially confidential and note the contents of <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-about-this-consultation">Annex B</a> of this consultation in relation to this.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 7:</strong> Do you agree with the proposal to address this through the issue of directions for specific schemes as set out in this consultation?</p>

<p><strong>Question 8:</strong> Do you agree with the proposal that the directions could cap the payment of compensation at existing use value or at a percentage above existing use value (excluding the payment of compensation under other heads of claim)?</p>

<p><strong>Question 9:</strong> Please provide any comments you may have as to: (1) whether it will be possible to identify certain, deliverable public benefits in applying for directions; (2) how it will be possible to link those public benefits to value captured.</p>

<p><strong>Question 10:</strong> Do you think that an acquiring authority should have to consult with affected landowners before seeking a direction from the Secretary of State?</p>

<p><strong>Question 11:</strong> Do you agree that issuing directions should only be to schemes where the acquiring authority is also a public sector entity (and subject to the public sector equality duty)?</p>

<p><strong>Question 12:</strong> It might be possible for landowners to seek a planning permission so that development value applies under section 14(2)(a) LCA 1961 circumventing any cap applied under a direction. Do you think it should be possible for the directions to cap development value for any planning permission which falls under section 14(2)(a) where that planning permission is made after the âlaunch dateâ of the scheme or after the date the directions are issued if later? The launch date is defined by section 14(6) LCA 1961.</p>

<p><strong>Question 13:</strong> Do you have any further comments as to how the process of seeking and issuing directions might work?</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Alternative proposals</h2>

<p>34. Alternative proposals to address the concerns set out in this consultation have previously been proposed by others including those provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://old.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local-government-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/land-value-capture-inquiry-17-19/publications/" rel="external">evidence</a> to the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee in 2018. The government have carefully considered other proposals and its preferred approach is set out in this consultation.</p>

<p>35. However, we would welcome views as to whether the proposals set out should go further and look to cap or remove hope value generally or in relation to specific types of schemes. Where providing examples, please make it clear where you regard any information as commercially confidential and note the contents of <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-about-this-consultation">Annex B</a> of this consultation in relation to this.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 14:</strong> Do you think the proposals should go further and automatically limit the payment of hope value in compulsory purchase more generally or in relation to specific types of schemes? Please provide details and justification as to why you think it would be in the public interest to go further and what public benefits could be delivered if hope value was limited. Examples of types of schemes, for example regeneration, you think any further general application should apply to would also be helpful.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Equality impact assessment</h2>

<p>36. Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 requires the government, when exercising its functions, to pay due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Act</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
  <li>foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
</ul>

<p>37. The relevant protected characteristics are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>marriage or civil partnership</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
  <li>race</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>38. Compulsory purchase can have an equalities impact and a particular scheme may have an adverse effect on persons with protected characteristics. Where a public sector acquiring authority considers whether to make a <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> and a confirming authority decides whether to confirm a <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr>, as part of that decision making it will need to weigh up any adverse effect on persons with protected characteristics and the balance in the public interest of making or confirming the <abbr title="compulsory purchase order">CPO</abbr> against those adverse effects, sometimes to the advantage of those with protected characteristics.</p>

<p>39. Based on an initial analysis, although there is the potential for increased or new adverse effects on persons with protected characteristics arising from the issue of directions, there is equally the potential for increasing the beneficial effects of a scheme on persons with protected characteristics through improved outcomes to schemes. Our view is that the proposal allows for a full consideration of the equality impacts on a scheme-by-scheme basis before the issue of any directions.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 15:</strong> Do you have any comments on the initial equality analysis? If yes, please provide your views on the equality impacts arising from this proposal and any suggestions for how those impacts could be mitigated (please include any evidence you may have in support your views).</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Next steps</h2>

<p>40. The consultation will close on 19 July. Responses to this consultation will be analysed and a government response will follow. We will also be engaging the Welsh Government on the consultation.</p>

<p>41. Should the government decide, following consideration of the consultation responses, to take forward this proposal, our intention is for the power to make such directions to be introduced as an amendment to the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill.</p>
