<p>As part of the designs review, the government published a survey to supplement the call for views. The survey was aimed at stakeholders with a lower level of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> knowledge. The survey was published on gov.uk for 5 weeks. Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr>) bulletins and social media channels were used to reach as large a cross-section of designers as possible.</p>

<p>288 responses were received. Full analysis of the survey responses is set out below.</p>

<h3>Question 1 – How many people does your business employ?</h3>

<p>The vast majority of responses&nbsp;to the survey&nbsp;came from individual designers (58%) and micro-businesses with less than 10 employees (22.2%).</p>

<h3>Question 8 - What are the main reasons for registering your designs?</h3>

<p>There were 90 responses to this question. 65 (72%) said the main reason for design registration was the level of protection that a registered design provides. Many expressed the importance of design protection for their business, explaining that it is key for commercial success.</p>

<p>9 respondents (10%) felt that unregistered designs offered little to no protection and that the only option was to register their designs.</p>

<p>13 responses (15%) suggested that design protection is&nbsp;not fit for purpose, and the system was “inflexible, poor and outdated”.&nbsp;A further 5 (6%) responses expressed disappointment at the protection given by registration and stated that they no longer register their designs.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Question 10 and Question 11 - Were you aware that the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> does not perform checks on whether a design is similar to previous designs?
