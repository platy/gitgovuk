<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>On 28 July 2021, legislation came into force which introduced validation for antigen and molecular coronavirus (COVID-19) detection tests. The statutory instrument made under the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 requires antigen and molecular COVID-19 tests to undergo mandatory desktop review to assess their performance before being put into service, supplied, and permitted for sale on the UK market.</p>

<p>This call for evidence aims to support our understanding of the impact the Coronavirus Test Device Approval (<abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr>) process has had on the wider internal market, individual business and trade flow of antigen and molecular COVID-19 detection tests.</p>

<p>This will support the wider statutory review of the policy that will be reported on by 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>The call for evidence aims to obtain specific evidence in relation to businesses operating in the COVID-19 diagnostics market.</p>

<p>We are seeking evidence and opinions on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>costs for individual businesses involved in the domestic COVID-19 test kit sector</li>
  <li>scale and nature of domestic COVID-19 test kit activity, including manufacturing and trading</li>
  <li>scale and nature of activities abroad which are integral to our existing domestic COVID-19 test kit supply and market</li>
  <li>the direction of the COVID-19 test kit market</li>
  <li>how the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> objectives have been met and if they could be met more efficiently in future</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy notice</h2>

<p>The questions forming part of this review include requests for information which may be commercially sensitive. Such information will be used by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) for the purposes of this statutory review only. However, no commercially sensitive information will be published in the review itself. Any personal data (for example, names and email addresses) provided to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> as a result of responding to the questions below will be processed in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-privacy-notice"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s privacy notice</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We want to build our understanding of the economics of the COVID-19 testing market in the UK. To do this we need more information about both the broad strokes of supply and demand dynamics as well as the fine detail of business costs and individual behaviour around testing.</p>

<p>This call for evidence seeks substantive submissions from all interested stakeholders.</p>

<p>We would welcome submissions of both analysis and underlying calculations and evidence.</p>

<p>We welcome submissions on any or all the below broad areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>costs for individual businesses involved in the domestic COVID-19 test kit sector</li>
  <li>scale and nature of domestic COVID-19 test kit activity including manufacturing and trading</li>
  <li>scale and nature of activities abroad which are integral to our existing domestic COVID-19 test kit supply and market</li>
  <li>the direction of the COVID-19 test kit market</li>
  <li>how the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> objectives have been met</li>
</ul>

<p>We have also set out some more specific questions to help guide respondents so that your submissions will be easy for you to structure and will add maximum value to our policy development and analysis. These are set out at high level here and in more detail in the call for evidence questions below.</p>

<p>Submissions may focus on any individual question or cover them all.</p>

<h3>The costs to business incurred as a result of <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Changes in cost to business (either negative or positive) caused by the implementation of <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> and the ongoing development and compliance costs associated with this.</p>

<h3>Future business planning</h3>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business’ planning assumptions within the private market for COVID-19 tests, considering the uncertain situation the virus has presented</li>
  <li>the impact of external variables, including new technologies, changing epidemiological patterns and government policy on free asymptomatic testing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding the market</h3>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the life cycle of a COVID-19 detection test product</li>
  <li>views on the UK and global COVID-19 diagnostics market and economy</li>
  <li>views on the public perception of testing and expected uptake of testing services and devices</li>
  <li>potential impacts upon supply chains</li>
  <li>size and volume of COVID-19 tests on the market</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who can respond</h3>

<p>We welcome all evidence and analysis any stakeholder can provide on these broad topics.</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in responses from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufacturers of COVID-19 or other diagnostic tests</li>
  <li>distributors of COVID-19 or other diagnostic tests</li>
  <li>industry bodies</li>
  <li>academics and experts in the diagnostics industry</li>
  <li>think tanks and other research groups with relevant insight</li>
  <li>any others with evidence of potential impacts</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not publish any identifiable or commercially sensitive data unless you indicate in your response that you are happy to be referred to. We invite you to submit a response to the questions outlined below. You do not have to answer all questions, but the more information provided supports our policymaking and evaluation.</p>

<p>The call for evidence will run for 6 weeks, ending on 18 October 2022.</p>

<h3>How to respond</h3>

<p>We invite you to submit written responses via email. Fill in your responses to the questions and email <a class="govuk-link" href="CTDA.policy@ukhsa.gov.uk"><abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr>.policy@ukhsa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Read the background on the policy and legislation in this document and use the questions here only for reference. This is not an online form.</p>

<h2>Background on the policy and legislation</h2>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>On 28 July 2021, it became a legal requirement to seek UK government validation for antigen and molecular COVID-19 detection tests intended for sale on the UK market.</p>

<p>The Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (made under the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021) ensure that COVID-19 detection test products available for purchase on the UK market meet a minimum performance standard and consumers can have confidence in the performance of the tests they purchase.</p>

<p>Those tests that do not pass the validation assessment and meet a minimum performance threshold cannot be legally placed on the market and put into service or supply in the UK. The government publishes a register of tests that have passed validation to make it easy for consumers to make informed choices about the tests they purchase.</p>

<h3>Desktop review</h3>

<p>The desktop review is intended to prevent products that are below the minimum standards from progressing to the market as set out in the Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>The desktop review is an assessment of the evidence a manufacturer or distributor submits to support the performance of their product.</p>

<p>Applicants are required to submit information related to the following areas for basic checks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufacturer and product information</li>
  <li>regulatory status</li>
  <li>product performance</li>
  <li>biosafety</li>
  <li>supplementary documents (for example, current versions of the instructions for use, biosafety documents, evidence of performance characteristic)</li>
</ul>

<p>The desktop review assessment is then completed in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A scientific adviser reviews evidence provided by the applicant.</li>
  <li>The Desktop Review Assurance Group assesses this review and makes a recommendation.</li>
  <li>The Regulatory Approvals Committee then considers it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read more detailed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-test-approval-how-to-apply">guidance on the process of applying for desktop review</a>.</p>

<h2>Call for evidence questions</h2>

<p>Below are several detailed questions to help guide your responses and highlight the evidence we are most interested in receiving.</p>

<p>The answers to these questions will more closely align with our analytical needs and the specific policy issues where we want to build our underlying understanding.</p>

<p>You do not need to answer all questions, but please answer questions which are relevant to you as fully as possible.</p>

<p>Any commercially sensitive data you use to support your responses will only be used for the purposes of understanding your experiences of <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> and help us to effectively review this policy area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Impacts on business of <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>We invite manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers of COVID-19 tests to respond to the questions within this section. If you are not directly involved and are instead providing an estimate from an expert or academic perspective, please indicate this in your answer.</p>

<p>It is important that we understand as much as possible about the impact the legislation introducing mandatory validation for COVID-19 detection tests has had on cost or benefit to business so we can build upon its benefits while addressing the challenges it has raised.</p>

<h4>1 (A) Profits</h4>

<p>We want to collect detailed evidence of the gross profit margins over time of those involved in the supply of COVID-19 tests.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Please outline supported by evidence any changes in gross profit margins per device since July 2021, or since your application(s) for your test device(s) was submitted.

    <p>Please explain what elements you are including in the cost of sales (for example, fixed costs, research and development spending, branding).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>1 (B) Costs</h4>

<p>We want to collect detailed evidence of the costs involved in complying with the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> process and in supplying COVID-19 tests.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please outline, supported by evidence, the total costs of applying for the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> process. Please show both the itemised cost and staff hours spent. Please identify the number of applications you have made and the outcome of each. Please include in your answer what activities you are including in the costs.</li>
  <li>What is the average per unit production cost for COVID-19 tests?</li>
  <li>What is the investment that companies make in meeting new regulations on average?</li>
</ol>

<h4>1 (C) Investment</h4>

<p>We are interested in finding out how much it costs manufacturers to make improvements to their products, how often they revise tests and the associated costs in doing so.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can you estimate how much it would cost, on average, to modify a COVID-19 detection test? Please support your answer with evidence.</li>
  <li>Who would typically bear the cost of a reinvestment (for example, manufacturers in reduced profits or through cost cutting, equity holders in reduced dividends or further investment, or customers in prices)?</li>
  <li>How much would you estimate that it costs to bring a new product to market? Please outline:<br>
a. financial cost<br>
b. amount of time taken to bring a product to market<br>
</li>
  <li>What are your investment plans for COVID-19 diagnostic devices?</li>
</ol>

<h4>1 (D) Future business planning</h4>

<p>We invite manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers of COVID-19 tests to respond to the questions within this section.</p>

<p>Given the uncertain situation surrounding COVID-19, we are interested in understanding how businesses in the market for private COVID-19 testing devices and services are currently planning for the future.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please set out your future business planning assumptions; what opportunities, dependencies or risks you may have identified and what horizon period you are planning.</li>
  <li>How is the uncertainty of future pandemics impacting your business planning decisions?</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, external variables such as the potential for the emergence of new variants (or, if you are not a business, how do you predict these will impact these decisions?)</p>

<h4>1 (E) Product life cycle</h4>

<p>We are interested in your assessment of your products’ life cycles to gauge how often businesses must redevelop or update products to meet changing requirements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the average life cycle for your product or products or a COVID-19 diagnostic device?</li>
</ol>

<h4>1 (F) COVID-19 epidemiology</h4>

<p>COVID-19 is still an active public health issue and, as a result, we are interested in your thoughts on COVID-19 epidemiology and how you expect this will affect your business and the wider COVID-19 diagnostics market.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do you expect new variants to impact the UK COVID-19 diagnostic market over the next 12 months?</li>
  <li>What planning to replace or alter existing diagnostics devices do you conduct or think is appropriate for a manufacturer to conduct to ensure diagnostics remain effective at detecting new variants?</li>
  <li>Are you expecting to withdraw any tests from the market due to new variants?</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Analysis of the wider market</h3>

<p>In this section, we are seeking evidence regarding the wider market.</p>

<p>This will enable us to set the evidence of the experience of individual players in the broader context. It will also provide evidence of consumer experience. It will help us develop analysis of the likely shape of the market going forward and in turn analyse the best type of regulation to protect consumers going forward.</p>

<h4>2 (A) Interaction with universal free testing</h4>

<p>To meet the public health risk of the pandemic the UK provided free tests to all citizens on request.</p>

<p>We recognise that the universal testing offer (<abbr title="universal testing offer">UTO</abbr>) was a major intervention in the market and it distorted demand and supply of tests into the market. We are keen to understand the impact this had on consumers, retailers, suppliers, and manufacturers.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please describe how the <abbr title="universal testing offer">UTO</abbr> affected your business. What changes did the ending of the <abbr title="universal testing offer">UTO</abbr> have on your business?</li>
</ol>

<h4>2 (B) Understanding the market</h4>

<p>We invite stakeholders involved in the manufacture, distribution or retail of COVID-19 or other diagnostic tests, academics, and experts in the diagnostics industry to respond to the questions within this section.</p>

<p>We are interested in understanding more about the size, structure, and investment within the COVID-19 diagnostics market. Please support your answer with evidence.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The size, volume and value of the COVID-19 test market.</li>
  <li>What the supply chains look like and consist of.</li>
</ol>

<h4>2 (C) Market predictions</h4>

<p>To understand the mindset many companies operating in the UK diagnostic devices market will be acting under, we are interested in collecting economic predictions for the next 2 years. This will enable us to understand the thinking behind business decisions in this sector.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please set out, with evidence, the levels of growth you expect to see in the diagnostic devices markets in the UK and internationally, particularly for COVID-19 devices.</li>
  <li>Do you expect there to be similar levels of demand for testing in the private market if another pandemic (other than COVID-19) were to emerge?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Consumer behaviour</h4>

<p>The key issue in the early COVID-19 diagnostic devices market was the information asymmetry between sellers and consumers. The information provided was often not reflective of actual performance, confusing and not comparable with other products. Policy objectives included addressing this issue, protecting test users from poor quality tests and improving consumer confidence.</p>

<p>We are interested in your experiences of changing consumer behaviour and how <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> has informed and affected this. We would like to collect evidence regarding how consumers reacted to the pandemic in terms of purchasing COVID-19 diagnostic tests or testing services, and the extent to which the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> market intervention have impacted the consumer experience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you have procured or purchased tests for your organisation, did you use the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> register to inform your decision?</li>
  <li>Are there any improvements to the register you can suggest?</li>
  <li>What trends in consumer confidence in COVID-19 diagnostic devices have you observed?</li>
  <li>To what extent do you believe consumer behaviour regarding illness and diagnostics has changed due to the pandemic?</li>
  <li>Outside of medical diagnostics over the next 10 years, what activities, business areas or types of consumers will make regular use of COVID-19 testing?</li>
  <li>Are you working with other businesses and, if so, do these businesses want to test staff or customers (or both) in the absence of government requirements to do so?</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> International regulation and trade flows</h3>

<h4>3 (A) International regulatory environment</h4>

<p>We are interested in how the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> experience compared to other international jurisdictions. We are particularly interested in the impact of regulation and the application journey when compared to regulation in the US, Canada, Australia, and South Korea.[<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>]</p>

<ol>
  <li>What comparisons can you make between <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> and other regulatory regimes internationally? Please include views on levels of scientific rigour, fees and if they met in their countries the 5 objectives of <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr>. Please support your answer with evidence.</li>
</ol>

<p>The UK has long&nbsp;been seen as&nbsp;centre of excellence in high quality regulation&nbsp;which first and foremost protects consumers.&nbsp;This reputation has extended to many British goods sold internationally which have a reputation for high quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have received feedback that suggests in many parts of the world a test that has been seen to pass British regulatory standards will be seen as a trustworthy product and as&nbsp;such could act as an incentive to consumers particularly when coupled with the register information available online.</p>

<p>2. Would you see passing the UK’s validation for COVID-19 tests as a helpful marketing tool for selling in other international markets?</p>

<h4>3 (B) Trade flows</h4>

<p>Trade in diagnostic devices expanded massively over the pandemic.</p>

<p>The UK and other developed markets experienced large influxes of test devices particularly from manufacturers based in the far east. In addition, there were many new entrants to the market. Understanding these aspects and the impact that regulation had on these flows will be important to the evaluation.</p>

<p>We are interested in understanding more about the flow of COVID-19 test products in, out and around the UK.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where in the UK do you import to, and where do you import from?</li>
  <li>Where in the UK do you export from, and where do you export to?</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> application and administration</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> was rapidly set up within <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> as the body able to deliver a regulatory regime in the timings dictated by the pandemic. This required quickly standing up both an operational team and scientific advisors. In addition, a portal had to be designed and developed to receive applications.</p>

<p>It was important to ensure that the evidence received from companies was of a sufficiently high quality to make a decision.</p>

<p>Though we recognised the higher level of rigour <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> required compared to the EU regulations, a large number of companies in a scientific focused sector were unable to provide evidence of the quality required.</p>

<p>To support industry and manufacturers, rather than reject these applications, scientific advisors have provided extensive support to help these applications meet the evidential standards required. This has impacted the speed of applications through the process.</p>

<h4>4 (A) <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> application process</h4>

<p><abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> was designed as a scientifically rigorous yet efficient process. However, we recognise some elements on evidence standards were novel and challenging to some in industry to adapt to. We would like to hear about your experiences when applying through <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr>. This includes the evidence you prepared for the application and your communication with officials.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We invite stakeholders involved in submitting an application for COVID-19 tests to provide their experiences of the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> application process. Please provide as much detail as you can, including when you made an application and when you received your decision.</li>
</ol>

<h4>4 (B) <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> administration</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> has been administered since inception by the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) (and its predecessor NHS Test and Trace). It has used an online portal to receive applications and fees payment. A team of operational staff manages the applications through the system and supports the scientific advisors in their work.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please provide any other experience supported by evidence of the performance of the <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> scheme not covered by the previous section. Please include experience of complaints or re-review process in this answer.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> <abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> objectives</h3>

<p>During the pandemic there was high demand for COVID-19 diagnostics and there was an influx of new entrants to the market with a broad range of tests they were placing on the market.&nbsp;Existing&nbsp;EU regulation,&nbsp;including third-party conformity assessment, had failed&nbsp;to prevent&nbsp;poor quality COVID-19 tests entering the market.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;created a confusing&nbsp;marketplace&nbsp;for consumers and risked undermining attempts to&nbsp;combat the pandemic.&nbsp;<abbr title="Coronavirus test device approval">CTDA</abbr> was established with&nbsp;5&nbsp;overarching objectives&nbsp;to address this market failure&nbsp;and associated&nbsp;public health risk.</p>

<p>These objectives are&nbsp;set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce false negative and false positive test rates to help manage the spread of the disease, reduce incidences of unnecessary self-isolation and contact tracing</li>
  <li>correct the market failure, particularly the information asymmetry that prevented consumers from understanding or being able to compare test devices</li>
  <li>ensure all tests on the UK market were of the same standards as those used in the NHS, so that they can contribute to empowering people to manage their own health and combat the pandemic</li>
  <li>increased reliability of test products and easier comparability of their performance should drive increased take-up of testing by employers and institutions</li>
  <li>increased consumer confidence in test and subsequently, increased volumes of private tests being reported</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do you consider that these objectives remain the appropriate ones for validation of 
 COVID-19 test devices?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each of the above we would welcome your thoughts on whether you think these objectives have been met, how they have been met and whether you can propose any better or less onerous ways of achieving them. Please support your answers with evidence.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
