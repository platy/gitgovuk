<h2>Personal data we are collecting</h2>

<p>We have asked respondents to the consultation to voluntarily provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>capacity in which they are responding to this consultation exercise (for example, member of the public)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they have previously served within the fire service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>company name/organisation (if applicable)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they are a representative of a group, the name of the group and a summary of the people or organisations that they represent</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Taken together, these data may enable a respondent to be identified. In addition, the way in which a person responds to this consultation will also impact the data we collect on them. If someone responds via email, we will have collected their email address.</p>

<p>If respondents provide the information we request, we will use this to understand if there are significant differences between types of respondents with regard to responses to the consultation questions. We may illustrate findings through quotes provided to the consultation. We will ensure these are anonymised and do not include any personally identifiable information, unless an organisation tells us they are content for their response to be made public.</p>

<p>Your opinions are also personal data. We have requested that all responses to the free text questions remove all personally identifiable information such as names, dates and locations. However, some respondents may still provide information which could identify them.</p>

<h2>How and why the Home Office uses your information</h2>

<p>The Home Office collects, processes and shares personal information to enable it to carry out its statutory, and other, functions.</p>

<p>The Home Office is only allowed to process your data where there is a lawful basis for doing so.</p>

<p>The Home Office may share your information with other organisations in the course of carrying out our functions, or to enable others to perform theirs.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Home Office is undertaking a consultation on Public Service Pensions: Firefighters’ Pensions (Amendment) Regulations 2022, to enact the first phase of the remedy to the McCloud / Sargeant cases.</p>

<p>The first phase of the remedy is to make changes to the scheme regulations, in line with the Public Service Pensions &amp; Judicial Offices Bill, which will close the legacy pension schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022 and ensure all members who remain in service from 1 April 2022 are members of the reformed scheme (“the 2015 Scheme”).</p>
</div>

<h2>Questions for consultation</h2>

<p><b>Question 1</b>:  As required by the PSPJO, the draft regulations seek to ensure that the legacy schemes are closed to future accrual from 31 March 2022 and that all members are in the 2015 Scheme in respect of any pensionable service from 1 April 2022. Are the draft regulations sufficient to meet this aim? Do you think there are any changes or additions required to the draft regulations to achieve the stated policy aims?</p>

<p><b>Question 2</b>: The government is proposing that the regulations will be drafted to make additional provision for ill-health retirements that straddle the transfer date. This provision would ensure that a protected member who applies for ill-health retirement before 31 March 2022, and which is determined in their favour after that date, is treated no less favourably than if the application had been determined on that date. Do you have any views on the proposals regarding ill-health retirement cases that straddle 1 April 2022?  In particular, do you have any views on how the “underpin” should work or be provided for in the draft regulations?</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b>: The regulations will need to ensure that provisions which allow arrangements for purchasing service in the legacy schemes by periodical contributions, entered into before 1 April 2022, can continue on and after that date  and that additional benefit purchasing in the legacy schemes ceases on 31 March 2022. In your view, would existing provisions in the relevant reformed scheme regulations achieve these aims? Alternatively, would additional provisions be needed to achieve this outcome?</p>

<p><b>Question 4</b>: We are interested in understanding whether the scheme regulation amendments will have an impact on people with protected characteristics, beyond those equality considerations undertaken and set out in the EQIA undertaken alongside the consultation and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/42336/documents/588" rel="external">PSPJO</a>. Protected characteristics are: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Do you think that the draft regulations and policy intent as set out above will have any positive or negative impacts on people with protected characteristics, beyond those already considered? If so, which and why/why not?</p>

<p><b>Question 5</b>: Are there any other areas which you think should be addressed in these regulations to ensure all members are moved to the relevant reformed scheme from 1 April 2022, and that the differential treatment, as identified by the Court of Appeal, is ended?</p>

<p>In this case, the legal basis for the Home Office processing personal data is set out in Article 6(1)(c) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). Article 6(1)(c) permits the Home Office to process personal data where this is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which it is subject.</p>

<p>We will examine and analyse responses sent by respondents to the consultation. This will involve identifying issues and themes in responses and coding them to understand which of these are significant across the responses. We will publish high-level analysis, including breakdowns by the data we collect and the organisations who have responded (if they agree for their response to be made public and associated with the organisation), in the government response to this consultation. This will help us and those reading the government response understand how views differ across different groups.</p>

<p>More information about the ways in which the Home Office may use your personal information, including the purposes for which we use it, the legal basis, and who your information may be shared with can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a>.</p>

<h2>What we will not do</h2>

<p>We will not publish email addresses, or any personal information inadvertently provided in the free text responses.</p>

<p>Data obtained in relation to the consultation via post or email will not be shared with other organisations or sent overseas.</p>

<p>Your personal data will not be used for any automated decision making.</p>

<h2>Storing your information</h2>

<p>Personal information obtained via email will be held on a secure government IT system for the purpose for which it is being processed and in line with departmental policy. More details of this policy can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a>.</p>

<p>Any personal information that may be obtained via post will be securely stored in a government building, in line with Home Office Security and Retention Policy.</p>

<h2>Retention of personal data</h2>

<p>We will not keep personal data longer than is necessary for the purpose for which they are being processed. Our need to retain the data will be reviewed and maintained in accordance with Home Office data retention policies. Any deletion of data will take place in accordance with Home Office data retention policies.</p>
