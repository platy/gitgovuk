<p>A response to this consultation exercise will be published by the Home Office on gov.uk.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Executive summary</h2>

<p>1.1. In April 2015 the government introduced reformed public service pension schemes. 
The changes followed a fundamental structural review by the Independent Public 
Service Pension Commission, chaired by Lord Hutton of Furness. As part of these 
changes protection was provided to those members who were close to retirement, 
meaning that they would be allowed to remain in their legacy scheme or gradually 
transition to the relevant reformed public service pension scheme. For the 
firefighters’ pension scheme this applied to those within fourteen years of their 
normal pension age. This policy was referred to as transitional protection.</p>

<p>1.2. In December 2018, the Court of Appeal found this transitional protection to be 
discriminatory against younger members in the judicial and firefighters’ pension 
schemes, as transitional protection was only offered to older scheme members. The 
courts required that this unlawful discrimination be remedied by the government. 
The government accepted that this applied across all of the public sector pension 
schemes.</p>

<p>1.3. In order to remedy the discrimination, HM Treasury held an open consultation to 
consider the potential options to remove the discrimination. Following the close of 
the consultation in October 2020, it was announced in February 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
that affected members and fully protected members will receive at the point they retire a choice 
of which pension benefits they would prefer to receive in respect of any remediable 
service rendered between 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2022. This choice is whether 
the benefits should be modelled on the relevant legacy scheme or reformed 
scheme. This is known as the Deferred Choice Underpin, or “DCU”, and the 
retrospective remedy. Where members are already receiving pensions, they will be 
given a choice as soon as practicable. In addition, from 1 April 2022, all those who 
continue in service will do so as members of the reformed schemes, regardless of 
age, meaning all members will be treated equally in terms of which pension scheme 
they are a member. This is known as the prospective remedy.</p>

<p>1.4. The Public Service Pensions &amp; Judicial Offices Bill (PSPJO)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> was introduced to 
Parliament in July 2021. The Home Office as the Responsible Authority for the 
firefighters’ pension scheme is now considering how best to implement the scheme 
level changes that will be required when the relevant provisions in the PSPJO are enacted and come into force. This relates to both “prospective remedy”, ensuring all  future accrual from 1 April 2022 is in the reformed scheme, and “retrospective remedy”, enacting the Deferred Choice Underpin.</p>

<p>1.5. This consultation will address those elements of the prospective remedy, including 
moving all members to the reformed scheme (“the 2015 scheme”) from 1 April 2022 
and closing the legacy schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022. This will 
mean that all members are treated equally in respect of any pensionable service 
rendered after 31 March 2022. There will be an additional consultation in due 
course on the Deferred Choice Underpin, to address those elements of the remedy 
that will be retrospective in effect (i.e. relating to the remedy period, 1 April 2015 to 
31 March 2022).</p>

<p>1.6. The PSPJO, and the secondary legislation to be made under it, covering both 
“prospective” and “retrospective” phases of the remedy, remove the transitional 
protection that the Courts found to be discriminatory based on age; all eligible 
members, irrespective of age and proximity to NPA, will have accrued benefits in 
the legacy schemes for the remedy period (1 April 2015 - 31 March 2022).</p>

<p>This consultation will be open for views from Monday 8 November 2021 to Sunday 2 
January 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Prospective changes to remove age discrimination</h2>

<p>2.1. In April 2015 public service pension schemes were reformed; the cost of the legacy 
schemes had significantly increased over the previous decades, with most of those 
costs falling to the taxpayer. To protect against unsustainable increases in costs, 
new schemes were introduced with career average revalued earnings (CARE) 
design and increased Normal Pension Ages (NPA), alongside the introduction of a 
cost control mechanism. They were also progressive, providing greater benefits to 
some lower paid workers. These are the “2015” or “reformed” schemes.</p>

<p>2.2. As part of the 2015 reforms, members of the legacy schemes (i.e. those defined 
benefit pension schemes that had been introduced prior to 1 April 2015 for 
firefighters), who were aged within 10 years of their Normal Pension Age (NPA) on 
31 March 2012, were “fully protected” and allowed to remain in their legacy scheme. 
Members who, on 31 March 2012, were aged within 10 to 14 years of their NPA 
were allowed to remain in their legacy scheme for a period on a taper basis. 
Together, these protections (“full” and “taper”) were referred to as transitional 
protection.</p>

<p>2.3. In December 2018 the Court of Appeal found that transitional protection unlawfully 
discriminated against younger members of the judicial and firefighters’ pension 
schemes in particular, as it was only offered to older scheme members. The courts 
required that this unlawful discrimination be remedied by the government. It is 
important to note that the transitional protection element of the 2015 reforms was 
found to be discriminatory, not the reformed scheme itself.</p>

<p>2.4. In July 2019 the government confirmed that it accepted the Court’s judgment had 
implications for the other public service schemes that had similar transitional 
arrangements.</p>

<p>2.5. In July 2021 the PSPJO was introduced to Parliament, which, when enacted, will 
provide that all firefighters who continue in service from 1 April 2022 onwards must 
do so as members of the reformed scheme. Legacy schemes (i.e. the Firefighters’ 
Pension Scheme 1992 and Firefighters’ Pension Scheme 2006) will be closed in 
relation to service after 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>2.6. The secondary legislation to be consulted on here will allow provisions for the 
prospective remedy changes: the move of all members to the reformed scheme 
from 1 April 2022 and the closure of the legacy schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022 (the “Prospective Remedy”). This ensures that from 1 April 2022 all active members of the firefighters’ pension scheme will accrue benefits in the same scheme.</p>

<p>2.7. There will be an additional consultation on retrospective remedy, enacting the 
Deferred Choice Underpin, in due course, ahead of coming into force by 1 October 
2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Proposals to be consulted on:</h2>

<p>3.1. This consultation is on the amendments required to implement the Prospective 
Remedy, including moving all active members to the reformed scheme and making 
consequential changes to scheme regulations in line with the PSPJO.</p>

<p>3.2. A draft set of regulations to ensure all members accrue benefits in the reformed
scheme from 1 April 2022 is attached to this consultation.</p>

<p>3.3. There are two areas where we are considering whether further amendments to the 
regulations may be needed, beyond those in the attached draft. The policy intent on 
those areas is set out below. When responding to this consultation, we ask you to 
presume that the draft regulations will reflect the policy intent as described.</p>

<h3>Policy intent</h3>

<p>3.4. Legacy scheme purchasing of additional benefits. To ensure that those provisions 
which allow arrangements for purchasing service in the legacy schemes by means 
of periodical contributions can continue after 31 March 2022 and that no new legacy 
scheme arrangements can be entered into after 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>3.4.i. In both firefighters’ legacy pension schemes, it is possible for members to 
purchase additional pensionable service, where they meet certain criteria.
They do this by agreement with the scheme manager, and pay for it either as 
a lump sum or by way of periodical contributions over a period of years, until 
a set age (typically NPA).</p>

<p>3.4.ii. All such existing agreements will remain in force after 31 March 2022. This is 
because they do not involve continuing to accrue legacy scheme benefits in 
relation to service after the closing date; rather, the scheme members 
concerned are paying in instalments for a previously agreed enhancement to 
their pre-transfer service. These arrangements are therefore unaffected by 
the PSPJO or by our draft regulations. It should be noted that members will 
only be permitted to “complete” existing arrangements entered into before 1 
April 2022, subject to meeting any other relevant criteria (such as remaining 
in active service). Members will not be allowed to enter into arrangements to 
purchase additional service in the legacy schemes on or after 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>3.4.iii In order to give effect to the policy that accrual in the legacy schemes ceases 
on 31 March 2022, we are considering what provisions might be needed to 
ensure that no new arrangements can be entered into after 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>3.4.iv. We welcome views on whether scheme regulations would already achieve 
this without amendment.</p>

<p>3.5. Ill-health retirement (IHR) To ensure that a protected member who applies for IHR 
before 31 March 2022 where the application is determined in their favour after that 
date is treated no less favourably than if the application had been determined on 
that date.</p>

<p>3.5.i. Members who move to the reformed schemes and subsequently become 
subject to ill-health retirement will be assessed, and receive ill-health 
benefits, in accordance with the ‘one pot’ ill-health arrangements under the 
reformed scheme provisions – this means that cases will become subject to 
different qualifying criteria than under the legacy scheme rules.</p>

<p>3.5.ii. There will be cases that will be in the process of being considered for ill-health retirement on the date that all members will begin to accrue benefits in 
the reformed scheme - i.e. the ill-health process will begin on or before 31 
March 2022 and will not conclude until 1 April 2022 or later.</p>

<p>3.5.iii. The final approach to achieving the policy intent is still under development so 
our draft regulations do not contain any provision on ill-health retirements. 
We will use powers provided by PSPJO to amend scheme regulations in this 
area, in line with the policy intent set out in this document</p>

<p>3.5.iv. Subject to the outcome of this consultation, we will therefore use powers
under PSPJO to make regulations protecting the position of ill health retirees 
whose cases are pending on 31 March next year, and in particular to ensure 
they are no worse off as a result of a decision being made after that date.</p>

<p>3.5.v. For any ill-health cases that straddle 1 April 2022, the intended policy is the 
introduction of an “ill-health retirement underpin”. This will mean that such 
members receive a 2015 Scheme ill-health pension calculated at the date 
they actually retire; but that if a legacy scheme ill-health pension calculated 
as at 31 March 2022 would have been higher, the 2015 Scheme pension 
must be increased by the difference between the two.</p>

<p>3.5.vi. The “underpin” will effectively guarantee the member an ill-health pension 
that is at least as much as the they would receive had they been ill-health 
retired under the terms of their legacy scheme on 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>3.5.vii.The proposed ill-health underpin will work as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3.5.vii.(i). The member moves to the 2015 Scheme on 1 April 2022 and remains in the scheme until the date of ill-health retirement</li>
  <li>3.5.vii.(ii). The one-pot ill-health pension arrangement applies in the same way as it does to any other member who moves to the 2015 Scheme before their ill-health process starts</li>
  <li>3.5.vii.(iii). A notional ill-health pension is calculated in accordance with the member’s legacy scheme provisions on the basis that they had been ill-health retired on 31 March 2022</li>
  <li>3.5.vii.(iv). Ill-health pension (calculated under the one pot arrangement) will be paid from the 2015 Scheme</li>
  <li>3.5.vii.(v). Where the notional legacy scheme ill-health pension provides a greater ill-health pension entitlement, the difference between both calculations will be paid to the member as a pension enhancement from the 2015 Scheme</li>
  <li>3.5.vii.(vi). Survivor benefits will be paid in accordance with the 2015 Scheme regulations</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Questions for consultation</h2>

<p><b>Question 1:</b> As required by the PSPJO, the draft regulations seek to ensure that the 
legacy schemes are closed to future accrual from 31 March 2022 and that all members are 
in the 2015 Scheme in respect of any pensionable service from 1 April 2022. Are the draft 
regulations sufficient to meet this aim? Do you think there are any changes or additions 
required to the draft regulations to achieve the stated policy aims?</p>

<p><b>Question 2:</b> The government is proposing that the regulations will be drafted to make 
additional provision for ill-health retirements that straddle the transfer date. This provision 
would ensure that a protected member who applies for ill-health retirement before 31 
March 2022, and which is determined in their favour after that date, is treated no less 
favourably than if the application had been determined on that date. Do you have any 
views on the proposals regarding ill-health retirement cases that straddle 1 April 2022? In 
particular, do you have any views on how the “underpin” should work or be provided for in 
the draft regulations?</p>

<p><b>Question 3:</b> The regulations will need to ensure that provisions which allow arrangements 
for purchasing service in the legacy schemes by periodical contributions, entered into 
before 1 April 2022, can continue on and after that date and that additional benefit 
purchasing in the legacy schemes ceases on 31 March 2022. In your view, would existing 
provisions in the relevant reformed scheme regulations achieve these aims? Alternatively, 
would additional provisions be needed to achieve this outcome?</p>

<p><b>Question 4:</b> We are interested in understanding whether the scheme regulation 
amendments will have an impact on people with protected characteristics, beyond those 
equality considerations undertaken and set out in the EIA undertaken alongside the 
consultation and PSPJO<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Protected characteristics are: age, disability, gender 
reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and 
belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Do you think that the draft regulations and policy intent 
as set out above will have any positive or negative impacts on people with protected 
characteristics, beyond those already considered? If so, which and why/why not?</p>

<p><b>Question 5:</b> Are there any other areas which you think should be addressed in these 
regulations to ensure all members are moved to the relevant reformed scheme from 1 April 
2022, and that the differential treatment, as identified by the Court of Appeal, is ended?</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in this consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Conclusion and next steps</h2>

<p>6.1. Implementation is subject to the passage of the PSPJO. We would expect to lay 
regulations, subject to this consultation, in early March, to come into force on 1 April 
2022.</p>

<p>6.2. All scheme members still accruing benefits in a legacy pension scheme will be 
automatically moved across to the reformed scheme on 1 April 2022.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Draft Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) for Firefighters’ Pension Scheme Regulations Prospective Amendments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Name and outline of policy proposal, guidance or operational activity</h3>

<p>The firefighters’ pension scheme (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2022. 
Consultation on firefighters’ pension scheme regulation changes to enact the first phase 
(“prospective”) of the remedy to the McCloud / Sargeant cases.</p>

<p>The first phase of the remedy is to make changes to the scheme regulations, in line with 
the Public Service Pensions &amp; Judicial Offices Bill, which will close the legacy pension 
schemes to future accrual from 31 March 2022 and ensure all members who remain in 
service from 1 April 2022 do so as members of the reformed scheme (“the 2015 
Scheme”). This will ensure future equal treatment going forwards.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>This EIA is a live document, published here in draft. It reflects our careful considering of a 
range of data and evidence and provides a proportionate response on some of the key 
considerations made at this stage. This EIA will be kept under review and updated in 
future to reflect further considerations, including in relation to indirect discrimination. 
We welcome feedback on this EIA, to support its development, as we move to amend the 
pension scheme regulations to enact the first phase of the remedy to make prospective 
changes to the scheme regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Summary of the evidence considered in demonstrating due regard to the Public-Sector Equality Duty.</h3>

<p>We have used statistical data on the fire and rescue workforce and on pensions collected 
by the Home Office and pension scheme valuation data from the Government Actuary 
Department, published here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actuarial-valuation-of-the-firefighters-schemes-2016">Actuarial valuation of the firefighters’ schemes 2016</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Purpose</h3>

<p>The Public Sector Equality Duty is set out in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 and 
requires public authorities, in the exercise of their functions, to have due regard to the 
need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the 2010 Act,</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not, and</li>
  <li>foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.</li>
</ul>

<p>This involves having due regard to the need to:</p>

<p>(a) remove or minimise disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics, and</p>

<p>(b) take steps to meet the needs of people from protected groups where these are different from the needs of other people.</p>

<p>The equality duty covers the nine protected characteristics: age, disability, gender 
reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or 
belief, sex (gender) and sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/42336/documents/588" rel="external">HM Treasury has conducted an equality impact assessment</a>, which considers the impact 
of the overarching policy and the proposed Bill powers and requirements. As set out in that 
assessment, in particular paragraph 1.8, that assessment “does not cover secondary 
legislation made using powers in this Bill. Separate analysis to consider the impact of 
changes to scheme regulations (beyond those covered and/or directed by the measures in 
the Bill) will be produced when the powers to do so are exercised”.</p>

<p>This assessment therefore focusses on the impact of the proposed changes to scheme 
rules necessary to deliver the Bill requirements, specifically in relation to the first phase of 
remedy (“prospective”). This closes the 1992 and 2006 firefighters’ pension schemes to 
future accrual on 31 March 2022 and moves all members who continue in service to the 
2015 firefighters’ pension scheme, on 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The equality duty is an ongoing duty and we will continue to consider and amend this 
assessment until the final regulations enacting the prospective remedy are made. 
A separate assessment will be carried out in due course that focusses on the second 
phase of remedy (“retrospective”) i.e. ensuring that eligible members have a choice of the 
benefits they wish to take for the “remedy period” of April 2015 to 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>To note, data used in this assessment is predominantly from the actuarial valuation as at 
31 March 2016. More recent data is not currently available, but we will update the data if 
and where available in formulating the final assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Consideration of the duty</h3>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<h5>Members in Scope</h5>

<p>Firefighters’ Pension Scheme members in scope are those members who started 
pensionable public service on or before 31 March 2012, had legacy scheme membership 
during the remedy period and remain an active member of the legacy Firefighters’ Pension 
Scheme on 31 March 2022. The unlawful age discrimination was between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those members who received full protection because they were ten years or less from their normal pension age at 1 April 2012,</li>
  <li>those members who received taper transitional protection because they were between ten and fourteen years from their normal pension age at 1 April 2012, and</li>
  <li>those members who did not receive transitional protection because they more than fourteen years from their normal pension age at 1 April 2012.</li>
</ul>

<p>Phase 1 of the remedy covers Firefighters’ Pension Scheme members who received full 
transitional protection and applies equally to all these members.</p>

<h5>Members out of Scope</h5>

<p>Firefighters’ Pension Scheme members out of scope are those members who first joined 
any public service pension scheme after 31 March 2012. These members were ineligible 
for transitional protection regardless of their age, and therefore were not subject to the age 
discrimination identified by the Court of Appeal.</p>

<h4>Age</h4>

<p>The transitional protection implemented as part of the reforms to public service pension 
schemes- the reforms based on the recommendations of Lord Hutton - was found by the 
Court of Appeal to be directly age discriminatory as eligibility for such protection was 
based on age criteria.</p>

<p>The table below shows the number of fully protected members in the 1992 Scheme and 
the 2006 Scheme, as at 31 March 2016.</p>

<p>The proposed changes to Firefighters’ Pension Scheme Regulations will be applied to all 
members regardless of age. The exceptions that allowed certain members who were 
closer to retirement age to remain in the legacy scheme after 31 March 2015 under the 
transitional protection arrangement will apply only in respect of service up to 31 March 
2022. From 1 April 2022, all active members will be moved to the 2015 Firefighters’ 
Pension Scheme and from that point will build future pension rights on the same basis
irrespective of age.</p>

<p>The effects of such transitional protection will be addressed by the second phase of the 
remedy. All eligible members will be offered a choice over the set of benefits (legacy 
scheme or new scheme) they wish to receive for any pensionable service during the 
period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022. This is the remedy period in respect of which 
provisions in the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme and similar provisions in other public 
service pension schemes was found to be discriminatory by the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>As explored in sections 3.39-3.42 of the EIA undertaken for the PSPJO, we are aware of 
an issue relating to the different age at which a member can take benefits in the legacy 
and reformed schemes. We continue to undertake further analysis but at present remain of 
the view that the limited impacts on these protected groups are justified in the context of 
the aim of removing earlier discrimination in a manner that respects the rationale for 
maintaining any transitional protection up to 31 March 2022 and moving all members to a 
reformed scheme from 1 April 2022.</p>

<h4>Sex</h4>

<p>The Equalities Act 2010 lists ‘sex’ as a protected characteristic. Data for the Firefighters’ 
Pension Scheme is also divided by sex. However, it is important to note that sex and 
gender are two different concepts. A person’s gender identity is not always the same as 
the sex assigned to them at birth, and some people may not identify as having a gender or 
as non-binary. Gender reassignment is also a protected characteristic under the Equality 
Act 2010.</p>

<p>The proposed changes will apply to all members regardless of sex and gender identity.</p>

<p>Closing the legacy scheme to future pension accrual applies to all legacy scheme 
members regardless of sex. From 1 April 2022 all Firefighters’ Pension Scheme members, 
who remain in pensionable service, will only be eligible to do so as a member of the 
reformed scheme. Moving from a final salary legacy scheme to a career average reformed 
scheme for future accrual flattens out the added benefit of late career pay progression for 
higher earners who are more likely to be male. However, in doing so the aim is to ensure 
equal treatment of all active members for future service.</p>

<p>Firefighters’ Pension Scheme actuarial valuation data at 31 March 2016 shows that 95.4% 
of the active membership are male and 4.6% of the membership are female. This is 
broadly similar to data in the Home Office Fire and rescue authorities: operational statistics 
bulletin for England 2015 to 2016 statistical release, which shows that 5.0% of firefighters 
at 31 March 2016 (including those who are not members of the Firefighters Pension 
Scheme) were female. This was 7.5% as at 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>Moving from a final salary legacy scheme to a career average reformed scheme for future 
accrual from 1 April 2022 may also impact members who take career breaks or work part-time and data tells us that a higher proportion of women do so than men. A change to the 
overall picture of benefits may impact a member’s previous assumptions about when and 
how they would take their pension. However, changes to pension arrangements by their 
nature impact differently on those who join or leave the fire service at different times and 
the proposed changes will apply to all members regardless of sex. We therefore remain of 
the view that the limited impacts on women are justified and are in the context that, from 1 
April 2022, all active members will be in the career average reformed scheme and from 
that point will accrue future pension benefits on the same basis irrespective of sex.</p>

2006 Scheme, who are female and male, as at 31 March 2016.</p>

<h4>Ethnicity (Race)</h4>

<p>Available data on the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme membership only covers members’ 
age and sex. However, fire and rescue authority workforce data is available on Ethnicity. 
This is regarded as a reasonable proxy given the high percentage of firefighters who are 
pension scheme members. However, the workforce data on Ethnicity of firefighters does 
include those who are not members of the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme.</p>

<p>The table below shows the Ethnicity of firefighters who declared their ethnicity, using 
source data as at 31 March 2021, from the Fire and rescue workforce and pensions 
statistics: England, April 2020 to March 2021 statistical release.</p>

<p>We have considered the potential impact on members from different ethnic backgrounds 
and the proposed phase one amendments will apply to all members equally, regardless of 
their ethnicity.</p>

<h4>Marriage and Civil Partnership</h4>

<p>There is no available data on this group in relation to firefighters or Firefighters’ Pension 
Scheme membership. However, the Department has considered the potential impact of 
the proposals on members who have this protected characteristic as part of our analysis 
on sex.</p>

<h4>Disability, Religion and Belief, Gender Reassignment, Sexual Orientation, Pregnancy and Maternity</h4>

<p>Available data on people with these protected characteristics, both in the Firefighters’
Pension Scheme and the fire workforce, is limited. However, we have considered the 
potential equality impacts of the proposed changes for members who share these
protected characteristics and those who do not.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the limited evidence available, the Department does not 
envisage any unjustified differential impacts that the consequential amendments will cause 
for members by reference to these protected characteristics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Department has not identified additional benefits, costs or wider impacts flowing from 
the consequential Firefighters’ Pension Scheme Regulations amendments enacting phase one of the remedy, as these are consequential in nature and designed to deliver the Bill 
requirements, which have been assessed by HM Treasury.</p>

<p>The Department has considered the impact of the proposals in context of this duty. To 
reiterate, the equality duty is an ongoing duty and we will continue to consider and amend 
this assessment until the final regulation amendments for prospective remedy are laid. We 
invite respondents to help refine this analysis by contributing further perspectives or 
identifying where there might be equality impacts to consider. Please see question four of 
the consultation.</p>

<h3><span class="number">1992 Scheme </span></h3>

<p>The Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) as established by the 
Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992.</p>

<h3><span class="number">2006 Scheme </span></h3>

<p>The New Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) as established by 
the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) Order 2006.</p>

<h3><span class="number">2015 Scheme </span></h3>

<p>The Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) 2015 as established by 
the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) Regulations 2015.</p>

<h3>Active member</h3>

<p>A member of a firefighters’ pension scheme who is actively employed 
as a firefighter (i.e. they have not retired, resigned or otherwise ended 
the employment).</p>

<h3>Affected member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who has suffered age discrimination, i.e. anyone 
who was employed as a firefighter on both 1 April 2012 and 1 April 
2015, but was aged under 45, and thus too young to qualify for full 
transitional protection, on the former date. It includes taper protected 
members.</p>

<h3>Age discrimination</h3>

<p>Treating employees or any other group of people less favourably 
because of their age. Age discrimination is unlawful unless it can be 
shown to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>

<h3>Career average revalued earnings (CARE)</h3>

<p>A means of calculating pension entitlement based on a member’s 
average pensionable pay over the course of their employment, 
adjusted for inflation.</p>

<h3>Deferred choice underpin (DCU)</h3>

<p>The mechanism by which affected and fully protected members will 
decide whether their service during the remedy period should be 
treated as service in their legacy scheme or the 2015 Scheme. Such 
a choice will be made when the member retires or when their pension 
benefits otherwise first fall to be paid (e.g. if they die before they 
retire). We will establish that in further regulations which we will 
consult on next year. It is not covered by these draft regulations.</p>

<h3>Fully protected member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who was granted full transitional protection in 
2015, i.e. anyone who was employed as a firefighter on both 1 April 
2012 and 1 April 2015 and was aged 45 or older on the former date.</p>

<h3>Legacy scheme</h3>

<p>The scheme of which an affected member was a member immediately 
before 1 April 2015 – i.e. the 1992 Scheme or the 2006 Scheme.</p>

<h3>McCloud, Sargeant, or McCloud / Sargeant</h3>

<p>The court cases of McCloud (in relation to judges) and Sargeant (in 
relation to firefighters) which established that age-based transitional 
protection amounted to unlawful age discrimination.</p>

<h3>Normal pension age (NPA)</h3>

<p>The age at which an active member normally becomes entitled to 
receive their pension.</p>

<p>It is stipulated in scheme rules and can vary from one scheme to 
another. For instance, the 1992 Scheme has an NPA of 55 but the 
2006 and 2015 Schemes have an NPA of 60.</p>

<h3>Prospective remedy</h3>

<p>From 1 April 2022, all those who continue in service will do so as 
members of the reformed scheme, regardless of age, meaning all 
members will be treated equally in terms of which pension scheme 
they are a member.</p>

<h3>Remedy period</h3>

<p>The period to which the remedy for age discrimination will apply: 1 
April 2015 to 31 March 2022, inclusive.</p>

<h3>Retrospective remedy</h3>

<p>Affected members and fully protected members will receive at the 
point they retire a choice of which pension benefits that they would 
prefer to receive in respect of any remediable service rendered 
between 31 March 2015 and 1 April 2022. This choice is whether the 
benefits should be modelled on the relevant legacy scheme or 
reformed scheme. This is known as the Deferred Choice Underpin 
(DCU). Where members are already receiving pensions, they will be
given a choice as soon as practicable</p>

<h3>Retired member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who has retired and is receiving pension benefits.</p>

<h3>Survivor</h3>

<p>An individual entitled to survivor benefits – normally a spouse, partner 
or child who is entitled to receive scheme benefits after the member 
dies.</p>

<h3>Taper protected member</h3>

<p>A scheme member who was offered tapered transitional protection in 
2015, i.e. the right to join the 2015 Scheme on a phased basis. This 
applies to anyone who was employed as a firefighter on both 1 April 
2012 and 1 April 2015 and was aged between 41 and 44 on the 
former date. Taper protected members are also affected members.</p>

<h3>Transitional protection</h3>

<p>The right to remain as a member of a legacy scheme beyond 31 
March 2015</p>
