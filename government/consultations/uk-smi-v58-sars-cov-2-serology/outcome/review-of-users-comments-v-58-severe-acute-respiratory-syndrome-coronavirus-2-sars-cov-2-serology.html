<h2>Section 4. Background</h2>

<h3>Comment number&nbsp;2</h3>

<h4>Date received</h4>
<p>6 October 2021</p>

<h4>Laboratory or organisation name</h4>
<p>Institute of Biomedical Science</p>

<p>1. First paragraph:</p>

<p>“The serological differentiation between different viral targets such as nucleocapsid or spike antigen might help.”</p>

<p>The highlighted phrase is vague, is this sufficient justification for deployment? A more considered phrase may work better.</p>

<p>2. Second paragraph:</p>

<p>“A longitudinal study has reported that patients who recovered from mild COVID-19 infection developed <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>-specific <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> antibodies, neutralising plasma, and memory B and memory T cells that persisted for at least 3 months (8). While there is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (<abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>) an increase in evidence to suggest memory T cells develop post <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection correlates of immunity are not yet well defined (9)”.</p>

<p>The combination of wording and punctuation in the above sentences do not read well. The following changes are suggested: evidence to suggest that memory T cells develop post <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection, correlates of immunity are not yet well defined. or develop following <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection.</p>

<p>3. Third paragraph:</p>

<p>“Epidemiological and public health control measures by providing information of the level and length of the immune response following <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> viral infection. This information will be useful to determine reinfection and how the virus spreads across the country.”</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Institute of Biomedical Science">IBMS</abbr> is happy with the wording above however, given the high community transmission and repeat exposures plus vaccination, is not sure meaningful data will result. The <abbr title="Standards for microbiology investigations">SMI</abbr> panel may wish to review this based on timeframes for waning antibody levels.</p>

<p>In addition to the reasons given for <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> antibody testing (page 6, second paragraph), it is worth also noting that following the approval of Ronapreve for therapy of selected <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> positive, spike antibody negative in-patients, and prophylaxis of high-risk spike antibody negative patients (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cas.mhra.gov.uk/ViewandAcknowledgment/ViewAlert.aspx?AlertID=103175" rel="external">Central Alerting System</a>) this has become the main reason for <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> spike antibody testing.</p>

<p>1. There needs to be something to say that if recently vaccinated, that is, first dose less than 56 days ago as per the GOV.UK antibody interpretation document for <abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr>, not a cause for concern or that it may take up to 56 days to develop antibodies to S. A person may be N detected and S not but might have been vaccinated recently and thus no S yet. Again, with N not detected and S not detected but have been vaccinated 3 days ago. Link to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/antibody-testing-for-sars-cov-2-information-for-general-practitioners/antibody-testing-for-sars-cov-2-information-for-general-practitioners"><abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> interpretation document</a>. I guess we should try to send a consistent message as all same organisation.</p>

<p>2. N negative, S positive: Suggestive of response to spike targeted <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> vaccination if administered recently ‘Recently’ needs clarifying. Secondly, this seems to go against the GOV.UK interpretation for <abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr> which says: “a negative result after one dose of vaccination should not be cause for concern, particularly if vaccine was administered fewer than 56 days ago”.</p>

<p>1. N negative, S positive: it could either indicate false positive <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> or <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> generated against spike protein outlasting the <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> generated against nucleocapsid following natural infection I was glad to see them include subtleties of false positives, and the document mentions, in footnote a, the likelihood of false reactivity depends on local seroprevalence. However, I think this will cause confusion if the statement isn’t quantified. Suggest give example of false positive rate where local prevalence is 100/100K to guide interpretation.</p>

<p>2. N not tested, S positive “consistent with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection or vaccination at some time.” This doesn’t really fit with “Suggestive of response to spike targeted <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> vaccination if administered recently”. These need to be made consistent once the first bullet point is addressed.</p>

<p>1. Algorithm. I can see why you chose to squeeze it into one but it doesn’t work well, in fact, it would probably be best as just the table of result patterns. For example, you have chosen to start with ant-N but actually most sites will do anti-s first now it is required pre-antibody therapy.</p>

<p>2. Suggest mention indeterminate results are not included in the algorithm.</p>

<p>3. Footnote a) needs adjusting. The likelihood of false reactivity depends on lots of stuff, not just the local seroprevalence. If the test was truly 100% specific, the local prevalence wouldn’t matter at all.</p>

<p>1. Report comments: not internally consistent with respect to “suggestive of” or “consistent with”. “Consistent with” is better for antibody detection. I would simplify the report comments. Omit the “it is important to follow current guidelines on protection from <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>”. This type of advice is not put on any other report, for example, <abbr title="Varicella zoster">VZV</abbr> <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> negative (avoid primary infection), HCV antibody positive (avoid reinfection).</p>

<p>2. N pos, S pos - why mention possible subsequent spike <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> boost? It provides no help to the service user or the patient, and might even be misleading.</p>

<p>3. N neg, S pos- wordy, and what is “recent”? Could just report consistent with vaccine response, past infection, or false positive anti-spike <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are several national level initiatives about guidance on interpretation of serology that have already been gathered together and consolidated.</p>

<p>(a) Into the guidance that has been issued for <abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr> which was done through Chief Medical officer (<abbr title="Chief Medical Officer">CMO</abbr>) office, but with coordination with NHS E, Royal College of Pathologists (<abbr title="Royal College of Pathologists">RCPath</abbr>) and Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>). This is what people are referring to at present, though it may not be as detailed as necessary for complex patient groups.</p>

<p>(b) There was a general agreement with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> that a more detailed guidance might be needed, to be produced through NHS E, which there is a working group operating, and as it happens <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is deeply involved in that with meetings scheduled over the last few weeks. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> can give an update. This more detailed guidance is also intended to be consistent with what has already been issued, but also underpin testing programmes to support monoclonal antibodies (<abbr title="monoclonal antibodies">MABs</abbr>) and any other interventions.</p>

<p>(c) Anything that <abbr title="Standards for microbiology investigations">SMI</abbr> are doing on reporting of antibody test results should fit or be consistent within this landscape, as multiple divergent guidance documents from different organisations are not what is needed at the present time. Would also suggest that definitive interpretation is a bit tricky, given the state of understanding of COVID-19 serology profiles over time, so an <abbr title="Standards for microbiology investigations">SMI</abbr> in this area might be a little premature.</p>

<p>This document from the standards unit is highly duplicative of the existing guidance for <abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr> (issued by NHS Test and Trace) and of the more detailed guidance targeted at specialists, lab managers and doctors managing special groups currently being drafted by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> in consultation with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> (me, and therefore virology cell), <abbr title="Royal College of Pathologists">RCPath</abbr> and the operational leads for serology testing at NHS England (who are currently creating a pathway for non-responders to vaccine). This more detailed guidance is aiming to cover everything in the standards unit’s document and more. I am not sure what this additional guidance from the standards unit adds, particularly as there is little in the document about standardising the procedures used. I think the next step is to contact the standards unit to let them know about the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> guidance that is being written, and invite them to contribute to that.</p>

<p>1. Regarding COVID-19 testing <abbr title="Standards for microbiology investigations">UKSMI</abbr> from <abbr title="general practitioners">GPs</abbr>, Thanks! I’m struck that they mention false positives (without a specificity) but not false negatives (and no sensitivity) which are the major problem to my mind. Per our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antibody-tests-guidelines.html" rel="external">Centers for Disease Control guidelines</a>. A negative antibody test does not preclude previous infection. A proportion of persons who are infected with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> might not develop measurable antibodies, thereby limiting the sensitivity of any antibody test to detect previous infection in these individuals. In addition, measurable antibodies also might wane over time, and the extent to which seroreversion occurs could vary according to the antibody test used.</p>

<p>2. And the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/diagnostics/antibody-testing/" rel="external"><abbr title="Infectious Diseases Society of America">IDSA</abbr></a>: Due to the time it takes for antibodies to become detectable, serologic tests are not useful early in the course of illness for diagnosing COVID-19. In addition, most but not all patients with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection develop an antibody response, and so a negative serologic result does not exclude past infection. And the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764954" rel="external">Journal of the American Medical Association (<abbr title="Journal of the American Medical Association">JAMA</abbr>)</a> (older but still relevant).</p>

<p>Interesting to read through. Biobank sent me an Ab test after my first vaccination - negative - so wonder what this means! Generally the document is clear, useful, and well written; pathway diagram very good. Areas to improve:</p>

<p>1. My (personal) findings are also an occasional dilemma in <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> land so - guidance should consider how to interpret intermediate results such as this.</p>

<p>2. Graph of test results v time: this looks similar to one that was published early in the pandemic (updated for antibody tests?) but is based around a median incubation period of 7days. This is no longer felt to be true (due to quicker effect of the delta variant?). Could they also extend the timescale to show what happens to <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> over a longer period?</p>

<p>3. Could they also do a simpleton’s version of the explanation of -N and -S tests?</p>

<p>1. A necessary document. P6: “Therefore, at present, positive serological assays cannot be used to infer protective immunity against <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> or as a sole method for the diagnosis’”. That last bit is not because of the lack of knowledge of correlates of immunity, it is about test performance, so the “therefore” doesn’t apply.</p>

<p>2. I am not bothered, but passively acquired antibody is rarely mentioned in any serology <abbr title="Standards for microbiology investigations">SMI</abbr>, but now that almost all of the population are either N or S positive, it will be passively acquired.</p>

<p>1. “Antibody tests help to determine that an individual has been exposed to the virus immunologically regardless of symptom presentation.” Not always exposed to the virus, but instead vaccine component - which is one point of this <abbr title="Standards for microbiology investigations">SMI</abbr> (distinguishing natural infection from vaccine induced).</p>

<p>3.

<p>4. “Impact of variant strains on serology tests is not understood just yet, but likely to be limited in commercial test kits and assays which are looking for broad antibody response with diverse antibody repertoire.” Is this still true, surely we know something now? “Limited” is imprecise in meaning, how about “unlikely to be significant”?</p>

<p>Previous treatment with <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> neutralising monoclonal antibodies (currently Ronapreve or sotrovimab) will also result in positive spike antibody testing, which may last for many months (especially with sotrovimab).

<p>Footnote b) “…bottom 10% of the assays positive range” is not meaningful. The upper limit of our Abbott S1 <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> assay is 40,000, so the lower 10% of that would be 4,000. That would include over 70% of all the results we have reported since April 2021, which is probably not the intention of the guidance. It is also possible to extend the reportable range by dilution (because many samples test as &gt;40,000) which would result in an even higher 10% threshold.</p>

<p>1. In the interpretation comments, references to <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr> should be replaced by antibody as many commercial assays in use are total antibody assays.</p>

<p>2. In the interpretation comments, where antibody is detected there is a rider comment regarding immunoglobulin. Whilst accurate, this seems odd to include, as such would apply to all serological tests that detect <abbr title="Immunoglobulin G">IgG</abbr>, but we do not normally include such a comment. If the intent is specifically regarding <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> therapeutic <abbr title="neutralising monoclonal antibodies">nMABs</abbr> (neutralising monoclonal antibodies) (for example, Sotrovimab, Ronapreve), this should be explicitly stated.</p>

<p>3. In the interpretation comments, the references to government guidance seem redundant and, given web addresses change, would be hard to maintain. I recommend these be removed.</p>

<p>4. The interpretation comment for situation number 2 (anti-S detected, anti-N not detected) whilst plausible is likely to confuse. Why not have the same comment as scenario number 3? We do not yet have clear evidence that antibody to one marker persists any longer than another to my knowledge. This would be far simpler and not really any less accurate.</p>
