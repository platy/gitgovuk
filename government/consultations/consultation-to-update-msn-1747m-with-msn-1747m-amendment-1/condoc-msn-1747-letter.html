<p>Dear Consultee</p>

<h2>CONSULTATION ON AMENDMENT TO MERCHANT SHIPPING NOTICE 1747(M) ON THE CATEGORISATION OF EU WATERS IN RELATION TO THE MERCHANT SHIPPING (PASSENGER SHIPS ON DOMESTIC VOYAGES) REGULATIONS 2000</h2>

<p>This consultation seeks comments on a draft updated Merchant Shipping Notice (MSN) 1747(M) which designates waters which are considered by the UK to be Sea Areas C and D around the UK.</p>

<p>The original designation of Sea Areas (then referred to as “EU Sea Areas”) shown in MSN 1747(M) was carried out using the Metrological Office data available at the time. Since then, a Metrological Report was published in 2011 in which the data has been updated and shows sea state data in a more granular way. As a result of this, it may be possible to re-categorise areas of water based on new data. One specific area of water has been identified for review, but consultees are invited to suggested any others for which they consider a review is appropriate based on the Met Office Report.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is proposed to update the MSN with consequential amendments, the main ones of which is to revise definitions of Sea Areas C and D, brought about by amendments to Directive 2009/45/EC by Directive 2017/2108/EU which were implemented by the Merchant Shipping (Safety Standards for Passenger Ships on Domestic Voyages) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1222);</p>

<p>The consultation period will run for 5 weeks from 27 January to 3 March 2022.</p>

<p>The consultation documents accompany this consultation letter.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This MSN was originally published in October 2000 to fulfil an obligation in Directive 98/18/EC, the Domestic Passenger Ships Directive. that as, a member state, the UK must specify geographical areas of water adjacent to the UK which were considered to be EU Sea Areas C or D.</p>

<p>Subsequently this Directive was replaced by Directive 2009/45/EC and more recently the UK has left the EU, however, it is necessary to retain the Sea Area categories because UK legislation still refers to them.</p>

<h3>Changes to be reflected in the revised version of MSN 1747(M)</h3>

<h3>We would like to hear from you</h3>

<p>We would welcome your comments about the proposed MSN. We are particularly interested in hearing your comments on the following aspects of the draft MSN:</p>

<p>c)	any non-statutory advice with which you disagree;</p>

<p>d)	any content you believe is unclear;</p>
