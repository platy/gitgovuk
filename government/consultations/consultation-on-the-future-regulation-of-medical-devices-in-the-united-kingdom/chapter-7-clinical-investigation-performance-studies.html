<h3>Section 31 - Clinical evaluation (general medical devices)</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>31.1. The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK medical devices regulations) require that, prior to obtaining a UKCA marking and placing a device on the Great Britain market, manufacturers must ensure that the design and manufacture of a device does not compromise the clinical condition of patients and users.</p>

<p>31.2. To do this a manufacturer must systematically collect, analyse and assess the clinical data relevant to the medical device in order to verify the safety and performance of that device - this is known as a  clinical evaluation. Clinical data is safety and/or clinical performance information that is generated from the use of a medical device in humans. A number of data sources can be used, including data from an equivalent device, literature reviews and data obtained through the monitoring of medical devices once they are on the market.</p>

<p>31.3. However, sometimes there are gaps in the clinical data that cannot be addressed by other means. Where there is not sufficient pre-existing evidence to demonstrate that the device conforms with the relevant safety and performance requirements, the manufacturer should carry out a clinical investigation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>verify that under normal conditions of use the performance characteristics of the device are those intended by the manufacturer, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>determine any undesirable side-effects and to assess whether these are acceptable risks when weighed against the intended performance of the device.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>31.4. If such an investigation is necessary, the manufacturer must make an application to the MHRA before the investigation is due to begin. The clinical investigation may only then proceed provided no grounds for objection are raised by the MHRA within the statutory review time constraint. The MHRA will reach a decision, aided by a number of expert assessors.</p>

<p>31.5. The MHRA considers that it is best practice for clinical investigations to have a sponsor, who must take responsibility for the initiation, management and financing of the clinical investigation. The sponsor can be the manufacturer or another entity, such as a health institution.</p>

<p>31.6. We also consider it best practice for clinical investigations to have a principal clinical investigator, who is responsible for the conduct of a clinical investigation and takes responsibility for the health and safety of the subjects involved.</p>

<p>31.7. Sponsors and investigators are responsible for ensuring that the investigation is conducted in full accordance with the approved clinical investigation plan (CIP) and the requirements of the UK medical devices regulations. Deviations from the CIP must be reported to the MHRA and there must be adequate monitoring in place to ensure that the rights, safety and wellbeing of subjects are protected.</p>

<p>31.8. The clinical evaluation, including data collected through the clinical investigation, is assessed by an Approved Body, in cases where oversight from an Approved Body is required, during the conformity assessment process (see Chapter 6).</p>

<p>31.9. The UK medical devices regulations could include more detailed requirements for how a clinical evaluation must be conducted and documented by the medical device manufacturer. The objective of this would be to ensure that medical device manufacturers conduct effective clinical evaluations of their medical devices in a consistent and systematic way, taking into account all relevant clinical data, in order to demonstrate that a medical device is safe and performs as intended. This would help ensure that medical devices are not placed on the UK market unless there is sufficient evidence of their safety and performance.</p>

<h3>Possible Changes and Questions</h3>

<p>31.10. The MHRA has identified that, in line with the objectives outlined above, the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to provide additional detail on the content and scope of a clinical evaluation, as well as the processes for conducting and documenting a clinical evaluation. Specific proposals are outlined in this section. Please note that additional questions, covering transitional arrangements for clinical investigations, are set out in Chapter 15.</p>

<h4>Equivalent devices</h4>

<p>31.11. Currently, manufacturers can use the clinical data arising from investigations of a similar “equivalent” device as evidence that their own device is safe and performs as intended (due to the similarities between the devices). Manufacturers often claim equivalence on the basis that ‘part’ of a device is similar to another device. For example, a manufacturer may claim equivalence to a device that has the same function or dimensions even if it is made from different materials. This can result in ‘product creep’ where new devices on the market in practice become very different from their ‘equivalent’ devices. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could introduce stricter requirements for claiming equivalence to prevent this from occurring. Such requirements could include:</p>

<p>a. an equivalent medical device must be “entirely equivalent” to the manufacturer’s medical device (on a biological, physical, and clinical basis). This would mean that the manufacturer would not be able to claim equivalence to a part of that medical device; equivalence could only be claimed in relation to the whole device</p>

<p>b. where a manufacturer claims equivalence to a medical device which is not the manufacturer’s medical device (i.e. it has been marketed by another manufacturer) they would be required to:</p>

<p>i. have a contract in place with that manufacturer to allow them full access to the technical documentation for the medical device on an ongoing basis, and</p>

<p>ii. ensure that the clinical evaluation of the medical device they are claiming equivalence to meets the UK medical devices regulations and, where relevant, demonstrate this to their Approved Body, and</p>

<p>iii. have post-market studies in place to collect their own data for their medical device - which would need to be validated, where relevant, by an Approved Body (i.e. except where the medical device is a Class I device).</p>

<p>c. manufacturers of certain medical devices e.g. implantable and Class III medical devices must, in their clinical evaluation for the device, include data from their own clinical investigations unless:</p>

<p>i. the medical device has been designed by minor modifications of an entirely equivalent medical device with a sufficient clinical evaluation, already marketed by the same manufacturer (the MHRA would provide guidance as to what constitutes a minor modification)</p>

<p>ii. the medical device is on an exempt list of medical devices and the clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data</p>

<p>iii. In the above cases the manufacturer would still be required to have post-market studies in place to collect their own data for the medical device and this would need to be validated by an Approved Body.</p>

<p>Q31.1 Do you think that the specific requirements, outlined in paragraph 31.11, that relate to claiming equivalence should be introduced?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q31.2. Please provide any additional information (for example outline what requirements you think should be introduced around claiming equivalence or explain why you do not agree that additional requirements should be introduced).</p>

<h4>Products without an intended medical purpose</h4>

<p>31.12. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to require that clinical investigations or other pre-market studies involving human subjects / participants are performed for products without an intended medical purpose (see Chapter 1, Section 2), and that we propose to regulate such products under the UK medical devices regulations, unless reliance on existing clinical data from an entirely equivalent medical device is duly justified. This would bring a number of products without an intended medical purpose, such as non-prescription coloured contact lenses, or dermal fillers without a stated medical purpose into scope of these requirements, with the aim of delivering improved public and patient safety.</p>

<p>Q31.3. Do you think that manufacturers of products without an intended medical purpose should be required to perform clinical investigations or other pre-market studies involving human subjects / participants as set out in paragraph 31.12?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h3>Section 32 - Performance evaluation (IVDs)</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>32.1. Manufacturers of <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) are not required to perform clinical evaluations. Instead they must conduct performance evaluations of their IVDs to ensure that they meet the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK medical devices regulations). This is because, while IVDs must be able to provide accurate medical information on individuals, the final clinical outcome for the patient is dependent on further diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. The data gathered through performance evaluation are used to build the clinical evidence for the IVD, i.e., the proof that the IVD is safe and achieves the intended clinical benefit.</p>

<p>32.2. As part of the performance evaluation, the manufacturer must systematically collect, analyse and assess the data relevant to the IVD in order to establish or verify the performance of the IVD.</p>

<p>32.3. This performance evaluation is assessed by the Approved Body, where required, during the conformity assessment for the IVD.</p>

<p>32.4. Under the UK medical devices regulations, manufacturers of IVDs must provide adequate performance evaluation data as evidence of the performance of the IVD claimed by the manufacturer. No further requirements regarding performance evaluation are currently included under the UK regulations.</p>

<p>32.5. The UK medical devices regulations could include more detailed requirements for how a performance evaluation must be conducted and documented by the medical device manufacturer. The objective of this would be to ensure that medical device manufacturers conduct effective performance evaluations of their IVDs in a consistent and systematic way, which takes into account all the relevant data, in order to demonstrate that an IVD performs as intended. This would help ensure that IVDs are not placed on the UK market unless there is sufficient evidence of their safety and performance.</p>

<h3>Possible Changes and Questions</h3>

<h4>Clinical, scientific and analytical data requirements</h4>

<p>32.6. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to explicitly require in legislation that conformity of an IVD with the UK medical devices regulations is based on conformance with the essential requirements. The Regulations could, in particular, explicitly require evidence of scientific validity, and analytical and clinical performance data that provide sufficient clinical evidence. Manufacturers could be required to document this data in a performance evaluation report, to be included as part of the technical documentation for the device.</p>

<p>Q32.1. Do you think that confirmation of conformity of an IVD with the UK medical devices regulations should be based on scientific validity, analytical and clinical performance data?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q32.2 Do you think that manufacturers should be required to produce a performance evaluation report as part of the technical documentation for the device?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h4>Performance evaluation requirements</h4>

<p>32.7. The MHRA has identified that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to provide additional requirements for IVD manufacturers conducting performance evaluations. This could include more detailed requirements for the scope and content of a performance evaluation, including how a manufacturer must demonstrate the scientific validity and the analytical and clinical performance of the IVD. It could also include more detailed requirements regarding how the manufacturer should demonstrate that they have sufficient clinical evidence (data which shows the medical device is safe and performs as intended) and how a performance evaluation should be documented. These issues are explored in more detail below.</p>

<h4>Clinical evidence requirements</h4>

<p>32.8. Currently, as set out above, IVD manufacturers must provide performance evaluation data to show that the device is safe and performs as intended. Data gathered through an IVD performance evaluation, in addition to other clinical data, contributes to the clinical evidence for an IVD. The UK medical devices regulations do not currently refer specifically to clinical evidence requirements.</p>

<p>32.9. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to outline clinical evidence requirements. For example, the Regulations could require manufacturers to specify and justify the level of the clinical evidence necessary to demonstrate that the device is safe and performs as intended. Manufacturers could be required to include in their clinical evidence for an IVD, evidence from their own clinical performance studies (studies undertaken to confirm the analytical or clinical performance of a medical device) unless they can justify reliance on other sources of clinical performance data.</p>

<p>32.10.  In addition, manufacturers could be required to continue to update the clinical evidence throughout the lifecycle of the device, for example, through ongoing monitoring of scientific developments and changes in medical practice. This would be a new regulatory requirement. Please note that additional questions, covering transitional arrangements for performance studies, are set out in Chapter 15.</p>

<p>Q32.3. Do you think manufacturers should be required to specify and justify the level of clinical evidence necessary to demonstrate conformity with the UK medical devices regulations?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q32.4. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should require manufacturers to rely on data from their own clinical performance studies unless they can justify reliance on other sources of clinical performance data?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q32.5. If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 32.4, please outline what factors you think this justification could include.</p>

<p>32.11. The UK medical devices regulations do not currently set out post-market requirements in relation to IVD performance evaluations. The MHRA considers that the Regulations could be amended to require that manufacturers update the clinical evidence for a medical device throughout the lifetime of that device. Manufacturers could also be required to update other technical documentation relating to their IVD with performance evaluation data. In particular, manufacturers could be required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>update the summary of safety and clinical performance (SSCP) (a mechanism for collating information on the medical device’s safety, clinical data, and clinical performance. (see Chapter 7, Section 47), and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>update the post-market performance follow-up report (PMPF) (a continuous process that updates the performance evaluation specifically addressed in the manufacturer’s post-market surveillance plan) (see Chapter 8).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Q32.6. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should require that the performance evaluation is updated throughout the lifetime of the IVD and used to update the technical documentation listed in paragraph 32.11?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q32.7 If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 32.6, please outline how you think the performance evaluation should be updated by the manufacturer and if there is any other technical documentation which should be updated.</p>

<p>Q32.8. Please provide your reasoning (including any available relevant evidence) to support your answers to questions 32.1-32.7, including any impacts on you or other stakeholder groups.</p>

<h3>Section 33 - General requirements regarding clinical investigations (general medical devices)</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>33.1. A clinical investigation is any systematic investigation involving one or more human subject(s), undertaken to assess the safety and performance of a medical device.</p>

<p>33.2. Currently, manufacturers are, in certain circumstances, required to carry out a clinical investigation to demonstrate that their medical device complies with the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK medical devices regulations).</p>

<p>33.3. All clinical investigations need a sponsor who must take responsibility for the initiation, management and financing the clinical investigation.</p>

<p>33.4. The UK medical devices regulations currently set out limited requirements for clinical investigations. These requirements could be updated to include additional detail and clarity so that clinical investigations are carried out appropriately and in a consistent manner. The objective would be to more effectively safeguard the health and welfare of clinical investigation participants and ensure that appropriate clinical data is obtained for a device in order to draw accurate, evidence-based conclusions about its safety and/or performance.</p>

<h3>Possible Changes and Questions</h3>

<h4>Requirements for clinical investigations</h4>

<p>33.5. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to set out that clinical investigations conducted for one or more of the following purposes shall be designed, authorised, conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the UK medical devices regulations:</p>

<p>a. to establish and verify that, under normal conditions of use the medical device achieves the performance intended by its manufacturer</p>

<p>b. to establish and verify the clinical benefits of a medical device as specified by its manufacturer</p>

<p>c. to establish and verify the clinical safety of the medical device and to determine any undesirable side-effects, under normal conditions of use of the medical device, and assess whether they constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to be achieved by the medical device.</p>

<p>Q33.1. Do you think that clinical investigations regulated under the UK medical devices regulations should be limited to those carried out for one of the purposes outlined in paragraph 33.5?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h4>Requirement for non-UK clinical investigation and performance study sponsors to appoint a UK-based legal representative</h4>

<p>33.6. The MHRA considers that the UK medical device regulations could be amended to require that, where the sponsor of a clinical investigation is not established in the UK, that sponsor shall ensure that a person is established in the UK as its legal representative. This requirement could also be made in relation to non-UK-based sponsors of IVD performance studies. The UK medical devices regulations could require that this legal representative is responsible for ensuring compliance with the sponsor’s obligations and acts as the addressee for all communications with the sponsor. The UK medical devices regulations could provide that any communication with that legal representative shall be deemed to be a communication with the sponsor.</p>

<p>Q33.2. Do you think that, if the sponsor is based outside the UK, they should be required to appoint a legal representative in the UK as outlined in paragraph 33.6?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.3. Do you think that the legal representative should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the sponsor’s obligations and be the addressee for all communications with the sponsor?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.4. Do you think that any communication with that legal representative should be deemed to be communication with the sponsor?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h4>Sponsor obligations</h4>

<p>33.7. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to set out the obligations applicable to the sponsor of a clinical investigation. This could include requirements for the sponsor to:</p>

<p>a. provide and make publicly available a summary of the study, at the time of submitting a formal clinical investigation application to the MHRA and at the time of notifying the MHRA when a clinical investigation has come to an end</p>

<p>b. keep technical documentation available for the MHRA for a specified time period after the clinical investigation has been carried out – including where the sponsor goes bankrupt or ceases activity prior to this period. The UK medical devices regulations currently require that the technical documentation is kept available for a minimum period of five years. We are proposing to increase this to a minimum period of 10 years after the last device was placed on the market for most devices and 15 years for implantable devices</p>

<p>c. ensure that, in addition to the current requirement under the UK medical devices regulations to report any serious adverse events to the MHRA, the following are also reported in a timely manner:</p>

<p>i. any adverse event of a type identified in the clinical investigation plan as being critical to the evaluation of the results of that clinical investigation</p>

<p>ii. any device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate</p>

<p>d. appoint a monitor that is independent from the investigational site to ensure that the clinical investigation is conducted in accordance with the clinical investigation plan (CIP), the principles of good clinical practice and the UK medical devices regulations</p>

<p>e. provide evidence that the investigation is being conducted in line with good clinical practice, for instance through internal or external inspection</p>

<p>f. prepare a clinical investigation report.</p>

<p>Q33.5. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should set out the obligations of the sponsor, including those outlined in paragraph 33.7?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.6. Please outline any other requirements which should be introduced for the sponsor.</p>

<h4>Clinical investigation report</h4>

<p>33.8. The UK medical devices regulations require that a written report of a clinical investigation must be produced. This must contain a critical evaluation of all the data collected during the clinical investigation. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to specifically require sponsors to prepare and publish a clinical investigation report and could set out the minimum requirements for the report. This would help ensure a more consistent and comprehensive approach to compiling clinical investigation reports. These requirements could include, for example:</p>

<p>a. title of the investigation, details of the investigational device and details of the author</p>

<p>b. a summary of the investigation - covering purpose, investigational design, methods used, results and conclusion</p>

<p>c. the completion date of the investigation, and any details of early termination, temporary halts or suspensions of investigations</p>

<p>d. investigational device description and intended purpose</p>

<p>e. a summary of the clinical investigation plan - covering objectives, design, ethical aspects, monitoring and quality measures, selection criteria, target patient populations, sample size, treatment schedules, follow-up duration, concomitant treatments and statistical plan</p>

<p>f. results of the clinical investigation covering, with rationale and justification, subject demographics, analysis of results, details of subgroup analysis</p>

<p>g. summary of serious adverse events, adverse device effects, device deficiencies and any relevant corrective actions</p>

<p>h. discussion and overall conclusions covering safety and performance results and assessment of risks and clinical benefits.</p>

<p>33.9.  The UK medical devices regulations could be amended to require the sponsor to publish a publicly accessible version of the clinical investigation report. The objective would be to improve public and patient safety through increased transparency. If we were to introduce this requirement, we would take account of data protection obligations and commercially confidentiality considerations.</p>

<p>Q33.7. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should set out the minimum requirements for the clinical investigation report, including those outlined in paragraph 33.8?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.8. Please outline any other requirements which should be introduced for the clinical investigation report.</p>

<p>Q33.9. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should require the sponsor to publish the clinical investigation report?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h4>Requirements for conducting clinical investigations</h4>

<p>33.10. The UK medical devices regulations currently include requirements regarding the objectives, methods and ethical considerations for a clinical investigation. The Regulations could be amended to further clarify and supplement the existing requirements - for example, that:</p>

<p>a. as part of the study’s investigational design, a list of the technical and functional features of the device and the related expected clinical outcomes shall be provided</p>

<p>b. the endpoints of the clinical investigation shall address the intended purpose, and clinical benefits</p>

<p>c. the endpoints shall be determined and assessed using scientifically valid methodologies – and the primary endpoint shall be appropriate to the device and clinically relevant</p>

<p>d. personnel involved in the conduct of an investigation shall be adequately instructed and trained in the proper use of the investigational device and good clinical practice. This training shall be verified and where necessary arranged by the sponsor and documented appropriately</p>

<p>e. the clinical investigation report must include any negative findings.</p>

<p>Q33.10. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should include the additional detailed requirements relating to the methods for a clinical investigation as outlined in paragraph 33.10?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.11. Please outline any other requirements which should be introduced relating to the methods for a clinical investigation.</p>

<h4>Clinical investigation plan</h4>

<p>33.11. The UK medical devices regulations currently require that clinical investigations must be performed on the basis of an appropriate plan of investigation reflecting the latest scientific and technical knowledge and defined in such a way as to confirm or refute the manufacturer’s claims for the device.</p>

<p>33.12. The MHRA considers that the Regulations could be amended to set out more detailed requirements regarding what must be included in the clinical investigation plan (CIP), to help ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach. This could include requirements for the CIP to set out the rationale, objectives, design methodology, monitoring, conduct, record keeping and the method of analysis for the clinical investigation. Specific requirements could be for the CIP to include, for example:</p>

<p>a. details of the sponsor and, where applicable, the sponsor’s legal representative established in the UK, the principal investigator at each investigational site and the coordinating investigator for the investigation.</p>

<p>b.  a brief description of how the clinical investigation is financed and of the agreement between the sponsor and the site</p>

<p>c. an overall synopsis of the clinical investigation</p>

<p>d. identification and description of the device, including its intended purpose, manufacturer and traceability, the target population and materials coming into contact with the human body</p>

<p>e. risks and clinical benefits of the device to be examined</p>

<p>f. objectives and hypotheses of the clinical investigation</p>

<p>g. design of the clinical investigation with evidence of its scientific robustness and validity</p>

<p>h. information on subjects, including selection criteria, size of investigation population and representativeness of investigation population in relation to target population</p>

<p>i. details of measures to be taken to minimise bias, such as randomisation, and management of potential confounding factors</p>

<p>j. a monitoring plan, including data management and accountability for the device</p>

<p>k. description of the Informed consent process</p>

<p>l. safety reporting, including definitions of adverse events and serious adverse events, device deficiencies, procedures and timelines for reporting.</p>

<p>Q33.12. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should set out the detailed requirements for the clinical investigation plan, including those outlined in paragraph 33.12?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.13. Please outline any other requirements should be introduced for the clinical investigation plan.</p>

<h4>Conditions that must be met when performing a clinical investigation</h4>

<p>33.13.  The UK medical devices regulations currently set out the conditions that must be met when performing a clinical investigation. For example, the Regulations provide that the clinical investigation is subject to authorisation by the MHRA and that an ethics committee must have issued a favourable opinion in relation to the investigation. The MHRA considers that these conditions could be expanded to specifically include, for example:</p>

<p>a. the sponsor, or its legal representative or a contact person pursuant to paragraph 33.6, is established in the UK (as set out in paragraph 33.6)</p>

<p>b. vulnerable populations and subjects are appropriately protected</p>

<p>c. certain populations, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, are not excluded from a clinical investigation unless adequately justified</p>

<p>d. the anticipated benefits to the subjects or to public health justify the foreseeable risks and inconveniences - and compliance with this condition is constantly monitored</p>

<p>e. the subject or, where the subject is not able to give informed consent, his or her legally designated representative has given informed consent in accordance with Section 35</p>

<p>f. the subject or, where the subject is not able to give informed consent, his or her legally designated representative, has been provided with the contact details of an entity where further information can be received in case of need</p>

<p>g. the rights of the subject to physical and mental integrity, to privacy and to the protection of the data concerning him or her in accordance with relevant data protection legislation are safeguarded</p>

<p>h. the medical care provided to the subjects is the responsibility of a licensed medical practitioner or registered healthcare practitioner to provide the relevant patient care under clinical investigation conditions</p>

<p>i. no undue influence, including that of a financial nature, is exerted on the subject, or, where applicable, on his or her legally designated representatives, to participate in the clinical investigation</p>

<p>j. the enhanced requirements for the clinical investigation application, report and plan (as outlined in section 38) are fulfilled</p>

<p>k. the enhanced sponsor obligations are fulfilled (as outlined in paragraph 33.7).</p>

<p>Q33.14. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should set out the requirements that must be met for performing a clinical investigation, including those outlined in paragraph 33.13?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q33.15. Please outline any other requirements that should be met when performing a clinical evaluation.</p>

<h4>Rights of participants to withdraw from a clinical investigation</h4>

<p>33.14. The UK medical devices regulations do not currently address the rights of subjects / participants to withdraw from clinical investigations.

<h3>Section 34 - General requirements regarding performance studies (IVDs)</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>34.1. A performance study is a study undertaken to establish or confirm the analytical or clinical performance of an IVD.</p>

<p>34.2. Manufacturers may be required to carry out a performance study to demonstrate that their <em>in vitro</em> diagnostic medical device (IVD) complies with the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK medical devices regulations).</p>

<p>34.3. The UK medical devices regulations include limited requirements for performance studies on IVDs. Additional requirements could be introduced to ensure that performance studies are carried out in a consistent way, that appropriate data is obtained and that the health and welfare of participants (where applicable) is protected.</p>

<h4>Possible Changes and Questions</h4>

<h4>Requirements for all performance studies</h4>

<p>34.4. The UK medical devices regulations do not currently set any requirements regarding the circumstances and conditions of use in which a performance study should be carried out. The MHRA considers that the Regulations could be amended to provide that, where appropriate, performance studies should be performed in circumstances similar to the normal conditions of use of the medical device. Possible exemptions from this requirement could include, for example, self-test IVDs in cases where it is necessary to conduct the performance study in a clinical setting or cases where invasive samples are required, and the performance study can be conducted on left-over lab samples.</p>

<p>Q34.1. *Do you think we should require that, where appropriate, performance studies be performed in circumstances similar to the normal conditions of use of the medical device?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h4>Additional requirements for certain performance studies</h4>

<p>34.5. The UK medical devices regulations could detail additional specific requirements that would apply to any performance study:</p>

<p>a. in which surgically invasive sample-taking is done only for the purpose of the performance study</p>

<p>b. that is an interventional clinical performance study (a study in which the test results are intended to be used in patient management or treatment), or</p>

<p>c. where the conduct of the study involves additional invasive procedures or other risks for the subjects of the studies.</p>

<p>These performance studies could be required to meet the requirements of this Section as well as other Sections in this Chapter (Chapter 7) relating to performance studies.</p>

<p>Q34.2. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should set out in detail the specific requirements for the performance studies in paragraph 34.5 above?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q34.3. If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 34.2, please outline what you think the specific requirements of the performance study should be.</p>

<h4>Sponsor obligations</h4>

<p>34.6. The UK medical devices regulations require that an IVD manufacturer or their UK Responsible Person draw up a statement that includes data allowing the identification of the device in question, an evaluation plan, the list of laboratories or other institutions participating in the evaluation study, information about study timings and participants and confirmation that the device conforms with the requirements of the Regulations other than aspects covered by the evaluation.</p>

<p>34.7. The MHRA considers that, for clarity, the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to set out, in addition, specific obligations for the sponsor of a performance study. This could include obligations to:</p>

<p>a. report a summary of the study outcome to MHRA</p>

<p>b. provide a publicly accessible summary of the study, at the time of registration and upon completion of the study</p>

<p>c. keep technical documentation available for the MHRA for a specified time period after the performance study has been carried out – including where the sponsor goes bankrupt or ceases activity prior to this period. This documentation must currently be kept for a period ending at least five years after the end of the performance evaluation. We are considering extending this to 10 years after the last device has been placed on the market</p>

<p>d. have an agreement in place to ensure that any serious adverse events or any medical device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event are reported by the investigator or investigators to the sponsor in a timely manner</p>

<p>e. appoint a monitor that is independent from the investigational site to ensure that the clinical performance study is conducted in accordance with the clinical performance study plan (CPSP), the principles of good clinical practice and the UK medical devices regulations</p>

<p>f. complete the follow-up of investigation subjects and devices involved in the performance study.</p>

<p>Q34.17. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should require the clinical performance study report be published?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h4>Ethical review</h4>

<p>34.11. Performance studies that involve the use of human samples are in some circumstances subject to ethical review. The ethical review is performed by an ethics committee either before or in parallel with notification to the MHRA. The MHRA considers that the manufacturer should be required to submit a copy of the research ethics committee approval to the MHRA.</p>

<p>34.12. However, in certain circumstances – for example, when de-identified surplus samples are used by laboratories for assay validation and verification, a review by an ethics committee is not required. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to clarify that any performance study involving human samples must be subject to a review by an ethics committee.</p>

<p>Q34.18. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should require ALL performance studies involving human samples to be subject to ethical review by an ethics committee?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

There are currently no requirements, for example, regarding the appropriateness or fitness for purpose of the facility in which the study is conducted (for example, in terms of the laboratory, equipment and expertise of study personnel).</p>

<p>34.19. Similarly, the UK medical devices regulations do not currently set requirements for the appropriateness of the study’s setting and users to the intended setting in which the IVD will be used and intended user population.</p>

<p>34.20. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to require that, where appropriate, the settings and facilities in which a performance study is to be conducted are similar to the settings and facilities where the medical device is intended to be used. In addition, the Regulations could require that, where appropriate, the study’s users are representative of the intended users (e.g. self-testing, near patient and laboratory professional use, healthcare professionals) of the IVD subject to the performance study. For example, if the medical device is intended to be used as a self-test in a home setting, the performance study should mirror this.</p>

<p>Q34.27. Do you think that the UK medical devices regulations should require that, where appropriate, the facilities where the performance study is to be conducted should be suitable for the conduct of the study?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<h3>Section 46 - Types of clinical investigations / performance studies and exemptions / authorisations</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>46.1. The requirements under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK medical devices regulations) can, in some cases, create barriers for certain organisations, such as academic institutions, that may wish to carry out certain types of clinical investigation or performance study. This in turn could potentially prevent new devices coming to market, thus reducing the availability of different types of device on the UK market and hindering innovation.</p>

<p>46.2. The MHRA considers that, in specific circumstances, exemptions to certain requirements of the UK medical devices regulations could be put in place. This could apply, for example, in relation to smaller early feasibility clinical investigations or to performance studies carried out by academic institutions that will be followed up with further studies, where there is no involvement from industry.</p>

<p>46.3. Health institutions that manufacture devices for use in house and that do not intend to place such devices on the market are currently exempt from the UK medical devices regulations (please see Chapter 3, Section 8 for further information on and possible amendments to the health institution exemption).The MHRA considers this type of exemption may not be appropriate in certain circumstances - for example, in cases where a large number of patients are involved in a pivotal clinical investigation or performance study, or where the investigation or study results would be particularly significant.</p>

<h4>Possible Changes and Questions</h4>

<p>46.4. The MHRA considers that the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to include exemptions from some of the requirements of the UK medical devices regulations for certain clinical investigations and performance studies. This could apply, for example, in cases where an academic institute is working with a health institution to conduct a proof of concept or early feasibility study (limited clinical investigation of a device early in development, typically used to evaluate the device design concept with respect to initial clinical safety) on a medical device without any input from industry, and there is no intention to place the device on the market. However, all studies would still need to be registered with the MHRA before taking place.</p>

<p>Q46.1. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should allow for exemptions from some of the requirements of the Regulations for certain types of clinical investigations and performance studies as outlined in paragraph 46.4?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q46.2. If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 46.1 please outline what types of clinical investigations and performance studies you think should be exempted.</p>

<p>46.5. Please see Chapter 3, Section 8 for further information on exemptions for health institutions from certain requirements of the UK medical devices regulations. The MHRA considers that the Regulations could be amended to ensure that certain types of clinical investigation and performance study conducted by health institutions must be notified to the MHRA for authorisation before proceeding. This could include, for example, larger pivotal or confirmatory clinical investigation studies which are conducted to provide the information necessary to evaluate the clinical performance, effectiveness or safety of the investigational device.</p>

<p>Q46.3. Do you think that healthcare institutions should be required to notify certain types of clinical investigation / performance studies to the MHRA for authorisation before proceeding?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q46.4. If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 46.3 please outline what types of clinical investigations / performance studies should meet the requirements of the UK medical devices regulations.</p>

<p>Q46.5 Please provide your reasoning (including any available relevant evidence) to support your answers to questions 46.1-46.4, including any impacts on you or other stakeholder groups.</p>

<h3>Section 47 - Summary of safety and clinical performance</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>47.1. There is currently no requirement for manufacturers of medical devices to make clinical data publicly available for medical devices placed on the Great Britain market.</p>

<p>47.2. We could introduce a requirement for manufacturers of certain medical devices to publish data on device safety and performance following UKCA marking, for intended users of the medical device.</p>

<p>47.3. This could provide users and potential users of a medical device, including patients and clinicians, with a means of obtaining accessible and easy to understand information about a medical device, thus enhancing transparency and enabling clinicians and patients/users to make more informed decisions about medical devices.</p>

<p>47.4. This information could be captured in the form of a ‘summary of safety and clinical performance (SSCP)’ which could include information on the medical device’s safety, clinical data, and clinical performance.</p>

<h4>Possible Changes and Questions</h4>

<h4>Minimum requirements for the SSCP</h4>

<p>47.5. The MHRA considers that the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK medical devices regulations) could be amended to set out the minimum requirements for what should be included in the SSCP. Such requirements could include:</p>

<p>a. the identification of the medical device and the manufacturer, including the Basic UDI-DI and, if already issued, the MHRA identifying number for registration</p>

<p>b. the intended purpose of the medical device and any indications, contra-indications and target populations</p>

<p>c. a description of the medical device, including a reference to previous generation(s) or variants if such exist, and a description of the differences, as well as, where relevant, a description of any accessories, other medical devices and products, which are intended to be used in combination with the medical device</p>

<p>h. the summary of the clinical investigation/performance evaluation, and relevant information on the post-market clinical follow-up</p>

<p>i. suggested profile and training for users</p>

<p>j. information on any residual risks and any undesirable effects, warnings and precautions including disclosing potential allergenic ingredients</p>

<p>k. summary of the Approved Body conformity assessment.</p>

<p>47.6. The UK medical devices regulations could be amended to require medical device manufacturers to produce an SSCP, written in plain English, for certain types of medical devices. Such medical devices could include:</p>

<p>a. Class III medical devices (excluding investigational medical devices)</p>

<p>b. Implantable medical devices (excluding investigational medical devices)</p>

<p>c. High to medium risk IVDs i.e. those that would be classed as List A and List B under the UK medical devices regulations (excluding custom-made medical devices and medical devices for performance study).</p>

<p>Q47.1. Do you think the UK medical devices regulations should introduce the requirement for an SSCP for medical devices?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q47.2. If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 47.1, please outline what classes/types of medical devices should require an SSCP.</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q47.4. Please outline any other content which should be included in the SSCP for a medical device.</p>

<p>47.7. As expanded on in Chapter 4, Section 20, the UK medical devices regulations could be amended to require manufacturers to upload the full SSCP or a link to the SSCP (hosted externally) to the MHRA registration system.</p>

<p>Q47.5. Please select one of the following:</p>

<p>a. the manufacturer should upload the full SSCP to the MHRA registration system</p>

<p>b. the manufacturer should upload a link to the SSCP to the registration system</p>

<p>c. the manufacturer should not be required to upload the SSCP to the registration system</p>

<p>d. other – please specify</p>

<p>e. don’t know/no opinion</p>

<p>47.8. The UK medical devices regulations could be amended to require Approved Bodies to validate the SSCP. This could work in the following way:</p>

<p>a. the medical device manufacturer to submit the draft of the SSCP to the Approved Body involved in the conformity assessment of the medical device</p>

<p>b. the Approved Body to validate the SSCP</p>

<p>c. the medical device manufacturer to upload the validated SSCP to the MHRA registration system (where a draft SSCP has initially been uploaded)</p>

<p>Q47.6. Do you think an Approved Body should validate the SSCP for a medical device?</p>

<p>(‘Yes’ / ’No’ / ’Don’t Know/No Opinion’)</p>

<p>Q47.7. If you have answered ‘yes’ to question 47.6, please outline how this procedure should be carried out.</p>

<p>Q47.8. Please provide your reasoning (including any available relevant evidence) to support your answers to questions 47.1-47.7, including any impacts on you or other stakeholder groups.</p>
