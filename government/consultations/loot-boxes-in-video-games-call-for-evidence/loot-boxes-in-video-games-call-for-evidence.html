<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK has played an important role in the development of the global video games sector. The creativity and innovation of our pioneering games designers helped lead to pivotal series such as Lemmings, Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto. More recent examples of the high-quality output from the British games industry includes the BAFTA award winning Lego series, the Forza Horizon games and Dreams.</p>

<p>This has helped to establish the UK as one of the major centres of the global video games industry. As a result, the UK’s world-class video games sector is now one of the key components in our influential creative industries. Video games in the UK contributed £2.6bn in gross value added (GVA) in 2018 and employed 27,000 people in 2019.</p>

<p>The audience for video games in the UK has also continued to grow. Now played by over half the population in the UK<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, games allow people to enjoy fun and exciting play, find moments of relaxation, socialise, and learn new skills.</p>

<p>However, whilst video games have become an important part of the economic and social fabric of the UK, they undoubtedly also present new responsibilities for everyone including the government to ensure that players - particularly children and young people - are not exposed to harm. Given the pace of evolution in this sector, the government’s challenge is to create policies that are effective within the context of constant innovation.</p>

<p>The government wants the UK to be the safest place to be online in the world. This involves leading efforts to set a coherent, proportionate and effective approach to online safety, while taking action where necessary. Specifically in relation to video games, the government is aware of concerns around loot boxes and takes them very seriously.</p>

<p>Loot boxes (see Box 1 below) are a feature in video games containing randomised items in which the player does not know what they are going to get until they have opened the loot box (see Box 2 below). They are not a new addition in games but they have grown in profile in recent years.</p>

<p>In 2019, the government committed to review the Gambling Act 2005 with a particular focus on tackling issues around online loot boxes. This was followed by the announcement on 8 June 2020 in the government’s response to the DCMS Select Committee Immersive and Addictive Technologies Inquiry<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> that the government will launch a call for evidence to gather evidence and understand the impact of loot boxes.</p>

<p>The results from this call for evidence will be considered alongside the review of the Gambling Act 2005 and will inform future actions in regard to loot boxes. The government stands ready to take action should the outcomes of the call for evidence support taking a new approach to ensure users, and particularly children and young people, are protected.</p>

<p>BOX 1 - DEFINING LOOT BOXES</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Loot boxes are features in video games which may be accessed through gameplay, or purchased with in-game items, virtual currencies, or directly with real-world money. They contain randomised items, so players do not know what they will get before opening them, but they will get something. The items are usually either cosmetic i.e. items of clothing for avatars etc, or power-ups to improve the playing experience. Loot boxes vary in the way they are accessed, their cost, how the random reward is selected and in the content they return. They are a form of microtransaction where they are available as an in-game purchase. However, loot boxes are only one part of the in-game purchase market. Their unique element is the chance mechanism. For other forms of in-game purchase, players will know what item they will receive in advance of purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BOX 2 - PROBABILITY RATES</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The probability rate, or the drop rate is the probability of receiving a certain item in each loot box. For example, where an item has a 5% probability rate, there is a 5% chance the loot box will yield that item on each opening. Probability rates may be variable per loot box opening or fixed. On a voluntary basis, the video games industry is taking steps to improve transparency by making probability rates accessible for players. Games available on the Apple App Store and Google Play are required to display probability rates for loot boxes. Major platform operators Sony Interactive Entertainment, Microsoft and Nintendo announced that they will introduce in 2020 a requirement that any new games on their platforms will have to display the relative probability of receiving the randomised virtual item.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> This was followed by a commitment made by several major publishers in the UK, through their trade association Ukie, to do the same in their games by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>BOX 3 - PEGI RATINGS AND LABELS</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system was introduced for video games in the UK in 2003. The age ratings are PEGI 3, PEGI 7, PEGI 12, PEGI 16 and PEGI 18. The system is administered in the UK by the Video Standards Council Rating Board. Since 2012 PEGI ratings have been a legal requirement under the Video Recordings Act 1984 in the UK for any games supplied in physical formats - generally boxed games on discs and cartridges - which are unsuitable for younger children. It is an offence for anyone to sell a physical format game that is rated PEGI 12, 16 or 18 to someone younger than the set age limit for the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">PEGI ratings are also applied voluntarily by industry to many games supplied directly to connected devices, for example downloadable games and browser-based games. The government is working to encourage games publishers and platforms to sign up to this system and ensure that all of their online games carry the appropriate PEGI age ratings.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Alongside the age ratings symbols, PEGI also applies descriptor labels to video games to provide additional information on the content within games. These labels indicate where games include the following elements:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Violence</li>
  <li>Bad language</li>
  <li>Fear (content that may be frightening for some players)</li>
  <li>Sex</li>
  <li>Drugs</li>
  <li>Discrimination</li>
  <li>Gambling (depictions that encourage or teach gambling)</li>
  <li>In-game purchases</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In April 2020, PEGI introduced additional information to the in-game purchase label to note where games contain “paid random items”.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> This was introduced to indicate when loot boxes are available to buy in games.</p>
