<p>The government’s LGBT+ Business Champion, Iain Anderson, wants to hear from employers, staff networks, trade unions and civil society organisations with practical experience of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating LGBT+ inclusive workplaces</li>
  <li>supporting LGBT+ inclusion in their wider environment</li>
  <li>improving outcomes and experiences for LGBT+ people</li>
</ul>

<p>The LGBT Business Champion is looking for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practical examples of what businesses are doing to improve LGBT+ outcomes and experiences in their workplace and wider environment</li>
  <li>examples of what works</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who can respond</h2>

<p>The LGBT+ Business Champion wants to hear from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employers</li>
  <li>staff networks</li>
  <li>trade unions</li>
  <li>civil society organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>This call to engage is not to gain responses from people about their personal experience or their views of LGBT+ equality in the workplace. We will not be considering any responses that provide personal experiences or views.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Please answer one or more of the following questions. You do not need to answer all 4 questions.</p>

<h3>Question 1</h3>

<p>What is your organisation doing to improve the collection of LGBT+ diversity and inclusion data of employees?</p>

<p>Please provide any available evidence that this has been effective.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>

<p>What is your organisation doing to improve the outcomes and experiences of LGBT+ employees in the workplace?</p>

<p>If you are able to disaggregate how you have supported lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans employees, please do so. Please provide any available evidence that this has been effective.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>

<p>For organisations which operate in countries where LGBT+ people routinely experience discrimination, what is your organisation doing to support the safety and advocacy of LGBT+ staff?</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>

<p>How does your organisation have a positive social and economic impact on LGBT+ equality, including in countries where LGBT+ people routinely experience discrimination (where relevant)?</p>

<p>We are particularly interested in impacts outside your organisation, such as evidence of how your organisation has had a positive influence through supply chains, distributors and customers.</p>

<h2>How to respond</h2>

<p>Please send your response to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LGBTatWork@geo.gov.uk">LGBTatWork@geo.gov.uk</a> by 11.45pm on Thursday 12 May 2022.</p>

<p>We would prefer to receive responses in either PDF or Word.</p>

<p>Please include the following details about your organisation in your response:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of your organisation</li>
  <li>sector</li>
  <li>number of employees – you can estimate this if actual numbers are not available</li>
  <li>which countries your organisation operates in – and specifically whether you operate in countries where LGBT+ people routinely experience discrimination</li>
</ul>

<p>Please include your contact details (email address and telephone number) so we can reach out to engage further.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please do not submit personal or identifiable information other than your workplace contact details.</p>
</div>

<h2>How we will use your information</h2>

<p>The LGBT+ Business Champion will contact respondents who submit the most exciting and promising evidence, to work together to share these with employers in the UK and abroad.</p>

<p>With respondents’ permission, the evidence provided may also be discussed at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/safe-to-be-me-a-global-equality-conference">Safe To Be Me: A Global Equality Conference</a>, taking place in London from 29 June to 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>We may also ask respondents to take part in discussions that the LGBT+ Business Champion is hosting around the UK to discuss creating inclusive workplaces and wider environments.</p>

<p>We will not contact all respondents. We will only contact those who submit evidence of particular interest. We will not publish or use any evidence submitted without asking for your permission – because of this, we remind all respondents to include your workplace contact details in case we want to follow up with you.</p>
