<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>In November 2020, the Government published its Social Housing White Paper, setting out plans for a new consumer regulation regime. One element was the requirement that the Regulator of Social Housing develop clear and comparable tenant satisfaction measures. These measures should apply to all social landlords and cover the areas that matter to their tenants.</p>

<p>The White Paper recommends that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should give tenants meaningful information about their landlord and help the regulator ensure that landlords meet the new consumer standards. We need legislation to introduce the new consumer regulation regime, but in advance of that we think it’s right to consult on our <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> proposals because of the significant lead time for their implementation.</p>

<p>We have taken the White Paper as our starting point, and have spoken to tenants, landlords and sector representatives to help us develop our proposals. We aim to arrive at <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that are comparable between landlords but also allow the right amount of flexibility so that landlords can ensure their information is relevant to them and their tenants and will help them manage their own performance.</p>

<p>We have recently published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reshaping-consumer-regulation-our-principles-and-approach">Reshaping consumer regulation: our principles and approach</a>. This sets out our vision for our future consumer regulation role and the part that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> will play. We expect <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to tell us a lot about how landlords are performing but we also know that alone they can’t provide a full picture. Therefore, we will consider a landlord’s <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> alongside other evidence to get a rounded view of their performance.</p>

<p>We want <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to be a valuable source of information for tenants, local communities, and landlords themselves. We are keen to hear a wide range of responses to our proposals and have published a summary which can be found on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">consultation page</a> to help with this. We very much hope you will share your views with us so that they can shape the outcome of this consultation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act 2010,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advance equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share it,</p>

</ul>

<p>3.2 The protected characteristics are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, and marriage and civil partnership <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.3 As a regulator, we are mindful of our public sector equality duty. Following the conclusion of this consultation, we intend to publish an Equality Impact Assessment alongside the final <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> documents, and a draft of this Impact Assessment can be found at Annex 7.</p>

<p>3.4 Comments on our draft Equality Impact Assessment are welcome, as further explained in Chapter 14 of this document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Executive summary</h2>

<p>4.1 As the Regulator of Social Housing, we regulate registered providers of social housing in England to promote a viable, efficient and well-governed social housing sector able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs. Registered providers include non-profit organisations such as housing associations and co-operatives, profit-making registered providers, and local authorities.</p>

<p>4.2 We have both an economic and a consumer role. Our consumer regulation role applies to all registered providers, whereas our economic role does not apply to local authorities, with the exception of the Rent Standard. Our consumer role is currently limited by what is called the serious detriment test. However, as set out in the Government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">‘The Charter for Social Housing Residents: Social Housing White Paper’</a> (the White Paper), the Government is seeking to legislate as soon as is practical to remove the serious detriment test and put our economic and consumer roles on an even footing.</p>

<p>4.3 The White Paper commits to strengthening our consumer role, with the introduction of a proactive consumer regulation regime. An important part of this will be reviewing and amending our consumer standards. These set the expectations that all registered providers must meet and are the foundation of our regulation. We will be undertaking this review and consulting on changes to our consumer standards in due course once legislation has passed.</p>

<p>4.4 The White Paper also tasks the regulator with designing and implementing a set of clear and comparable <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that all registered providers must report. The White Paper aims that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should both be a useful tool for tenants to use to hold their landlord to account and a tool for us to use in our consumer regulation. In developing our proposals for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> we have developed a set of principles that we have considered throughout our work. These principles are set out in Chapter 6. This consultation puts forward proposals for a suite of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> as well as proposals for their introduction.</p>

<p>4.5 The regulator does not propose that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would be used as a regulatory tool in isolation. The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would be one source of assurance, amongst a range of other sources that the regulator would be able to use to gather assurance about a provider’s compliance with the consumer standards. We do not envisage using the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in isolation to ensure compliance with our consumer standards.</p>

<h3>Proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard</h3>

<p>4.6 We are proposing to introduce a new consumer standard (Annex 1) which would require registered providers to, among other things, collect, publish and submit information about their performance against the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in accordance with requirements set out by the regulator. In order to comply with the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, registered providers would need to ensure they meet the more detailed requirements set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements as well as in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. Drafts of these documents are presented in Annexes 2 and 3. The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard would apply to all registered providers.</p>

<h3>Proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>4.7	We are proposing to introduce 22 <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> which reflect the themes and issues set out in the White Paper. They are intended to be a core set of comparable measures that all registered providers would have to report. We have sought to strike a balance between ensuring comparability of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, being clear about definitions and giving providers flexibility to ensure the approach is appropriate for their business and their tenants.</p>

<p>4.8	We think it is appropriate that the proposals include a mix of both tenant perception measures, which would allow the views of tenants to be heard, and measures which would be collected through registered providers’ management information.</p>

<p>4.9	There are 12 tenant perception measures proposed (those with a code prefix TP) and 10 which would be collected through registered providers’ management information (those with a code prefix RP, BS, CH or NM). The areas that the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> cover are set out in Table E1 below:</p>

<p>4.10	We are mindful that there are two <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> proposed in the White Paper where Government has plans to consult on matters they relate to. This includes requirements on electrical safety and required standards for communal areas which is being looked at as part of the Decent Homes Standard review. We will therefore decide on the most appropriate action to take in relation to introducing <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in both areas once Government has concluded its work.</p>

<p>4.11	The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> as well as our rationale for our proposals are summarised in Chapter 8 of this consultation document. The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are set out in full in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2). We are seeking feedback on our proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, including how the suite works as a whole. The full list of consultation questions can be found in Annex 8.</p>

<h3>General <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> requirements</h3>

<p>4.12	Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2) sets out proposed detailed requirements for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. Key points are covered in Chapter 9 of this consultation document. As set out above, in order to comply with the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, registered providers would need to ensure they meet the more detailed requirements set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements as well as in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annexes 2 and 3). Some of the key points are set out below.</p>

<p>4.13	We propose that registered providers must report the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> on a registered group basis. This is in line with our current regulatory approach. We recognise that tenants may find data at different reporting levels useful. Our proposals do not prevent registered providers from also providing tenants with <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data at a level that is appropriate to the needs of their organisation and their tenants.</p>

<p>4.14	Where relevant, <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data must be collected for low cost rental accommodation and low cost home ownership accommodation. These terms are defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/17/contents" rel="external">Housing and Regeneration Act 2008</a> (the Act). Due to our regulatory remit, we propose that leasehold <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> homes are not included within the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data. We are also proposing that any homes that are non-social housing, or only social housing by virtue of legacy <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> provisions in the Act, are not included in the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. For the purposes of this document, the term ‘tenant’ refers to any resident of <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> or <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes owned by a provider.</p>

<p>4.15	We propose that registered providers that own 1,000 or more relevant homes be required to collect, report and publish the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually according to a reporting year 1 April to 31 March. We are mindful of our statutory duty to be proportionate and minimise interference. We therefore propose that registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes be permitted to collect and report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually according to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March.</p>

<p>4.16	We propose to publish <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data of providers that own 1,000 or more relevant homes on an annual basis. We will seek views in due course on how we do this in order that the information is accessible to a range of audiences.</p>

<h4>Tenant perception survey requirements</h4>

<p>4.17 The Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements are set out in Annex 3. This document covers the precise questions that registered providers would have to ask, the response options and proposed requirements of registered providers when surveying tenants. Key points are also set out in Chapter 10 of this document. In order for the outputs of the tenant perception survey to be comparable across landlords, there needs to be sufficient consistency in landlords’ approaches. We think that our proposals strike the right balance between ensuring a consistent approach to key aspects of survey methodology, while allowing sufficient flexibility for providers to meet requirements in a way that fits with wider objectives and a range of operating models.</p>

<p>4.18	We propose that the data for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that are tenant perception measures must be generated from tenant perception surveys rather than transactional surveys. We recognise that a number of providers may carry out transactional surveys, for example on the completion of a repair, however we consider that comparability of the data is important and that requiring registered providers to carry out tenant perception surveys (i.e., surveys carried out periodically, and not triggered by a recent interaction with the landlord) is the best way to achieve this.</p>

<p>4.19	Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3) sets out our expectations for surveying tenants. This document covers several areas including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>questionnaire structure</li>
  <li>who should be surveyed</li>
  <li>the timings of surveys</li>
  <li>the survey collection method</li>
  <li>sampling methodology</li>
  <li>whether it is carried out in-house or outsourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.20	We propose that registered providers would have to publish a summary of the methodology they have used to generate tenant perception survey data for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, alongside their published <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data. We think this is an important aspect of being transparent about how the data has been collected.</p>

<h3>Registered providers of different sizes</h3>

<p>4.21	In order to reflect our risk-based approach, and in line with our duty to exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference and (as far as is possible) is proportionate, we propose to tailor some of our requirements for registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes. Our proposals are set out in Chapter 11.</p>

<p>4.22	Our proposals include that registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would not be required to submit the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data to the regulator but would be required to publish the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to their tenants. We recognise issues with sample sizes and accuracy of data for such providers and have refined our proposals accordingly. Our proposals include allowing a census of tenants where appropriate, allowing different annual reporting periods and allowing tenant perception surveys to be carried out once every two years rather than annually.</p>

<p>4.23	We view transparency as being of fundamental importance in a co-regulatory regime and would still require all providers to communicate with us in a timely manner on material issues that relate to non-compliance or potential non-compliance with our regulatory standards.</p>

<h3>Timescales</h3>

<p>4.24	Table 1 in the next chapter (Chapter 5) summarises our current intended plan and timetable for the introduction of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, which may be subject to change.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h2>About the Regulator of Social Housing</h2>

<p>5.1	We regulate registered providers of social housing in England to promote a viable, efficient and well-governed social housing sector able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs. Registered providers include non-profit organisations such as housing associations and co-operatives, profit-making registered providers, and local authorities.</p>

<p>5.2	We undertake economic regulation, focusing on governance, financial viability and value for money. We also set consumer standards for all registered providers and in certain circumstances we may take action if these standards are breached.</p>

<p>5.3	The objectives of the regulator are set out in legislation. We have two statutory fundamental objectives: an economic regulation objective and a consumer regulation objective. These are set out in section 92K of the Act. We have also set these out below.</p>

<p>5.4	The economic regulation objective is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that registered providers of social housing are financially viable and properly managed, and perform their functions efficiently and economically</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to support the provision of social housing sufficient to meet reasonable demands (including by encouraging and promoting private investment in social housing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that value for money is obtained from public investment in social housing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that an unreasonable burden is not imposed (directly or indirectly) on public funds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to guard against the misuse of public funds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5.5	The consumer regulation objective is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to support the provision of social housing that is well-managed and of appropriate quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that actual or potential tenants of social housing have an appropriate degree of choice and protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that tenants of social housing have the opportunity to be involved in its management and to hold their landlords to account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to encourage registered providers of social housing to contribute to the environmental, social and economic well-being of the areas in which the housing is situated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5.6	We have a statutory duty to exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference, and (so far as is possible) is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable.</p>

<p>5.7	Mindful of our duty to minimise interference and our commitment to proportionate regulation, we take a co-regulatory, risk-based approach.</p>

<p>5.8	Further information about the regulator can be found on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/regulator-of-social-housing/about">website</a>, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-the-standards">Regulating the Standards</a>, in which we set out the broad principles which underpin our regulatory approach.</p>

<h2>Background to the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>5.9 On 17 November 2020 the Government published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">The Charter for Social Housing Residents: Social Housing White Paper</a> (the White Paper). In the White Paper, the Government sets out a commitment to strengthen the regulator’s consumer regulation role to enable us to proactively monitor registered providers’ compliance with a set of revised consumer standards. Legislation to enable this to happen is expected to come forward in due course.</p>

<p>5.10	One of the expectations set out in the White Paper is that the regulator will bring in a set of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for all registered providers. While legislation is required to implement our enhanced consumer regulation role, we are bringing forward our work to introduce a set of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, in advance of developing our enhanced consumer regulation role. We think that it is right that we prepare for the introduction of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> at this point, partly to reflect the time registered providers would need to prepare for the collection of the required performance information.</p>

<p>5.11	The White Paper states that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should include both objective quantitative measures and tenant perception measures and follow the themes set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/social-housing-green-paper-a-new-deal-for-social-housing">Social Housing Green Paper</a>, which are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keeping properties in good repair</li>
  <li>Maintaining building safety</li>
  <li>Effective handling of complaints</li>
  <li>Respectful and helpful engagement</li>
  <li>Responsible neighbourhood management, including measures on anti-social behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.12	The White Paper emphasises the importance of careful design of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, in order to achieve clarity and comparability, and has tasked the regulator with undertaking further work to deliver this.</p>

<p>5.13	The White Paper expects <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to have two aims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide tenants with greater transparency about their landlord’s performance</li>
  <li>to inform the regulator about how a registered provider is complying with the consumer standards under a proactive consumer regulation regime.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.14	In developing our proposals, we have sought to achieve these aims, as well as other aims and principles which we have summarised in Chapter 6.</p>

<p>5.15	To test some elements of our proposals, as we developed them, we have worked with the members of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Sounding Board <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, and other stakeholders including tenants. Their input has helped us to identify a number of key areas, including in relation to the survey methodology and question design which we are seeking views on in this consultation.</p>

<p>5.16	In preparing Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3), we have also drawn on advice commissioned from BMG Research. We would like to thank everyone for their input.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Key principles</h2>

<p>6.1 In developing our proposals, we have carefully considered a number of principles which we think are important to designing <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> and related requirements. We will continue to be mindful of these principles in considering the responses to this consultation, and in deciding if and how to change any of the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> and related documents in the light of those responses.</p>

<p>6.2 In this chapter we have summarised the main principles referred to in the previous paragraph. We have also summarised a number of key overarching statutory duties on the regulator relevant to our proposals. For ease, in this document we refer to these principles and statutory duties together as ‘key principles’.</p>

<p>6.3 It may be helpful for consultees to consider these key principles when thinking about and responding to the proposals in this consultation.</p>

<p>6.4 Key overarching statutory duties that are relevant to our proposals, and which we must meet as the regulator, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we must perform our functions with a view to achieving (so far as is possible) our two statutory fundamental objectives: the economic regulation objective and the consumer regulation objective. These are set out in section 92K of the Act and in Chapter 5 of this document,</li>
  <li>we must exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference, and (so far as is possible) is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable (section 92K(5) of the Act),</li>
  <li>in setting consumer standards, we must have regard to the desirability of registered providers being free to choose how to provide services and conduct business (section 193(3) of the Act),</li>
  <li>our public sector equality duty, which is summarised in Chapter 3 of this document.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.5 As a regulator, we operate within the provisions of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Government’s Regulators’ Code</a> and have due regard to it when developing policies and procedures that guide our regulatory activities. This includes in relation to proposals set out in this consultation.</p>

<h2>Our regulatory approach</h2>

<p>6.6 Broad principles which underpin our regulatory approach are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-the-standards">‘Regulating the Standards’</a>.</p>

<p>6.7 Our approach is outcome-focussed, co-regulatory, proportionate, risk-based and assurance based. These principles will continue to be central to our regulatory approach following the implementation of our strengthened consumer regulatory role.</p>

<p>6.8 As also explained in Chapter 5, the Government plans to legislate to implement our strengthened consumer regulation role. We expect to develop other elements of our approach to our enhanced consumer regulation role in due course. We intend that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data will be one source of assurance alongside a number of other sources, and we do not intend to use <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data in isolation to enforce compliance with the consumer standards. As part of our work to develop our enhanced consumer regulation role, we have recently published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reshaping-consumer-regulation-our-principles-and-approach">Reshaping consumer regulation: our principles and approach</a> to provide further context.</p>

<p>6.9	The <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are not intended to cover all aspects of a registered provider’s performance.</p>

<p>6.10	The <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, and related requirements, would apply along with our other standards and requirements. This includes paragraph 2.2.1c of the Tenant Involvement and Empowerment Standard, which currently requires registered providers to provide timely and relevant performance information to support effective scrutiny by tenants of their performance in a form which they seek to agree with their tenants. The existing consumer standards will continue to apply until the regulator amends them or replaces them with any new standards.</p>

<h2>Our three tests for the new consumer regulation regime</h2>

<p>6.11	Following publication of the White Paper, we set three tests for the implementation of the new consumer regulation regime. We consider that the changes introduced should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a meaningful difference to tenants</li>
  <li>be deliverable by registered providers</li>
  <li>be capable of being regulated by the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles we have developed for <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>6.12	We have also developed a set of more specific principles that have helped to shape the design of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>:</p>

<h3>Link to statutory objectives</h3>

<p>There should be a clear link between <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> and our statutory objectives; the data we require registered providers to submit to us should support us in meeting those objectives</p>

<h3>Relevant</h3>

<p><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should meet the dual aims set out in the White Paper where possible. These aims are that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should provide tenants with greater transparency about their landlord’s performance and inform the regulator about how a registered provider is complying with the consumer standards</p>

<h3>Accurate</h3>

<p><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should ensure comparability of performance so far as is possible, limit the scope for gaming, be well defined and verifiable</p>

<h3>Responsive</h3>

<p><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should measure performance which is attributable to the registered provider. They should also be timely and avoid perverse incentives. We want to avoid, as far as is possible, creating measures that could encourage registered providers to act in a way that would improve their ‘score’ but may worsen underlying outcomes for tenants.</p>

<h3>Deliverable</h3>

<p><abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should be cost effective for both the regulator and registered providers, and reasonably straightforward to collect. We recognise that there are a range of different practices within the sector for collecting and measuring performance information and, where reasonably possible, we want <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to avoid requiring disproportionately complex changes to registered providers’ systems and processes. However, a need for registered providers to make some changes to their systems and processes is likely to be unavoidable or may simply be appropriate.</p>

<p>6.13	We recognise that a number of the above aims and principles may compete with each other. We expect that some <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, or certain aspects of our related requirements, may achieve some aims better than others, but we consider that they are all important. Our intention is to strike an appropriate balance between these competing aims.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> The proposed Tenant Satisfaction Measures Standard</h2>

<h2>Proposed introduction of a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard</h2>

<p>7.1 Under section 193 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, we can set consumer standards for registered providers. These are about the nature, extent and quality of accommodation, facilities or services provided by registered providers connected with social housing, as further detailed in section 193 of the Act.</p>

<p>7.2 We may act if these standards are breached <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. This is subject to our statutory duties, such as our duty to exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference, and (so far as is possible) is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable.</p>

<p>7.3 To incorporate <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> into our regulatory framework, and to set clear expectations of registered providers, we propose to introduce a new consumer standard which would require registered providers to, among other things, collect, publish and submit information about their performance against published <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in accordance with requirements set out by the regulator. This is the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard.</p>

<p>7.4 The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard would apply to all registered providers. This would include both local authority registered providers and private registered providers of all sizes. This also means that it would apply equally to both non-profit and profit-making private registered providers.</p>

<p>7.5 In considering the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, it is important to bear in mind that we are proposing to implement this new standard in advance of the wider regulatory regime changes to bring about our enhanced consumer regulation role.</p>

<p>7.6 Following legislative change, we intend to review all our consumer standards, which would include the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard introduced following this consultation.</p>

<p>7.7 All our existing consumer standards will continue to apply until we amend them or replace them with any new standards. As also explained in paragraph 6.10, the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard would apply in addition to the regulator’s other standards and would not in any way amend or replace them. This means that registered providers would need to ensure that they meet the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, while also ensuring that they meet all other standards.</p>

<h2>Proposed content of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard</h2>

<p>7.8	The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard is at Annex 1. We think that this standard sets clear expectations which would support the regulator in helping to ensure that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> meet their aims as set out in the White Paper. We have set out below the required outcome and specific expectations in the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, and we have summarised our rationale.</p>

      <td>Registered providers must collect and provide information to support effective scrutiny by tenants of their landlord’s performance in managing their homes and neighbourhoods</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>7.9 We think that this required outcome reflects an underlying principle in the White Paper that providers should help tenants to understand how their landlord is performing so that they are able to hold them to account.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>7.10	We consider that our proposed detailed requirements in relation to <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, which all registered providers would have to meet, would be critical to help ensure the collection, publication and reporting of good quality data, which is as comparable, accessible and reliable as is reasonably possible.</p>

<p>7.11	In view of this, we think it is important to make clear that in order to comply with the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard, registered providers would need to meet the more detailed requirements set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements and Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. We are also consulting on drafts of these documents, which are discussed further in Chapters 9 and 10.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.2</td>
      <td>Registered providers must: <br> <br> a. collect information specified by the regulator relating to their performance against the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. The information must be collected within a timeframe set by the regulator and must meet the regulator’s requirements in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements and Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. <br> <br> b. annually publish their performance against the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. This should include information about how they have met the regulator’s requirements set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements and Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. This information must be published in a manner that is timely, clear and easily accessed by tenants. <br> <br> c. annually submit to the regulator information specified by the regulator relating to their performance against those measures. The information must be submitted within a timeframe and in a form determined by the regulator.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>7.12	To deliver the aims of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> we think it is essential that all registered providers be required to meet the requirements of the regulator as to what information to collect in relation to their performance against <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, and when to collect it. Paragraph 2.2.a would make this a clear expectation of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard and would emphasise that the information collected would need to meet our requirements as set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements and in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements.</p>

<p>7.13	In relation to 2.2.b we consider that expecting all registered providers to publish their performance against <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually would be an important aspect of achieving the expectations of the White Paper, in order that registered providers are transparent to tenants about their performance. Registered providers would be able to publish their <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> performance more frequently if they wish to do so, or if they agree more frequent publication with their tenants.</p>

<p>7.14	We consider the expectation in 2.2.b for registered providers to publish information about how they have met the regulator’s requirements would be important to provide tenants with confidence that their landlord is meeting these requirements, and also transparency in relation to how they are doing so.</p>

<p>7.15	To help ensure that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would also serve as a regulatory tool, we think it is important that registered providers be expected to meet requirements we specify in relation to what information they submit to us about their performance against <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, including when to submit the information, and in what form to report it. Paragraph 2.2.c sets out this expectation and that the submissions would need to be made annually. This is also important because it would enable the regulator to publish consolidated <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> performance information and would therefore support tenants in comparing <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> performance.</p>

<p>7.16	We propose that our requirements regarding the annual submission of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator for the purposes of paragraph 2.2.c would be specified through the issuing of a data submission form which registered providers would be required to complete and submit to us. We intend to develop a submission form following the conclusion of this consultation, and in good time before providers would be required to submit their data to us for the first year.</p>

<p>7.17	To deliver the aims of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, it is important that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information collected, published and submitted by registered providers is robust. Through the work we carried out with stakeholders to help inform our proposals, we heard concerns about the risk of gaming associated with performance measures, which could make <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data unreliable and difficult to compare, whether between different registered providers or for the same registered provider year on year. Paragraph 2.3 of the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard would place explicit expectations on all registered providers with respect to the accuracy, reliability and validity of their data to help mitigate this risk. We acknowledge that this risk cannot be entirely removed from any performance management regime, however, we think the expectations in paragraph 2.3, together with the requirements in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements and in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements would be important for mitigating this risk so far as is reasonably possible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> The <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> proposed by the regulator</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>8.1 The White Paper sets out themes around which <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should be developed. These themes are Keeping properties in good repair, Maintaining building safety, Effective handling of complaints, Respectful and helpful engagement, and Responsible neighbourhood management, including anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>8.2 The White Paper also states that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should include both objective quantitative measures and tenant perception measures, and sets out a draft set of 23 <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, which follow the themes referred to above. For reference, the White Paper’s draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are set out in Annex 5 of this document.</p>

<p>8.3 The White Paper is clear that the Government expects social housing landlords to give their tenants access to a set of clear and comparable measures to enable them to understand their landlord’s performance and has tasked the regulator with undertaking further work to deliver this.</p>

<p>8.4 We have taken the themes and issues in the White Paper as our starting point for developing a set of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> we, as the regulator, are proposing to set, which aim to reflect the principles set out in Chapter 6 of this document.</p>

<p>8.5 We are proposing to introduce 22 <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. These reflect the themes and issues set out in the White Paper. There are 12 tenant perception measures which are to be collected through tenant perception surveys. A perception survey aims to periodically capture tenants’ general views of landlord performance and is not triggered by a recent interaction with the landlord. Providers would be required not to use data from transactional surveys to calculate these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. There are also 10 <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> which are to be collected from providers’ management information. The 22 <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that we are proposing to introduce are outlined in this chapter and the full definitions are set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements and in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. The <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> areas are also summarised in Table 2 below.</p>

<p>8.6	In order to distinguish the different types of draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we have categorised them as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tenant perception measures, which have the prefix TP (TP01-TP12)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures based on registered providers’ management information, which we have given the following prefixes to:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RP for the repairs and stock quality <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> (RP01-RP02)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BS for the maintaining building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> (BS01-BS05)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CH for the effective handling of complaints <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> (CH01-CH02)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NM for the responsible neighbourhood management <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> (NM01).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8.7	We are mindful that for two of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in the White Paper, Government policy is currently under review and may be subject to change.</p>

<p>i. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities plans to consult on electrical safety in the social rented sector and has set up a Working Group to help inform that consultation. This work is underway but has not yet concluded. We will therefore decide on the most appropriate action to take in relation to introducing a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> on electrical safety once this work is concluded.</p>

<p>ii. The Government is also leading a review of the Decent Homes Standard to consider if it should be updated, including consideration of what the Standard might say about communal areas and green spaces. We consider that the introduction of a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> on communal areas meeting a required standard would be more practicable once the detail about any revised standard has been developed as part of the Government’s review. We will therefore decide on the most appropriate action to take in relation to introducing a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> on communal areas meeting a required standard once this review is concluded.</p>

<p>8.8	Any proposals to introduce <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in these two areas would be subject to a future consultation.</p>

<h2>Rationale for the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>8.9	In Chapter 6 of this document, we have summarised key principles that we have carefully considered in designing our proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. This chapter presents in further detail our rationale for the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> under each theme, and some of the key factors that we have considered in developing these propositions. Given the number of proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we have not presented a detailed rationale, or asked a specific question, for every individual <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> proposed in this consultation document. We have focussed on those <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that we believe present the most complex issues, where we are proposing a lead option and a specific alternative, or where the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> is materially different from the corresponding draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> proposed in the White Paper (Annex 5).</p>

<p>8.10	While the rationale in this chapter focuses on specific <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we also wish to hear views on our proposals in the round. Therefore, in addition to questions on specific <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we are seeking general views on the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> proposed for each theme, and on the overall scope of the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> suite (question 12). We would be grateful for views on both whether the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in the round meet the aims for <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> set out in the White Paper, in a proportionate way, and on the definitions of individual <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> and requirements for how they should be calculated.</p>

<p>8.11	The full definitions of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> and proposed detailed requirements for how they would need to be collected and calculated are set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2) and in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3).</p>

<h3>Commentary:</h3>

<h4>RP02 – Repairs completed within target timescales</h4>

<p>8.12	Repairs are central to the service that social housing landlords provide and a principal theme of the White Paper. Responsive repairs in particular are the main interaction between many tenants and their landlord. In order that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> capture sufficiently rounded information on repairs, we think it is important that they reflect both management information as well as tenant perceptions for this key service area.</p>

<p>8.13	On balance, we consider (non-emergency) responsive repairs completed within the provider’s target timescales to be the most appropriate management information measure that meets the aims of the White Paper. Timeliness of repairs is a key issue that matters to tenants, and for both the regulator and tenants it is important to understand where performance falls short of providers’ own standards. This is a principle reflected across the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.14	We have carefully considered a range of alternative management information measures, including responsive repairs completed ‘right first time’, repairs appointments kept, or average days’ completion time. In discussions to date, stakeholders have flagged the challenges in consistently defining and measuring ‘right first time’ across providers. Compared to these alternatives, we judge that the proposal represents a transparent, robust, and comparable measure that meets the aims of the White Paper.</p>

<p>8.15	As part of the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr>, each provider would be required to publish their target timescales for completing non-emergency responsive repairs. For some providers this may include more than one target timescale, for example for urgent and other non-emergency repairs <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. While many providers already record repairs performance against target timescales, we recognise that providers currently take a range of approaches to reporting repairs performance and a minority may not have established target timescales. In these cases, we do not think it is disproportionate to require a target to be established for the purposes of transparently communicating repairs performance.</p>

<h4>TP02 – Satisfaction with repairs</h4>

<p>8.16	We propose that landlords must collect data on tenant satisfaction with their repairs service through a perception survey, rather than transactional surveys triggered following the completion of a repair, in order to generate data for this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr>. Evidence strongly suggests that the use of transactional rather than perception surveys has a significant impact on satisfaction scores and permitting a mix of approaches is likely to significantly limit comparability across providers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>. The vast majority of tenant households are likely to have had at least one responsive repair in the last 12 months and hence would be in a position to respond to this perception survey question <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>8.17	We recognise that basing satisfaction with repairs on a perception survey may represent a departure for some providers who currently use transactional surveys to generate this information. However, given that all providers are required to conduct a perception survey to generate other <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we judge that incorporating repairs questions into this survey would not create significant additional burden. Further, the perception surveys would be subject to a single consistent set of requirements to ensure comparability of tenant perception measures across landlords <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>. Providers would not be prevented from using transactional surveys for repairs, for example as an operational or contract management tool.</p>

<h4>TP03 – Satisfaction with time taken to complete last repair</h4>

<p>8.18	Given that responsive repairs are the main interaction between many tenants and their landlord, we think there is merit in ensuring that tenant perception measures offer a sufficiently rounded view of performance in this service area. Timeliness of repairs is a key issue that matters to tenants, and this measure will enable management information on the timeliness of responsive repairs (RP02) to be cross-referenced against tenant perceptions on the same issue.</p>

<p>8.19	We have carefully considered a range of alternative question wording (e.g., satisfaction with the repair being completed ‘right first time’, quality of the repair or the ease of arranging the repair). Compared to these alternatives, we think that the proposed measure is clear, well-understood, and reflects a broad but distinct set of issues on responsive repairs that matter to tenants. Overall, this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> would offer a more rounded view of repairs than overall satisfaction with a repairs service alone (TP02).</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<h3>
<abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> BS01- BS05</h3>

<p>8.20	The White Paper underlines building safety as a paramount concern for residents and sets the ambitions of both raising safety standards and supporting residents to feel safe in their homes. It outlines a set of draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> relating to compliance with gas, fire, electrical, asbestos, water and lift safety obligations which are intended to support these ambitions.</p>

<p>8.21	Working with stakeholders, we have carefully considered how the building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> (BS01-BS05) should be defined to meet the aims of the White Paper. We propose that these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> will measure the number of individual homes for which all relevant safety checks have been completed, as a proportion of all homes which required the specified safety checks (in each case in relation to the home itself and/or in relation to any communal or other relevant parts which required the specified safety check). For example, if a required fire risk assessment (FRA) on a block of 100 flats is outstanding, then the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> would reflect that these 100 homes did not have all required FRAs in place.</p>

<p>8.22	This approach means that each building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> would be measured by reference to number of homes, but would also capture (in a single measure) specified safety checks that relate to communal or other relevant parts of buildings that the registered provider’s homes are in. Under our proposal this would include where the statutory obligation for carrying out such checks lies with a third party. An example of this might be where the registered provider’s homes are within a building owned by a third-party landlord. We recognise that, in these circumstances registered providers can experience difficulties in obtaining evidence from the third party or otherwise to demonstrate that the specified checks have been carried out. However, the importance of registered providers ensuring that these checks have been carried out is clear, and we consider that our proposed approach is consistent with the aims of the White Paper, which emphasises the role of registered providers in supporting their tenants to feel safe.</p>

<p>8.23	We have carefully considered alternative measurement approaches for these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. We are aware that legal obligations for completing health and safety checks can be complex and that providers currently take a range of approaches to reporting information on compliance. For example, we recognise that checks such as FRAs apply to communal or other relevant parts of blocks rather than individual homes. However, we do not think that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> based on the number of checks, communal parts, or communal blocks for example would offer transparency, consistency or the most meaningful sense of scale for both tenants and the regulator. A single safety check could affect a single home, or a large number of homes. We recognise that there could be an extra cost for some providers to report on the required basis, but overall, we judge this would be proportionate to delivering the aims of the White Paper.</p>

<p>8.24	We believe that we have defined the building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to align with legal requirements and sector practice as far as is reasonably possible, while meeting the aims of the White Paper. For example, the proposed requirements clarify how relevant checks required on communal blocks should be reflected in the relevant <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.25	Broadly speaking, the proposed building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> require providers to report on whether statutory safety checks have been completed in each area. We recognise that statutory health and safety obligations obviously extend beyond safety checks and include, for example, addressing remedial actions needed to maintain homes at required standards. We have carefully considered this issue and on balance we think seeking to incorporate remedial actions into <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> BS01 – BS05 would be likely to increase complexity and reduce transparency. In particular, obligations relating to remedial actions can be complex and the reporting approach – for example on prioritisation of actions – varies widely across providers.</p>

<p>8.26	The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> BS01 – BS05 aim to provide a baseline level of assurance that required safety checks have been completed. This is a necessary foundation for a robust approach to building safety compliance. These <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would not change the requirement for registered providers to comply with all health and safety obligations and to inform the regulator of any significant health and safety compliance issues (including any relating to outstanding remedial actions) in real time.</p>

<p>8.27	For the reason given in paragraph 8.7 we are not proposing to introduce a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> relating to electrical safety as part of this consultation.</p>

<h4>TP04 – Satisfaction that the home is well maintained and safe to live in</h4>

<p>8.28	The White Paper sets out the expectation that tenants should feel safe in their home and sets out a draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> measuring tenant satisfaction of this issue. We have carefully considered the precise wording of this proposed measure. The intention of this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> is to understand tenants’ perceptions of the landlord’s maintenance and physical safety of the building they live in. In the proposed survey question for this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr>, we have included the framing statement ‘thinking specifically about the building you live in’ to help focus attention on the physical safety of the building itself rather than wider issues of neighbourhood safety. We have drafted the question so it does not use terms such as ‘health and safety’ which may not be clearly or consistently understood.</p>

<p>8.29	The White Paper highlights prompt and effective complaints handling as a key issue that matters to tenants and the role of the Complaint Handling Code in promoting consistency across landlords’ complaints procedures.</p>

<p>8.30	Reflecting the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in the White Paper, the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> include headline data on the numbers of complaints and the proportion of complaints responded to within target timelines. The definitions of these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> – including the definition of complaint, the two complaint stages, and target timescales for each stage – are aligned with those in the Complaint Handling Code published by the Housing Ombudsman Service. This is intended to minimise the burden on landlords and provide greater clarity and consistency. Headline complaints data would be reported separately for stage one and stage two complaint. This would help to provide a rounded picture of complaints performance including the extent to which stage one complaints are resolved without being escalated to stage two by the tenant.</p>

<p>8.31	We recognise that the total number of complaints in isolation is not necessarily always an indicator of poor landlord performance, especially if higher complaints are the result of a more accessible and transparent complaints process. Providers would also need to ensure that they meet all of the regulator’s expectations on complaints handling, as set out in the Tenant Involvement and Empowerment Standard. However, understanding the number of complaints is fundamental to getting a rounded picture of a landlord’s complaints procedures and performance.</p>

<p>8.32	Given the importance of effective complaints handling to tenants, and following the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in the White Paper, the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> include tenant satisfaction with landlord complaints handling.</p>

<p>8.33	The regulator has carefully considered exactly how this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> should be calculated to best meet the aims of the White Paper. We propose that this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> must be generated from tenant perception survey responses. This means that all tenants included in the tenant perception survey would be asked how satisfied they are with their landlord’s handling of complaints. The main potential drawback of this approach is that relatively few potential respondents will have recent experience of being through their landlords’ formal complaints process <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>.  However, many tenants will have a valid view on this question <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> – for example, many tenants may have expressed some level of dissatisfaction to their landlord, but for a number of reasons, this may not have been registered as a formal complaint by their landlord <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>8.34	Fundamentally, an approach that gives these tenants an opportunity to voice their perspectives would, in the regulator’s view, align with the broad aims set out in the White Paper. On an important technical point, a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> based on a tenant perception survey is more likely to meet minimum levels of statistical accuracy – and other methodological requirements – necessary for valid comparison across landlords.</p>

<p>8.35	We have carefully considered the alternative option of basing this measure on transaction survey responses. This would mean providers survey tenants who have recently been through a formal complaints process. This is common practice in the sector, and has the advantage that respondents have direct recent experience to draw on in answering the question. While this may be a valid approach to managing performance, it has some significant weaknesses in terms of providing the basis for a comparable measure across providers. Given only a small minority of tenants make a formal complaint each year, and only a proportion of those complainants reply to a transactional survey, for most providers, such a measure would not meet minimum standards of statistical accuracy to enable comparability <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>TP12 – Tenant knowledge of how to make a complaint</h4>

<p>8.36	We propose to introduce an additional tenant perception measure which asks about a tenant’s knowledge of how to make a complaint to their landlord if they are not happy with the service they receive. Ensuring landlords clearly and effectively communicate how to complain is an explicit expectation set out in the White Paper.</p>

<p>8.37	The Tenant Involvement and Empowerment Standard sets out our expectations of registered providers in relation to complaints and the Housing Ombudsman sets out its requirements of member landlords in relation to complaints in their Complaint Handling Code. Stakeholders have highlighted that the total number of complaints recorded can be influenced by the accessibility and transparency of a landlord’s complaints process. As well as directly reflecting landlords’ communication about how to complain, this measure would provide important context to understand wider complaints <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.38	We have carefully considered alternative question wording (e.g., seeking tenant views on the landlords’ communication of complaints, or on the perceived ease of making complaints). We consider the proposed wording the most appropriate ‘plain English’ option that reflects the aims of the White Paper and the Complaint Handling Code.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<h4>TP05 – Satisfaction that the landlord listens to tenant views and acts upon them</h4>

<p>8.39	Ensuring that tenant views are listened to by landlords is a key aim of the White Paper, and this proposed perception question takes the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> in the White Paper as a starting point. We propose to use the wording acted upon’ rather than ‘takes notice’ in this question. Both tenants and landlords we have engaged with said they felt that it is important to capture a sense of whether the landlord actively acts on feedback, as opposed to the more passive ‘takes notice of’, which implies that a landlord may not necessarily do anything in response.</p>

<h4>TP06 – Satisfaction that the landlord keeps tenants informed about things that matter to them</h4>

<p>8.40	The White Paper underlines the importance of effective landlord engagement with tenants. It also recognises that this engagement can take many forms. This proposed question aims to reflect the aims of the White Paper, be appropriate for a tenant perception survey, and sit logically with the other proposed perception questions. Our proposed question wording seeks to ensure a clear distinction between measures by having one question about how the landlord listens to and acts on feedback from tenants (TP05) and this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> which is about the quality of communication from the landlord to its tenants. Overall, we think that this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> should work well in combination with TP05 to give a rounded view of overall satisfaction with the landlord’s general communication and engagement with tenants.</p>

<p>8.41	We have carefully considered alternative question wording. Feedback from stakeholders to date is that the term ‘engagement’ is not clear and can mean different things to different people. We recognise that the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> does not reflect more intensive forms of engagement, for example the involvement of tenant oversight of their landlord’s policies or decision making. However, because typically only a small minority of tenants choose to work with their landlord in this way, we judge that a tenant perception survey is not the most appropriate tool to understand this type of tenant engagement.</p>

<h4>TP07 – Agreement that the landlord treats tenants fairly and with respect</h4>

<p>8.42	The White Paper underlines the expectations that landlords treat tenants fairly and with respect. The proposed perception question would allow all surveyed tenants to give their view on whether they are treated with fairness and respect by their landlord.</p>

<p>8.43	We have carefully considered alternative approaches to capturing tenant perspectives on fairness and respect. Stakeholders have flagged problems of seeking to record the number of complaints relating to fairness and respect. Given these are highly subjective concepts, it is likely to be challenging to ensure such complaints are sufficiently well defined and recorded consistently by providers. Fundamentally, we think that it is more consistent with the aims of the White Paper that tenants are given the opportunity to give their own perspectives on these issues.</p>

<p>8.44	We recognise that the proposed wording combines the slightly different concepts of fairness and respect in the same question. However, the question is seeking to capture tenant views about the way they are treated by their landlord and – given that there is likely to be a high degree of correlation between views on ‘fairness’ and ‘respect’– we do not consider that it would be proportionate to create two <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to measure these concepts separately.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<h4>NM01 Anti-social behaviour cases relative to the size of the landlord</h4>

<p>8.45	The White Paper highlights <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> as a key issue affecting tenants and sets the specific aim that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> will improve transparency on how landlords are performing in this area.</p>

<p>8.46	After careful consideration, we propose that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would include the numbers of new <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> cases registered by landlords (i.e., <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> cases opened by or on behalf of the provider during the reporting year). On balance we consider that this is the most appropriate measure to increase transparency over landlords’ performance alongside the tenant satisfaction with the landlord’s handling of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> (TP10).</p>

<p>8.47	We have carefully considered alternative definitions of this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr>. We have opted for a definition based on cases of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> (including cases relating to domestic abuse and/or hate crime) rather than reports of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> since this better reflects standard terminology in the sector and reduces the complexity from repeated reports of the same <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> incident. Stakeholders flagged that ‘complaints about <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>’ could suggest complaints about the provider’s handling of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> rather than incidences of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> and may cause confusion with other complaints measures.</p>

<p>8.48	We recognise that the total number of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> cases in isolation will not necessarily be a clear indicator of landlord performance. The White Paper recognises that there can be complexities over the roles of landlords and agencies involved in tackling <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>. Case numbers are likely to be driven by socio-economic factors, the accessibility of a landlord’s <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> process, as well as how effective landlords and agencies are in addressing <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> over time. However, case numbers are a fundamental component of a rounded picture of landlords’ performance in this area.</p>

<p>8.49	We are not proposing a measure on complaints relating to communal areas, as proposed in the White Paper. This is chiefly because the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> suite already contains a measure on satisfaction with communal areas (TP08), and we will decide on the most appropriate action to take in relation to introducing a management information measure on providers’ compliance with the required standard on communal areas (following completion of the Decent Homes Standard review). Further, we think that this measure would only be meaningful when considered alongside the number of communal areas a registered provider owns, which is likely to vary materially from one organisation to another depending on the nature of their stock. We think therefore that having a third measure on communal areas, based on a very small sample of tenants, is unlikely to add a material amount to our, or tenants’, understanding of performance on this issue.</p>

<h4>TP09 – Satisfaction that the landlord makes a positive contribution to neighbourhoods</h4>

<p>8.50	The White Paper sets an expectation that all tenants should have good quality neighbourhoods and proposes a draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> on tenant satisfaction with landlord contribution to their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>8.51	Stakeholder discussions to date have highlighted challenges in determining the best approach to this measure. The role of landlords in managing neighbourhoods – whether this involves maintaining communal areas, working with agencies to address <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>, or other community initiatives – can be complex, and tenants may not always be clear about the responsibilities or contribution of their landlord. Moreover, the number and density of homes a landlord owns in an area can vary widely. Some landlords may own entire housing estates, including local amenities, and so are likely to be able to exercise a strong degree of influence in those areas either directly or through their partners. Other landlords may only own a handful of homes in an area and have a more limited role.</p>

<p>8.52	Notwithstanding the issues above, our lead proposal is to ask tenants how satisfied they are with their landlord’s contribution to the neighbourhood. This has the advantage of focusing on the landlord’s specific contribution to the neighbourhood, rather than that of other parties. However, reported <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data would need to be interpreted with significant care given that satisfaction scores may be heavily influenced by the stock profile of different landlords.</p>

<p>8.53	An alternative option for this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> would be to ask tenants how satisfied they are with the quality of their neighbourhood in general. This measure is likely to be more clearly and consistently understood by tenants and would directly gauge performance against the White Paper expectation that all tenants live in good quality neighbourhoods. This option has a disadvantage that it would not make a direct link to the actions of the landlord, and hence would not meet the principle we have borne in mind in designing <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that ideally the results should be attributable to the actions of the landlord.</p>

<p>8.54	The final alternative option considered is not to include any perception measure on neighbourhoods beyond those included elsewhere in the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> suite. For example, landlords’ contribution to neighbourhood management is reflected in measures on communal areas (internal and external to buildings) and anti-social behaviour. Compared to the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in the White Paper, however, this would narrow the scope of tenants to offer their perceptions on neighbourhood management.</p>

<h4>TP10 – Satisfaction with the landlord’s approach to handling of anti-social behaviour</h4>

<p>8.55	The White Paper highlights <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> as a key issue affecting tenants, and following the draft <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in the White Paper, the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> includes a measure of tenant satisfaction with the landlord’s handling of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>8.56	We propose that this measure is generated from a perception survey question. The key advantage of this approach is that it would ensure that the measure does not solely reflect the views of a small minority of tenants who have raised a formal <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> case with their landlord. This approach means that responses would be invited from all surveyed tenants, many of whom could be expected to have a view about their landlord’s approach to <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>. Tenants who genuinely have no view would be able to answer ‘don’t know/ not applicable’ to this question. Compared to alternatives, the proposed approach should be more likely to meet minimum standards of statistical accuracy necessary for comparability. However, the drawback is that many respondents may lack direct recent experience of their landlord’s approach to handling <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> and responses may be coloured by more general perceptions on <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.57	We have carefully considered the alternative option of basing this measure on a transactional survey question. This would only capture the views of those tenants who have registered a formal <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> case with their landlord. This has the advantage that these tenants would have first-hand knowledge of their landlord’s approach to <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>. However, for most providers small numbers of <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> cases each year mean that this measure would not meet minimum standards of statistical accuracy to enable reliable comparison across providers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>. Stakeholders raised concerns about measures that depend on a ‘gatekeeper’ role for landlords. This option would exclude the views of a wider group of tenants who have not registered a formal <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr> case but nevertheless may have legitimate views about their landlord’s approach to <abbr title="anti-social behaviour">ASB</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Overall scope of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>8.58	As well as developing <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that are individually robust, clear and comparable we want to ensure that the suite of measures is proportionate and works effectively as a whole. The proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> aim to provide a sufficiently rounded view of landlord performance, across the themes set out in the White Paper, for tenants to use to hold their landlord to account and for us to use in our consumer regulation. At the same time, we have been mindful that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should be deliverable.</p>

<p>8.59	A particular consideration has been the number and scope <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> we require landlords to collect through a survey. The range of proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> reflects the themes set out in the White Paper and the expectation that tenants are given opportunity to voice their perspectives on issues that matter to them. For many of these issues, tenant perception surveys are likely to be the only viable method to generate robust data. We are conscious, however, that a more extensive set of survey questions can risk survey fatigue among respondents, reduce response rates, and make some survey formats more difficult to deliver - this would be a risk for providers to manage as they seek to incorporate the proposed questions into wider surveys. Overall, we judge that the scope of the proposed tenant perception measures is proportionate to the aims of the White Paper. However, this is a particular issue on which we would welcome views from tenants, landlords and other stakeholders</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> General <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> requirements</h2>

<p>9.1	Below is a summary of our proposed general technical requirements which all providers would need to meet when generating data for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. These can be found in full in section 1 of Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2).</p>

<h2>Level of reporting</h2>

<p>9.2	All registered providers that own relevant social housing homes would be required to collect information and report on the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements, subject to tenant confidentiality considerations. For the purposes of reporting <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, a provider owns a home when it: (a) holds the freehold title or a leasehold interest in that home; and (b) is the body with a direct legal relationship with the occupants of the home (this body is often described as the landlord).</p>

<p>9.3	We propose that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would  be reported on a registered group basis. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Registered group parents would report their consolidated <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data for the group, which would include all relevant stock owned by all subsidiary registered providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registered group parents would not be required to report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> separately for each individual registered provider within their group. Neither would those individual registered providers be required to report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for themselves separately (in addition to consolidated <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data for their group)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registered provider that is a member of a group structure, whose parent company is not a registered provider, and which does not have a subsidiary that is a registered provider, would  report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in respect of itself only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registered provider not in a group structure would report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for their own organisation only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>9.4	This would be consistent with our approach to regulation which is at the group level. In addition, requiring <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data to be reported at an individual registered provider level would require a higher sample size to achieve statistical significance for tenant surveys. This is likely to make data at this level less reliable than group level data for a number of registered providers as well as it being more costly.</p>

<p>9.5	We recognise that tenants may wish to see <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data reported at levels other than the group level e.g., at a local authority or neighbourhood level. The proposals do not prevent registered providers also providing tenants with <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data at a level that is appropriate to the needs of their organisation and their tenants.</p>

<h2>Relevant homes</h2>

<p>9.6	In designing the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we have considered which homes the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would apply to. Our proposal is that data for the proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> contained in this document would have to be collected for the following property types (where relevant):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Low cost rental accommodation. This includes for example general needs, supported housing, intermediate rent and temporary social housing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low cost home ownership (<abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr>). This includes, for example, shared ownership homes (which have not been fully staircased)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definition of <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> and <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes is given in the Act.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>9.7	Many of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are defined in terms of numbers of dwelling units owned by provider. For the purposes of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, each of the following is a single dwelling unit</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-contained residential homes; plus</li>
  <li>bed spaces in a non-self-contained property.</li>
</ul>

<p>9.8	We are proposing that the following property types must not be included in registered providers’ <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data collection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Non-social homes e.g., market rent homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legacy social housing which is social housing only by virtue of legacy provisions in the Act <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leasehold homes including 100% owned <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes where the resident has fully staircased <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>9.9	We propose that providers would have to report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data based on the relevant homes they own. Relevant homes would not be included in the reporting of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data by more than one registered provider. Relevant homes owned by one registered provider but managed by another would be included in the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data reported by the owner.</p>

<p>9.10	Our main rationale for excluding non-social homes, such as market rent, is that they fall outside of the scope of our regulatory remit.</p>

<p>9.11	We also consider it appropriate to exclude any legacy social housing that otherwise would not fall within the definition of social housing (i.e. legacy social housing that is not <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> or <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> accommodation) from the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. This is stock where it is social housing only by virtue of legacy provisions in the Act. We do not consider that collecting information on this property type meets the aims of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> as set out in the White Paper, and so we think it is appropriate that this type of property would not be included within the data collected for <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The consumer standards do not apply to 100% owned <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes and therefore we do not propose that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would be applicable to these homes.</p>

<h2>Reporting dates and periods</h2>

<p>9.12	We propose that registered providers with 1,000 or more relevant homes would be required to collect information and report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually according to a reporting year that runs from 1 April to 31 March. Where we require information to be calculated as at ‘year end’, we propose that such registered providers would report information as at 31 March. We are proposing this because it is consistent with the existing approach to submission of providers’ housing stock data through the Statistical Data Return and Local Authority Data Return. It also aligns with the reporting year adopted by the majority of large providers.</p>

<p>9.13	As regulator, we are mindful of our statutory duty to be proportionate and minimise interference. We therefore propose that registered providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would be permitted to collect and report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually according to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March. For example, providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes might wish to use a reporting year for <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> which aligns with their particular financial reporting year. Similarly, where we require information to be calculated at ‘year end’ providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would be permitted to report information at a date other than 31 March. In reporting <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, such providers would have to be clear as to which reporting year <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> relate. Such providers would also be required to use the same reporting start and end dates year on year, except where there is a compelling reason not to do so (e.g., the provider adopts a new reporting year).</p>

<h2>Data protection</h2>

<p>9.14	In meeting regulatory requirements with respect to <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, registered providers would need to ensure they and any contractors are compliant with the relevant privacy and data protection legislation when processing personal data.</p>

<p>9.15	As well as being a legal duty which protects tenants, it is important that registered providers protect respondent’s confidentiality in order that respondents feel confident to give honest feedback in tenant perception surveys. This includes ensuring that identifiable individual responses are not shared internally or externally beyond those who require the information to produce the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, unless the respondents give explicit consent, and this is managed appropriately. This applies to both the conduct of the survey itself, and the publication of results.</p>

<p>9.16	Mindful of our duty to be proportionate we are aware that some providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes might face issues in protecting the anonymity of individual tenants. As a result, we propose that providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would be required to take a proportionate approach to protecting tenant confidentiality. We propose that it would be permissible for the data for at least some <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to be omitted from published information if registered providers judge this issue to be a material risk.</p>

<h2>Data accuracy</h2>

<p>9.17	It would ultimately be the responsibility of Boards of private registered providers and governing bodies of local authority registered providers to ensure that reported <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> had been calculated accurately and in accordance with regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Tenant perception survey requirements</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>10.1	Below is a summary of our proposed additional requirements that providers would be required to meet when generating data for a subset of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> which are referred to as tenant perception measures (TP01-TP12). These can be found in full in our Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements document (Annex 3).</p>

<p>10.2	The proposed requirements set out in Annex 3 aim to establish a robust basis for generating comparable tenant perception measures across providers. We think that they strike the right balance between ensuring a consistent approach to key aspects of survey methodology, while allowing sufficient flexibility for providers to meet requirements in a way that fits with wider objectives and a range of operating models.</p>

<h2>Survey type</h2>

<p>10.3	We propose that registered providers must generate data for the tenant perception measures TP01 – TP12 using data from tenant perception surveys only i.e., surveys which periodically capture tenants’ general views of landlord performance and which are not triggered by a recent interaction with the landlord. A perception survey would allow tenants to directly express their views of their landlord’s performance on a range of issues.</p>

<p>10.4	We are aware that some registered providers currently use transactional surveys to measure tenant satisfaction with a service following an interaction. Having considered transactional surveys, we believe there are complexities associated with them that risk the data being less comparable between different organisations. These include the use of differing survey collection methods, agreeing the timing for carrying out any survey after the transaction has been completed and defining when the transaction has been completed. The use of transactional surveys would also set a significant challenge for some registered providers to achieve minimum levels of statistical accuracy. This is because transactional surveys are only carried out with those tenants who have experienced a particular service (e.g., reported a repair or made a complaint) and so are very likely to be asked of a smaller number of tenants than if a sample of all tenants was being surveyed.</p>

<p>10.5	For the reasons given, it is proposed that transactional surveys would not be permitted for the calculation of these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. We understand that some registered providers find value in carrying out transactional surveys for their own information and we think it is important to make clear that they would remain free to collect in this way for their own use.</p>

<h2>Survey questions and response options</h2>

<p>10.6	We propose that registered providers would be required to use the prescribed question wording and response options for each survey question as specified in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3). We consider that consistency in question wording and response scale is necessary to be able to compare results between providers.</p>

<h2>Questionnaire structure</h2>

<p>10.7	We propose that registered providers would have to inform respondents that the survey will be used to calculate annual <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, and approximately how long the survey would take them to complete at the start of the survey.</p>

<p>10.8	In addition to the prescribed questions, registered providers would be able to include other questions in the same tenant perception survey questionnaire.</p>

<p>10.9	We propose to require that the overall satisfaction question to generate the overall satisfaction <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> must be the first question in a perception survey questionnaire used to generate <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. Questions to generate the other <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> would be required to come before any other question(s) that a registered provider chooses to include on the same topic. This means that the questions to generate these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> may appear together at the start of a survey or separately at the start of relevant sections with related questions. For example, if the survey includes a section with several questions on repairs and maintenance, the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> questions on repairs for TP02 and TP03 would have to appear before any other questions on repairs and maintenance.
 
## Relevant tenant population for the tenant perception measures</p>

<p>10.11 The regulator proposes that registered providers would be required to use the relevant tenant population as set out in Table 3 of Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements as a basis for the tenant perception measures.</p>

<p>10.12 It is proposed that a registered provider that owns 1,000 or more <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> homes would have to report tenant perception measures for <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> separately. Similarly, providers that own 1,000 or more units of <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> would have to report tenant perception measures for <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> separately. Our rationale for this is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>registered providers have different responsibilities in relation to <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes e.g., repair obligations, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence suggests that satisfaction levels are systematically different between tenants in <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> and <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes, and so allowing them to be combined is likely to significantly reduce comparability between organisations with different proportions of <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> and <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>10.13 Registered providers with fewer than 1,000 homes of <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> and fewer than 1,000 homes of <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> would be able to either calculate and report perception measures for <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> (only), <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> (only), both property types separately, or both property types combined.</p>

<p>10.14 Providers that own 1,000 or more <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> homes but fewer than 1,000 <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> homes, would only be required to report tenant perception measures for <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> (and vice versa).</p>

<h2>Survey timings</h2>

<p>10.15 We propose that the actual perception survey could take place at a single point in time, be spread out across a period of time, or be carried out on a rolling basis (e.g., quarterly or monthly). It would however have to be a single exercise, so for example the same tenant could not provide two responses in the same survey period.</p>

<p>10.16 Registered providers that own a total of 1,000 or more relevant homes (<abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> and <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr>) would be required to carry out a tenant perception survey at least annually to generate data for the tenant perception measures. This would mean that tenant perception measures for these providers could only be calculated using responses from surveys conducted within the reporting year the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> relate to.</p>

<p>10.17 Registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes, would be required to carry out a perception survey at least once every two years. Registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would be allowed to collect and report annual <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> according to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March. For example, providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would be allowed to use a reporting year for <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> which aligns with their particular financial reporting year.</p>

<p>10.18 We consider that these timeframes are reasonable and proportionate and strike a good balance. They would ensure that the data is reasonably recent and therefore meaningful, whilst not placing an unreasonable burden on registered providers, and not leading to survey fatigue among tenants.</p>

<h2>Survey collection method</h2>

<p>10.19 Registered providers would be allowed to use any collection method including face-to-face, telephone, postal, or email/online, and they would be allowed to use more than one collection method. This would help to enable registered providers to tailor their survey collection methods to meet the different needs of their tenant profile. Different survey methods have their own merits, and some can be more effective than others at increasing the participation of tenants who share different protected characteristics. We believe that excluding certain collection methods could be problematic for a number of reasons, in particular because it could result in tenants with specific communication needs finding it harder to take part in the survey. We therefore consider that it would be challenging to reach a consensus on one survey method that would meet the needs of all tenants.</p>

<p>10.20 There is evidence that potential differences in scores can be driven by different collection methods e.g., face-to-face and telephone surveys are more likely to produce higher levels of satisfaction than ‘self-completed’ methods such as paper and online surveys. To help address this issue, we propose requiring registered providers to publish a summary of the survey method(s) they have used (see publication of survey approach in paragraphs 10.26 – 10.28 below) so that tenants would be able to see this alongside the published satisfaction scores.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Sampling and representativeness</h2>

<p>10.21 We propose that registered providers would be required, as far as possible, to generate a sample size for overall satisfaction (TP01) that meets our proposed minimum level of statistical accuracy (set out in Table 4 of the Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements document (Annex 3)). This is to allow meaningful comparisons between providers and is standard practice when producing a robust sample to estimate tenant satisfaction scores.</p>

<p>10.22 The sample size refers to the total number of responses to the tenant perception survey. It is not the number of surveys issued or contacts attempted but the number of responses received.</p>

<p>10.23 It is proposed that registered providers must ensure that as far as reasonably possible the calculated satisfaction scores are representative of their tenant population. Registered providers would be expected to undertake reasonable checks for differences between the achieved sample and their tenant population in terms of characteristics associated with different average satisfaction scores and weighting (where appropriate and reasonable) in order to balance any under-representation or over-representation in the sample. We judge that requiring that responses are (so far as reasonably possible) representative of the tenant population is a standard and fundamental requirement. This is both necessary to ensure robust and comparable tenant perception measures and to ensure that the results are a fair reflection of the views of all tenants (including under-represented groups).</p>

<p>10.24 Registered providers would be expected to take reasonable steps to assess and remove barriers that may exist for specific groups of tenants participating in surveys, which should have a positive impact on equality considerations, including advancing equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>In-house or outsourced</h2>

<p>10.25 Being mindful of our duty to be proportionate, we consider it appropriate that registered providers would be able to choose to conduct tenant perception surveys and calculate the perception measures either in-house or through an external contractor. As with other regulatory data and requirements, in either case it would be the responsibility of Boards of private registered providers and governing bodies of local authority registered providers to ensure that the regulator’s requirements relating to the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are met.</p>

<h2>Publication of survey approach</h2>

<p>10.26 Registered providers would be required to publish a summary of their tenant survey methodology used to generate tenant perception survey data for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, alongside their published <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data.</p>

<p>10.27 This would include a summary of achieved sample size (number of responses), timing of survey, collection method, sample method, assessment of representativeness of the sample against the relevant tenant population, any weighting applied to generate the reported perception measures, and any other methodological issues likely to have a material impact on the tenant perception measures reported.</p>

<p>10.28 We believe that a requirement to publish the summary outlined in the paragraph above would increase transparency, as it would help tenants in particular to better understand the context of their landlord’s results and the process that they have followed to achieve the results. We think that it would also help provide Boards and governing bodies with assurance that their results are an accurate, reliable, valid, and transparent reflection of performance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Registered providers of different sizes</h2>

<p>11.1	It is proposed that registered providers that own 1,000 or more relevant homes (<abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> and <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> units combined) will be expected to meet the requirements as set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2) and in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3).</p>

<h2>Providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes</h2>

<p>11.2	In order to reflect our risk-based approach and in line with our duty to exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference and (as far as is possible) is proportionate, we propose to tailor our approach to registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes in relation to the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> proposals as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Such providers would not be required to make annual submissions of performance data for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to the regulator. We think that this would reduce the regulatory burden on those providers, while ensuring that their tenants can hold their landlord to account. Our analysis suggests that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> results from providers with fewer than 1,000 homes would not be as comparable as those of larger providers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such providers would be permitted to collect and report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually according to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March. Where we require information for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to be calculated at ‘year end,’ registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would be permitted to report information at a date which aligns with their financial reporting year. In reporting <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, such providers would have to be clear as to which reporting year <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> relate to and such providers would also be required to use the same reporting start and end dates year on year, except where there is a compelling reason not to do so (e.g., the provider adopts a new financial reporting year).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11.3	For the tenant perception measures, registered providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be able to undertake a census survey (i.e., inviting all tenants to participate) as a means of meeting our requirements in relation to sample size. This is to reflect the greater difficulty these providers are likely to face in achieving a sample size that will meet our requirements for statistical accuracy (which are consistent with conventional levels of statistical accuracy)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be permitted to undertake perception survey  less frequently than large providers. We are proposing that, for providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes, tenant perception surveys must be undertaken at least once every two years. This means that tenant perception measures for these providers must only be calculated using responses from surveys conducted within the past two reporting years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be permitted to report tenant perception measures for <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> (only), <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> (only), both property types separately, or both property types combined, where relevant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only be expected to undertake a high-level assessment of representativeness of the achieved sample and would not be expected to weigh responses unless there was clear evidence of significant bias</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be permitted to leave out data for at least some tenant perception measures from <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data that they would be required to publish if the registered provider judges it is necessary in order to protect tenant confidentiality. This is because for the smallest providers, it may be difficult to protect the anonymity of individual tenants if tenant perception information is published in full.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11.4	Notwithstanding these specific provisions, providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would still be required to comply with the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> Standard and the regulator’s requirements for calculating <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data, so the Boards and governing bodies of those providers would still need to have adequate assurance of the accuracy and validity of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data.</p>

<p>11.5 We view transparency as being of fundamental importance in a co-regulatory regime and would still require such providers to communicate with us in a timely manner on material issues that relate to non-compliance or potential non-compliance with the standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Publication of registered providers’ <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data by the regulator</h2>

<p>12.1	In the White Paper, the Government states that the regulator is expected to consider the best way of publishing <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data so that it is clear and accessible for all tenants.</p>

<p>12.2	We propose to publish <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data of providers that own 1,000 or more relevant homes on an annual basis, following a period of data validation by the regulator. We think that a key reason for the regulator to publish <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data is to support comparison of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> performance across different providers, and our analysis suggests that the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data from providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would not be as comparable as those of larger providers.</p>

<p>12.3	We are committed to seeking views, including those of tenants, about how we would publish providers’ <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> data, and we intend to seek views on this matter in due course.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Draft guidance about the submission of Tenant Satisfaction Measures information to the regulator</h2>

<p>13.1	Following the conclusion of this consultation we propose to publish, alongside the other final <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> documents, guidance about the submission of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator.</p>

<p>13.2	Publication of such guidance would meet our statutory duty under section 215(1)(a) of the Act, which requires the regulator to publish guidance about the submission of information to the regulator about the performance of registered providers. Section 215(2) of the Act provides that this guidance must, in particular, specify how the regulator will deal with the submissions it receives, and section 215(3) provides that the regulator must have regard to this guidance. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>13.3	The draft guidance about the submission of information to the regulator in relation to the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> is at Annex 4.</p>

<p>13.4	We think that the draft guidance is in keeping with the key principles set out in Chapter 6 of this document. Consistent with these principles, we consider it particularly important for the guidance to make clear that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered providers with fewer than 1,000 relevant homes would not be required to annually submit their <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator (as further explained in Chapter 11 of this document)</li>
  <li>in good time before registered providers are required to make their annual submission of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information to us, we will specify the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information they are required to submit, the form in which that information must be submitted, and by when</li>
  <li>on an annual basis, the regulator will collate <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information submitted to us by registered providers that own 1,000 or more relevant homes and publish the results (as further explained in Chapter 12 of this document)</li>
  <li>we would not generally use <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information as a source of regulatory intelligence in isolation, but rather use it as a source of information we may have regard to alongside other sources</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information could be used to help the regulator to identify particular areas where we might wish to seek further assurance from a registered provider about meeting our standards</li>
  <li>the submission of late, incomplete or inaccurate <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information may be indicative of a weak control environment. Given this, failure to provide accurate and timely <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr> information could, where appropriate, be reflected in our judgement of a registered provider’s compliance with the regulatory standards.</li>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>At present the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 limits the regulator’s powers in relation to the consumer standards, except where we think that a registered provider has failed to meet a consumer standard and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the failure has resulted in a serious detriment to tenants (or potential tenants), or there is a significant risk that, if no action is taken by the regulator, the failure will result in a serious detriment to the provider’s tenants (or potential tenants).

      <p>Transactional surveys are triggered by a recent interaction with the landlord (e.g. completion of a repair, or response to a complaint).&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:8" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>While emergency repairs are of critical importance, we judge that it would offer limited value to seek to incorporate them into this <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measure">TSM</abbr>. Standard sector practice is to separate emergency repairs from non-emergency responsive repairs since they are typically subject to distinct target timelines and processes. Emergency repairs completion rates at a point in time are typically universally close to 100% (<abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr> <abbr title="Coronavirus Operational Responses Survey">CORS</abbr> survey, 2020/21). Any material failure to promptly complete emergency repairs would represent significant risk of health and safety non-compliance, which providers would be required to report to the regulator in real time.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:9" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>For the avoidance of doubt, tenants who do not know or have no opinion will have the option of a “don’t know/ not applicable” response which will not affect the calculated satisfaction score.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:14" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The definition of a complaint in the Complaint Handling Code is ‘an expression of dissatisfaction, however made, about the standard of service, actions or lack of action by the organisation, its own staff or those acting on its behalf, affecting an individual resident or group of residents’. The White Paper highlights that many tenants experience barriers to raising a formal complaint with their landlord.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:15" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>For example, a provider with 10,000 units which registers 30 complaints/1,000 households per annum, and surveys all these complainants on closure, would typically generate a satisfaction score with a margin of error of +/- 9% (regulator’s estimates, assuming a 30% response rate). For smaller providers, margins would be considerably wider. Beyond this fundamental issue of statistical accuracy, there are likely to be a range of methodological issues that critically impact on the comparability of scores from transaction surveys (e.g. survey timing, collection method, potential exclusions of some complainants).&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:16" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

      <p>Leasehold homes in this context are those for which a leasehold interest has been sold to a resident, for example through fully staircasing a shared ownership home or repaying an equity loan on a shared equity property in full or through the Right to Buy, and which are not classed as <abbr title="low cost home ownership accommodation">LCHO</abbr> or <abbr title="low cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr>. While the provider retains some legal interest in the home (e.g. a freehold), the leasehold interest typically gives the owner the right to sell or let the home on the housing market. Many leasehold homes are non-social, but some may be social housing due to legacy provisions in the HRA 2008, section 77.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:19" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
