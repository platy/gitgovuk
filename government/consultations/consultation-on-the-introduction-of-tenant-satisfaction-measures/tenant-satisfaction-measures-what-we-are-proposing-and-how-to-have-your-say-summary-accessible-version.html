<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> About the consultation</h2>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing is creating a new system for assessing how well social housing landlords in England are doing at providing good quality homes and services. Among other things, the system will involve a set of tenant satisfaction measures that social housing landlords must report on. People will be able to use these measures to understand how well landlords are doing.</p>

<p>We are now at the point where we want to know what people think about the tenant satisfaction measures we are proposing.</p>

<p>This document summarises our proposals and tells you how to share your views on them with us. 
Another document, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">Consultation on the introduction of tenant satisfaction measures</a>, has a more detailed look at our proposals and the thinking behind them. That document is our statutory consultation document.</p>

<h2>Will this apply to me?</h2>

<p>We are proposing that the tenant satisfaction measures would cover all kinds of rented social housing in England where the landlord is registered with us (a ‘registered provider’).</p>

<p>Some, but not all, of the tenant satisfaction measures (e.g. Maintaining building safety - below) would also cover shared ownership homes.</p>

<h2>Why are these changes happening?</h2>

<p>In 2020, the government published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper#executive-summary">The charter for social housing residents – social housing white paper</a>, which sets out ways to improve things for people living in social housing. Some of these are for the Regulator of Social Housing to do.</p>

<p>Our document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reshaping-consumer-regulation-our-principles-and-approach">Reshaping consumer regulation: our principles and approach</a> describes the steps we are taking.</p>

<p>One of those steps is bringing in a set of tenant satisfaction measures.</p>

<p>These measures should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>let tenants see how well their landlord is doing give us an idea of which landlords might need to improve things for their tenants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give us an idea of which landlords might need to improve things for their tenants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The white paper says landlords should keep properties in good repair, maintain the safety of buildings, handle tenants’ complaints effectively, engage with tenants helpfully and with respect, and take a responsible role in managing their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It suggests possible tenant satisfaction measures designed to see how well landlords are meeting these expectations. It is now our job to build on these suggestions and decide how to make tenant satisfaction measures a reality.</p>

<h2>What’s happened so far with tenant satisfaction measures, and what we plan to happen next</h2>

<h2>What are we trying to achieve?</h2>

<p>Tenant satisfaction measures are intended to make landlords’ performance more visible to tenants, and help tenants hold their landlords to account.</p>

<p>The white paper stated that we need to design the measures carefully.</p>

<p>Looking at each measure on its own, it needs to be clear what it is saying about the landlord. Tenants should also be able to use it to compare landlords.</p>

<p>Looking at all the measures together, they should also work together to show how well a landlord is doing in some key areas.</p>

<p>We are interested in your opinion on whether our current proposals for the measures would achieve these goals.</p>

<h2>How will tenant satisfaction measures work?</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Flowchart showing how tenant satisfaction measures will work" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/137331/14405_RSH_TSM_Consultation_summary_infographic2-websize.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Coming up with what to measure is only one part of our work on tenant satisfaction measures.</p>

<p>We also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a standard that requires landlords to collect and publish the information needed for the measures</li>
  <li>a set of requirements that tells landlords how they should collect and publish the information, so that different landlords’ information is consistent and can be compared.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are interested in what you think about the standard and requirements we are proposing.</p>

<h3>Tenant perception surveys</h3>

<p>Surveying tenants may be the best or only way to get an idea of many of the things we are trying to measure. 
At the same time, we do not want to ask landlords to carry out surveys that are so long that tenants do not want to take part in them.</p>

<p>We are interested in your views on whether the set of tenant perception survey questions we are proposing here is right for the job.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The proposals: Our thinking</h2>

<p>We want the changes we are making to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a meaningful difference to tenants</li>
  <li>be possible for landlords to carry out</li>
  <li>be something we can regulate.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help achieve this, we think that as far as possible, all the tenant satisfaction measures should be relevant, accurate, responsive, deliverable and linked to our objectives.</p>

<p>You might find it helpful to keep these five principles in mind when thinking about our proposals and responding to the consultation.</p>

<h3>Relevant</h3>

<p>The tenant satisfaction measures should provide relevant information. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>letting tenants see how their landlord is performing</li>
  <li>telling us about how well landlords are meeting relevant standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accurate</h3>

<p>The measures should be well defined and it should be possible to double-check the results. They should make it possible to compare different landlords, and should make it difficult for landlords to make themselves look better than they really are.</p>

<h3>Responsive</h3>

<p>The measures should only measure things the landlord is actually responsible for. They should not accidentally encourage landlords to do anything that makes things worse for their tenants.</p>

<h3>Deliverable</h3>

<p>The measures should not be too expensive or complicated to put into practice, either for us or for landlords.</p>

<h3>Linked to our objectives</h3>

<p>There should be a clear link between the measures and the objectives we are trying to achieve as a regulator. The data we ask landlords to provide should help us to meet those objectives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> The proposals: The tenant satisfaction measures</h2>

<p>We are proposing 22 tenant satisfaction measures, covering five main themes. Ten of these would be measured by landlords directly, and 12 by landlords carrying out tenant perception surveys.</p>

<p>You can read the full definitions of the proposed tenant satisfaction measures in Annex 2 and Annex 3 of Consultation on the introduction of tenant satisfaction measures.</p>

<h3>TP01: Overall satisfaction - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>Taking everything into account, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the service provided by your landlord?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<h2>Keeping properties in good repair</h2>

<h3>TP02: Satisfaction with repairs - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>Has your landlord carried out a repair to your home in the last 12 months?</p>

<p>If yes, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the repairs service you have received to your home from your landlord over the last 12 months?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<h3>TP03: Satisfaction with time taken to complete most recent repair - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>Has your landlord carried out a repair to your home in the last 12 months?</p>

<p>If yes, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the time taken to complete your most recent repair after you reported it?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>We have thought about some other ways of wording this survey question, focusing on issues like the quality of the repair or how easy it was to arrange. We think the version above is clear, easy to understand, and covers the issues that matter most to tenants.</p>

<h3>RP01: Homes that do not meet the Decent Homes Standard - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of a landlord’s homes that do not meet the Decent Homes Standard. This is a government document describing conditions that social homes should meet.</p>

<h3>RP02: Repairs completed within target timescale - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of repairs the landlord has done within the target time they have set for themselves. As part of this measure, landlords would have to make these target times public.</p>

<p>It would only measure non-emergency repairs requested by tenants. Emergency repairs and repairs planned by the landlord would not be included.</p>

<p>We thought about some similar measurements that could be useful, like the average number of days to complete a repair, or the percentage of repairs appointments that take place as planned. We think the version above is transparent, robust, and makes it easy to compare different landlords.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Shared ownership homes would not be included in these four tenant satisfaction measures as repairs to these homes are the shared owner’s responsibility, not the landlord’s.</p>
</div>

<h2>Maintaining building safety</h2>

<h3>TP04: Satisfaction that the home is well maintained and safe to live in - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>Thinking specifically about the building you live in, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you that your landlord provides a home that is well maintained and safe for you to live in?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>The phrase “Thinking specifically about the building you live in” is to make sure people are thinking about things to do with their building, and not about the safety of the neighbourhood more generally.</p>

<h3>BS01: Gas safety checks - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of homes that have had all the necessary gas safety checks.</p>

<h3>BS02: Fire safety checks - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of homes in buildings that have had all the necessary fire risk assessments.</p>

<h3>BS03: Asbestos safety checks - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of homes in buildings that have had all the necessary 
asbestos management surveys or re-inspections.</p>

<h3>BS04: Water safety checks - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of homes that have had all the necessary legionella risk assessments. Legionella is a bacteria that can make people ill if it gets into water supplies.</p>

<h3>BS05: Lift safety checks - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of homes in buildings where the communal passenger lifts have had all the necessary safety checks.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Measures BS01–BS05</h4>

<p>We are proposing that these five measures should be based on the number of individual homes that are covered by relevant safety checks. Not all homes require all checks.</p>

<p>We thought about basing these measures on the number of buildings or the number of checks. But a single check could affect one household or many, so we do not think these measures would be as clear or make as much sense for tenants as the ones we are proposing.</p>

<p>Landlords’ responsibilities go beyond safety checks. For example, they must also act on the results of the checks to maintain a good standard of safety. We thought about whether to include actions like these in measures BS01–05, but we believe this would make them too complex and less clear.</p>

<h2>Respectful and helpful engagement</h2>

<h3>TP05: Satisfaction that the landlord listens to tenant views and acts upon them - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the extent to which your landlord listens to your views and acts upon them?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>It looks at one part of how landlords communicate with tenants: when the landlord is responding to a tenant. Measure TP06 looks at another part of this picture.</p>

<h3>TP06: Satisfaction that the landlord keeps tenants informed about things that matter to them - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the way your landlord keeps you informed about things that matter to you as a tenant?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>It looks at one part of how landlords communicate with tenants: when the landlord provides information. 
Measure TP05 looks at another part of this picture.</p>

<p>There are other ways landlords and tenants interact. For example, some tenants review or oversee their landlord’s decisions. Only a small number of tenants normally choose to work with their landlords like this, though, so we do not think a tenant perception survey is the right way to learn about these parts of the picture.</p>

<h3>TP07: Agreement that the landlord treats tenants fairly and with respect - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</p>

<p>“My landlord treats me fairly and with respect.”</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they “agree” or “strongly agree”.</p>

<h2>Responsible neighbourhood management</h2>

<h3>TP08: Satisfaction that the landlord keeps communal areas clean, safe and well-maintained - measured by: tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>Do you live in a building with communal areas, either inside or outside, that you share with other people who live in the building?</p>

<p>If yes, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you that your landlord keeps these communal areas clean, safe and well-maintained?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<h3>TP09: Satisfaction that the landlord makes a positive contribution to neighbourhoods - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>Thinking about what your landlord does to improve your neighbourhood as a place to live, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the extent to which your landlord makes a positive contribution to your neighbourhood?</p>

<p>We are also interested in what you think about an alternative version of this question:</p>

<p>How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your neighbourhood as a place to live?</p>

<p>Either way, this measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>Our preferred version of the question makes sure we are measuring things landlords are actually responsible for. On the other hand, tenants might not always know what their landlord does or is responsible for around their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Also, landlords that own entire estates, including local shops and other amenities, can probably make a bigger contribution to the neighbourhood than landlords that only own a few homes. This might make it more difficult to compare different landlords using this measure.</p>

<p>The alternative version of the question is easier to understand, but not everything in a tenant’s neighbourhood is the way it is because of their landlord, so it might not be the best way to measure landlords’ performance.</p>

<p>Another option is not to ask about satisfaction with neighbourhoods in the tenant perception survey. In that case, we could use other measures like TP08, TP10 and NM01 to understand how well landlords contribute to their neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>TP10: Satisfaction with the landlord’s approach to handling of anti-social behaviour  - measured by tenant perception survey</p>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your landlord’s approach to handling anti-social behaviour?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>Not every tenant will have raised a formal anti-social behaviour case with their landlord, but we still propose putting this question to everyone.</p>

<p>We could have proposed asking tenants this question after they report an anti-social behaviour case (a ‘transactional survey’). Asking the question in the tenant perception survey instead means that people who have not formally reported any anti-social behaviour can still have their say. It also avoids this measure being based on the views of a small number of people.</p>

<h3>NM01: Anti-social behaviour cases relative to the size of the landlord - measured by: landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the number of anti-social behaviour cases opened for each 1,000 homes the landlord owns. Anti-social behaviour cases would also include cases related to domestic abuse and hate crime.</p>

<p>We could have proposed basing this measure on anti-social behaviour complaints or reports. We proposed basing it on anti-social behaviour cases instead, to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Measuring reports could cause confusion when there are several reports of the same incident; cases are a clearer measure. The word “complaints” could cause confusion because in other measures like CH01–CH02 and TP11–TP12, it means complaints about the landlord, while here it would mean complaints to the landlord about anti-social behaviour.</p>

<h2>Effective handling of complaints</h2>

<h3>TP11: Satisfaction with the landlord’s approach to handling of complaints - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your landlord’s approach to complaints handling?</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they are “fairly satisfied” or “very satisfied”.</p>

<p>Not many tenants may have made a formal complaint to their landlord recently, but we think many tenants will still have important views on this question.</p>

<p>We could have proposed asking tenants this question after they make a formal complaint (a ‘transactional survey’). Asking the question in the tenant perception survey instead means that people who have not made a formal complaint can still have their say. It also avoids this measure being based on the views of a small number of people.</p>

<h3>TP12: Tenant knowledge of how to make a complaint - measured by tenant perception survey</h3>

<p>We are proposing that all tenant perception surveys should include this question:</p>

<p>To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement? “I know how to make a complaint to my landlord if I am not happy with the service I receive.”</p>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of tenants who say they “agree” or “strongly agree”.</p>

<h3>CH01: Complaints relative to the size of the landlord - measured by landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the numbers of complaints the landlord receives for each 1,000 homes they own.</p>

<h3>CH02: Complaints responded to within Complaint Handling Code timescales - measured by: landlords’ management information</h3>

<p>This measure would be based on the percentage of complaints the landlord responds to within the times set by the Housing Ombudsman’s Complaint Handling Code. All social housing landlords have to follow this Code.</p>

<p>The Housing Ombudsman is an independent organisation that tenants can ask to look at complaints about social housing landlords.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> The proposals: The tenant satisfaction measures standard</h2>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing sets standards that all social housing landlords must meet. In certain circumstances where a landlord does not meet one of these standards, we may take action.</p>

<p>We are proposing a new standard that describes what we expect and require of landlords when it comes to tenant satisfaction measures.</p>

<p>Among other things, this standard would require landlords to collect and send us their tenant satisfaction measures results.</p>

<p>Our proposed standard says that landlords must publish their results every year in a way that tenants can easily access and understand.</p>

<p>It also goes into more detail about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when landlords should collect and send us the information</li>
  <li>the accuracy and quality of information we would expect</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read our proposed standard, in full, in Annex 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">Consultation on the introduction of tenant satisfaction measures</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> The proposals: Landlords’ responsibilities</h2>

<h2>Tenant perception surveys</h2>

<p>Our current proposals mean that landlords would be responsible for running tenant perception surveys to collect data for tenant satisfaction measures TP01–TP12.</p>

<p>Landlords with 1,000 or more homes would have to run the survey every year. Landlords with fewer than 1,000 homes would have the option of running it every year or every two years.</p>

<p>Landlords could decide to survey all their tenants (a ‘census survey’). Landlords with many homes would also have the option of surveying only some of their tenants. Landlords who choose this option would have to follow rules we set about how many tenants they survey and how to randomly select who gets surveyed. We are proposing rules that mean the results would be similar to what they would be if they surveyed all tenants.</p>

<p>Landlords would be allowed to run the survey by post, by phone, face to face, online, or however is best for their tenants. They would have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>say at the start of the survey roughly how long it will take to complete</li>
  <li>let tenants know that the survey will be used for tenant satisfaction measures</li>
  <li>include the 12 tenant perception survey questions exactly as we have written them.</li>
</ul>

<p>They would be allowed to include their own questions as well as the 12 required ones.</p>

<p>Landlords would be responsible for making sure their survey results are meaningful. This includes getting enough responses and avoiding carrying out surveys in ways that might stop certain groups of tenants from taking part.</p>

<p>Landlords would need to check whether the mix of people who responded is similar to the mix of people living in their homes. If they see a big difference, they would need to check their survey results to make sure they are accurate.</p>

<p>When they publish their tenant satisfaction measures results, landlords would also have to report how they carried out their tenant perception survey, including how many responses they had.</p>

<h2>Protecting privacy</h2>

<p>Any information tenants provide to help their landlords calculate their tenant satisfaction measures results would be covered by privacy and data protection laws. Landlords would be responsible for making sure they (and any companies they employ to work with the information) are following these laws.</p>

<p>This is important, not just because of the law, but because tenants need to be comfortable giving honest answers to tenant perception surveys. Protecting tenants’ privacy and confidentiality helps with this.</p>

<h2>Reporting results</h2>

<p>Our current proposals mean that all social housing landlords would have to publish their performance on tenant satisfaction measures to their tenants every year.</p>

<p>Only landlords with 1,000 or more homes would also have to submit their data to us.</p>

<p>Landlords would be responsible for making sure they have calculated the results accurately.</p>

<p>All landlords would have to report the results of the tenant satisfaction measures for their whole organisation. If they see that it is useful for their tenants, landlords could also decide to publish the results for specific neighbourhoods, specific local authorities or other groups of homes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> The proposals: Making use of the measures</h2>

<h2>How we will use the measures</h2>

<p>To understand what sort of job landlords are doing for their tenants, we will look at tenant satisfaction measures data alongside other sources of information. This will help us with our regulation of social housing.</p>

<p>The measures might help us spot areas where we need to follow up with a particular landlord to make sure they are meeting our standards.</p>

<h2>What we will make public</h2>

<p>We plan to publish the results of tenant satisfaction measures for all landlords with 1,000 or more homes.</p>

<p>These results will come out once a year.</p>

<p>You can read draft guidance about how landlords provide tenant satisfaction measures information to us, and how we will use it, in Annex 4 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">Consultation on the introduction of tenant satisfaction measures</a>.</p>

<h2>Our impact assessments</h2>

<p>Consultation questions 18 and 19 ask whether you agree with the conclusions in our draft Regulatory Impact Assessment and our draft Equality Impact Assessment.</p>

<p>The draft Regulatory Impact Assessment looks at the costs and benefits of introducing tenant satisfaction measures for us, for landlords and for tenants. The draft Equality Impact Assessment looks at what effects introducing the measures might have on members of groups that are protected by equality laws. We have used these draft assessments to inform our proposals.</p>

<p>You can read the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment in Annex 6 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">Consultation on the introduction of tenant satisfaction measures</a>.

<h2>Question 16</h2>

<p>We propose to tailor our tenant satisfaction measure requirements for registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes.

<span class="number">9. </span> About us</h2>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing regulates registered providers of social housing in England. We want the social housing sector to be viable, efficient, well governed, and able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs.</p>

<p>Registered providers of social housing include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing associations, co-operatives and other non-profit organisations</li>
  <li>profit-making organisations</li>
  <li>local authorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>We regulate social housing in two main ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Economic regulation: helping to make sure registered providers of social housing are financially viable, properly managed and provide value for money.</li>
  <li>Consumer regulation: helping to make sure social housing tenants have quality, well managed housing, and can hold their landlords to account. We set standards for all registered providers of social housing. In certain circumstances, we may take action if a provider breaches these standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>We set standards for all registered providers of social housing. In certain circumstances, we may take action if a provider breaches these standards.</p>

    These measures were proposed in The charter for social housing residents – social housing white paper, but the government is reviewing these areas separately at the moment. We will decide on the next steps for these measures when the government has finished its work. We will ask for views about any proposals we make for these measures at a later date.<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
