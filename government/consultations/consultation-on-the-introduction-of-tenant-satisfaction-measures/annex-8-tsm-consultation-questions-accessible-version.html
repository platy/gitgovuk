<p>13 - Chapter 9 of the consultation document covers some general requirements that apply to all TSMs, which are addressed in more detail in Annex 2 Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements. These include how providers should collect and report the TSMs, the types of homes that should be included, as well as the time period over which data should be reported. Do you agree with these proposals?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agree – please explain.</li>
  <li>Disagree – please explain and provide any alternative suggestions where relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>14 - We propose to allow providers to choose the most appropriate survey collection method (e.g., postal, by phone, online etc.) to obtain data for the tenant perception measures TP01-TP12. Do you agree with this proposal?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agree – please explain.</li>
  <li>Disagree – please explain and provide any alternative suggestions where relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>15 - Chapter 10 of the consultation document covers some requirements that apply to the TSMs which are tenant perception measures (TP01-TP12). These requirements are addressed in more detail in Annex 3 Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. The requirements include survey type, survey timing, response options and who is to be surveyed. Do you agree with these requirements?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agree – please explain.</li>
  <li>Disagree – please explain and provide any alternative suggestions where relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>16 - We propose to tailor our <abbr title="Tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> requirements for registered providers that own fewer than 1,000 relevant homes. This includes not requiring them to submit <abbr title="Tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> data to the regulator, allowing them to collect and report TSMs annually according to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March and allowing them to undertake a census tenant perception survey. Do you agree with this approach?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agree – please explain.</li>
  <li>Disagree – please explain.</li>
</ul>

<p>17 - Chapter 13 of the consultation document covers our proposed guidance about the submission of information to the regulator in relation to the TSMs, which is set out in more detail in Annex 4. This includes generally not using <abbr title="Tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> information as a source of regulatory intelligence in isolation, but rather as information we may take into account alongside other sources. Do you agree with this proposed approach?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agree – please explain.</li>
  <li>Disagree – please explain.</li>
</ul>

<p>18 - Do you agree with our conclusions in the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes – please give details. You are invited to include evidence to support your view.</li>
  <li>No – please give details. You are invited to include evidence to support your view.</li>
</ul>

<p>19 - Do you agree with our conclusions in the draft Equality Impact Assessment? The regulator particularly welcomes views on whether the proposals will have a positive or negative impact on people who share one or more protected characteristics (as set out in the Equality Act 2010).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes – please give details. You are invited to include evidence to support your view. Please do not provide any sensitive personal information in your response.</li>
  <li>No – please give details. You are invited to include evidence to support your view. Please do not provide any sensitive personal information in your response.</li>
</ul>

<p>20 - Finally, if you have anything else that you would like to tell us about the proposals relating to the TSMs, including the detailed requirements set out in Annexes 2 and 3, please tell us.</p>
