<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1 - The Tenant Satisfaction Measures Standard requires all registered providers to generate and report tenant satisfaction measures (<abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>) as specified by the regulator. This document, Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements, sets out the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> as defined by the regulator and requirements of the regulator in relation to these <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that all registered providers must meet. This document sits alongside Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements, which sets out further requirements as to how providers are required to conduct tenant perception surveys to generate a subset of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> (âtenant perception measuresâ).</p>

<p>2 - The <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are a core set of performance measures against which all providers must publish their performance. Providers are not restricted from collecting or publishing additional performance measures or information alongside the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. In addition to its specific expectations, the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard includes the required outcome that providers must collect and provide information to support effective scrutiny by tenants of their landlordâs performance â providers need to determine what information beyond <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> they need to report to meet this outcome.</p>

<p>3 - The central aims of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are to provide tenants with greater transparency about their landlordâs performance and inform the regulator about how a landlord is complying with consumer standards. To achieve these aims it is critical that <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are calculated and reported by providers on a consistent basis.</p>

<p>4 - A summary of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> is set out in Table 1 overleaf. The remainder of this document is structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Section 1 â Common requirements that apply across all <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Section 2 â Definitions and specific requirements for each <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Common Tenant Satisfaction Measures requirements</h2>

<p>5 - This Section sets out requirements that apply across the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to all registered providers. 
<abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to be reported by providers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>6 - All registered providers that own relevant social housing stock must calculate and publish all <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> on an annual basis in accordance with all requirements of this document and Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements.</p>

<p>7 - Providers must report each <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> using the specific description and calculation of each <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> set out in Section 2. For example, following the requirements in Section 2 and the example survey responses in Table 2, the provider would be required to publish the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> TP01 as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Proportion of respondents who report that they are very satisfied or fairly satisfied with the overall service from their landlord.</td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>8 - Other specific requirements on the basis for calculating and reporting for each <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> are set out in Section 2. For tenant perception measures (TP01-TP12), providers must adhere to all requirements in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. These requirements include question wording and response options that providers are required to use in tenant perception surveys to generate each tenant perception measure.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Level of reporting</h2>

<p>9 - <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> must be reported on a registered group basis. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Registered group parents must report consolidated <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for the group, calculated on the basis of all relevant social housing stock owned by themselves and all subsidiary registered providers. Registered group parents are not required to report separate <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for individual registered providers within the group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registered provider that is a member of a group structure, whose parent company is not a registered provider, and which does not have a registered provider subsidiary, must report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in respect of itself only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registered provider not in a group structure must report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for their own organisation only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>10 - For the purposes of reporting <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, registered providers are defined as being members of a group structure if they are subsidiaries and associates of one another within the meaning of those terms as set out in Section 271 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. A registered group parent is a registered provider of social housing which has one or more relevant social housing stock owning registered provider subsidiaries, but which is not itself a subsidiary of another registered provider.</p>

<h2>Relevant social housing stock</h2>

<p>11 - All <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> must be reported for either or both of the following two stock types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Low Cost Rental Accommodation. This includes for example general needs, supported housing, intermediate rent and temporary social housing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Low Cost Home Ownership. This includes, for example, shared ownership properties (which have not been fully staircased).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>12 - Section 2 of this document specifies the relevant stock types that must be included in each <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr>.</p>

<p>13 - <abbr title="Low Cost Rental Accommodation">LCRA</abbr> stock and <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> are defined according to their respective definitions in sections 69 and 70 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (âthe Actâ). Reporting of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> for <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> must not include âfully staircased propertiesâ i.e. properties once occupied under <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> arrangements but where the occupier for example acquired a 100% share of a shared ownership property or repaid an equity loan on a shared equity property in full. For the purposes of this document, the term âtenantâ refers to any resident of <abbr title="Low Cost Rental Accommodation">LCRA</abbr> or <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> stock owned by a provider.</p>

<p>14 - Dwelling units that are not <abbr title="Low Cost Rental Accommodation">LCRA</abbr> or <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> â for example non-social housing, leasehold and other dwelling units that are only social housing by virtue of legacy provisions in the Act <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> â should not be included in the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Dwelling units</h2>

<p>15 - Many of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are defined in terms of numbers of dwelling units owned by providers. For the purposes of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> each of the following is a single dwelling unit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a self-contained unit</li>
  <li>a bed space in non-self-contained housing. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>16 - The headline <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> descriptions in Section 2 use âhomesâ to refer to dwelling units in order to use terminology more likely to be familiar to tenants. Any reference to homes in the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> should be understood as a reference to dwelling units.</p>

<p>17 - The building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> require providers to report the number of dwelling units for which all specified safety checks have been carried out (BS01-BS05). Statutory obligations require providers to conduct a range of safety checks, including on individual dwelling units but also on communal parts or whole buildings that contain multiple dwellings units.</p>

<p>18 - For the purposes of the building safety <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, providers must ensure that all specified checks that could affect the safety of individual dwelling units have been carried out. For example, following the requirements in Section 2 and the example calculation in Table 3, the provider would be required to publish the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> BS02 as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Proportion of homes for which all required fire risk assessments have been carried out.</td>
      <td>33%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>19 - Table 3 As a further example, following the requirements in Section 2 and the example calculation in Table 4, the provider would be required to publish the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> BS01 as follows:</p>

<table>

    <tr>
      <td>Proportion of homes for which all required gas safety checks have been carried out.</td>
      <td>89%</td>

<h2>Ownership</h2>

<p>20 - For the purposes of reporting <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, a provider owns a dwelling unit when it: (a) holds the freehold title or a leasehold interest in that property; and (b) is the body with a direct legal relationship with the occupants of the dwelling unit (this body is often described as the landlord). Dwelling units owned by one provider but managed by another must be reported by the owner. Dwelling units must not be reported as being owned by more than one provider.</p>

<h2>Reporting year and year end dates</h2>

<p>21 - Providers that own 1,000 or more dwelling units of relevant social housing stock <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> must collect information and report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> annually pertaining to a reporting year that runs from 1 April to 31 March. Where this document requires information to be calculated as at year end such providers must report information as at 31 March.</p>

<p>22 - Providers with fewer than 1,000 dwelling units of relevant social housing stock (small providers) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> are permitted to collect and report <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> pertaining to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March. This is a proportionate approach for small providers who can, for example, use a reporting year for <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> that aligns with their particular financial reporting year. Similarly where this document requires information to be calculated at âyear endâ, such providers are permitted to report information at a date other than 31 March. Small providers must use the same reporting start and end dates year-on-year for all <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, except where there is a compelling reason not to do so (e.g., the provider adopts a new financial reporting year), and clearly report which reporting year the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> relate to.</p>

<h2>Data protection and confidentiality</h2>

<p>23 - Providers must ensure they and any contractors are compliant with the relevant privacy and data protection legislation when processing personal data.</p>

<p>24 - Providers must protect respondent confidentiality in order to protect tenants and give respondents confidence to give honest feedback in tenant perception surveys. This includes ensuring that individual respondents are only identifiable to those undertaking the survey, unless the respondents give explicit consent, and this is managed appropriately. This applies to both the conduct of the survey itself, and the publication of results.</p>

<p>25 - Small providers with fewer than 1,000 dwelling units of relevant social housing stock must take a proportionate approach to <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> in order to protect tenant confidentiality. For the smallest of these providers, it may be hard to protect the anonymity of individual tenants if <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are published in full. It is permissible for at least some <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> to be omitted from published information if providers judge this to be a material risk.</p>

<h2>Responsibility for accuracy</h2>

<p>26 - It is ultimately the responsibility of Boards of private registered providers and governing bodies of local authority registered providers to ensure that reported <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> have been calculated accurately and in accordance with regulatory requirements. This is both a general expectation of providers and required under specific expectation 2.3 of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard.</p>
