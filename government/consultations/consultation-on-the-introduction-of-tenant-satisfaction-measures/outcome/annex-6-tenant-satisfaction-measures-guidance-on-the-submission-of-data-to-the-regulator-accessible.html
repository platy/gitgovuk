<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1 - The Tenant Satisfaction Measures Standard includes a specific expectation that all registered providers must annually submit to the regulator information we specify relating to their performance against the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> we set. The Standard also makes clear that this information must be submitted within a timeframe and in a form determined by the regulator. This document sets out guidance about the submission of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator and how we will use the submissions we receive.</p>

<p>2 - In publishing this guidance, the regulator is meeting its statutory duty under section 215(1)(a) of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (the Act), which requires the regulator to publish guidance about the submission of information&nbsp;to the regulator about the performance of registered providers. Section 215(2) of the Act provides that this guidance must, in particular, specify how the regulator will deal with the submissions it receives.</p>

<p>3 - As required by Section 215(3) of the Act, the regulator must have regard to this guidance.</p>

<h2>Submission of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator</h2>

<p>4 - In good time before registered providers are required to make their annual submission of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator, the regulator will specify:
- the information registered providers are required to submit to the regulator relating to their performance against the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>
- the timeframe within which registered providers must submit that information to the regulator; and
- the form in which that information must be submitted.</p>

<p>5 - We will generally do this by issuing a data submission return which registered providers would be required to complete and submit to us.</p>

<p>6 - We may amend our specified requirements in relation to the above matters from time to time. If and when we do, we will ensure that this is done in good time before registered providers are next required to make their annual submission of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information to us.</p>

<p>7 - Only registered providers that own, on a registered group basis, 1,000 or more relevant homes (large providers) will be required to annually submit their <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator. ‘Registered group basis’, and ‘relevant homes’ are defined in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements.</p>

<h2>How the regulator will use the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information it receives</h2>

<h2>Publication of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information by the regulator</h2>

<p>8 - On an annual basis, the regulator will collate <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information submitted to us by large providers and publish the results.</p>

<p>9 - We may also decide to publish other <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information, including contextual information, if we consider it appropriate to do so to help ensure performance against the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> is clear, comparable and accessible for all tenants, or otherwise appropriate having regard to our statutory economic regulation and consumer regulation objectives.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Using <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information as a source of regulatory intelligence</h2>

<p>10 - The regulator will use <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information as a source of regulatory intelligence. We may have regard to such information in making regulatory decisions, including in considering whether our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulatory-standards">regulatory standards</a> have been met by a registered provider, or whether to exercise a regulatory power.</p>

<p>11 - We will not generally use <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information as a source of regulatory intelligence in isolation, but rather we will use it as a source of information that we may have regard to alongside other sources. <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information may help the regulator to identify particular areas where we may wish to seek further assurance from a registered provider that they are meeting our standards. The data may also help us to form a picture of those registered providers that might be at greater risk of failing to meet our standards.</p>

<p>12 - As is the case with the submission of all regulatory data to the regulator, the submission of late, incomplete or inaccurate <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator may be indicative of a weak control environment. Given this, failure to provide accurate and timely <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information may, where appropriate, be reflected in our judgement of a registered provider’s compliance with the regulatory standards.</p>
