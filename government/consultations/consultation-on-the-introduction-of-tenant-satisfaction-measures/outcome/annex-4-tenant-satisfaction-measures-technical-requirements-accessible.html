<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1 - The Tenant Satisfaction Measures Standard requires all registered providers to generate and report tenant satisfaction measures as specified by the regulator. This document, Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements, sets out the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> as defined by the regulator and requirements of the regulator in relation to these <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> that all registered providers must meet. This document sits alongside Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements, which sets out further requirements as to how providers are required to conduct tenant perception surveys to generate a subset of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> (âtenant perception measuresâ).</p>

<p>2 - The <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> are a core set of performance measures against which all providers must publish their performance. Providers are not restricted from collecting or publishing additional performance measures or information alongside the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>. In addition to its specific expectations, the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> Standard includes the required outcome that providers must collect and provide information to support effective scrutiny by tenants of their landlordâs performance â providers need to determine what information they need to report to meet this outcome beyond the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> specified in this document.</p>

<p>3 - The central aims of the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> are to provide tenants with greater transparency about their landlordâs performance and inform the regulator about how a landlord is complying with consumer standards. To achieve these aims it is critical that <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> are calculated and reported by providers on a consistent basis.</p>

<p>4 - A summary of the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> is set out in Table 1 overleaf. The remainder of this document is structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Section 1 â Common requirements that apply across all <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Section 2 â Definitions and specific requirements for each <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Tenant Satisfaction Measures requirements</h2>

<p>5 -  This Section sets out requirements that apply across the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> to all registered providers. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> to be reported by providers</h2>

<p>6 - All registered providers that own relevant social housing stock must calculate and publish all <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> on an annual basis in accordance with all requirements of this document and Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements.</p>

<p>7 - Providers must report each <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> using the specific description and calculation of each <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> set out in Section 2. For example, following the requirements in Section 2 and the example survey responses in Table 2, the provider would be required to publish the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> TP01 as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Proportion of respondents who report that they are satisfied with the overall service from their landlord.</td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>8 -  Other specific requirements on the basis for calculating and reporting for each <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> are set out in Section 2. For tenant perception measures (TP01-TP12), providers must adhere to all requirements in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements. These requirements include question wording and response options that providers are required to use in tenant perception surveys to generate each tenant perception measure.</p>

      <td>Very satisfied</td>
      <td>200 (A)</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied</td>
      <td>200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    <tr>
      <td>TP01 calculation: [(200 (A) + 500 (B)) / 1,000 (C)] x 100 = 70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Level of reporting</h2>

<p>9 - <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> must be reported on a registered group basis. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Registered group parents must report consolidated <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> for the group, calculated on the basis of all relevant social housing stock owned by themselves and all subsidiary registered providers. Registered group parents are not required to report separate <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> for individual registered providers within the group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registered provider that is a member of a group structure, whose parent company is not a registered provider, and which does not have a registered provider subsidiary, must report <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> in respect of itself only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A registered provider not in a group structure must report <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> for their own organisation only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>10 - For the purposes of reporting <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>, registered providers are defined as being members of a group structure if they are subsidiaries and associates of one another within the meaning of those terms as set out in Section 271 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. A registered group parent is a registered provider of social housing which has one or more relevant social housing stock owning registered provider subsidiaries, but which is not itself a subsidiary of another registered provider.</p>

<h2>Relevant social housing stock</h2>

<p>11 - All <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> must be reported for either or both of the following two stock types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low Cost Rental Accommodation - This includes for example general needs, supported housing, intermediate rent and temporary social housing.</li>
  <li>Low Cost Home Ownership - This includes, for example, shared ownership properties (which have not been fully staircased).</li>
</ul>

<p>12 - Section 2 of this document specifies the relevant stock types that must be included in each <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr>.</p>

<p>13 -  <abbr title="Low-cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> stock and <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> are defined according to their respective definitions in sections 69 and 70 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (âthe Actâ). Reporting of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> for <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> must not include âfully staircased propertiesâ i.e. properties once occupied under <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> arrangements but where the occupier for example acquired a 100% share of a shared ownership property or repaid an equity loan on a shared equity property in full. For the purposes of this document, the term âtenantâ refers to any resident of <abbr title="Low-cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> or <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> stock owned by a provider.</p>

<p>14 - Dwelling units that are not <abbr title="Low-cost rental accommodation">LCRA</abbr> or <abbr title="Low-cost home ownership">LCHO</abbr> â for example non-social housing, leasehold and other dwelling units that are only social housing by virtue of legacy provisions in the Act <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> â should not be included in the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Dwelling units</h2>

<p>15 - Many of the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> are defined in terms of numbers of dwelling units owned by providers. For the purposes of the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> each of the following is a single dwelling unit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a self-contained unit</li>
  <li>a bedspace in non-self-contained housing.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>16 - The headline <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> descriptions in Section 2 use âhomesâ to refer to dwelling units in order to use terminology more likely to be familiar to tenants. Any reference to homes in the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> should be understood as a reference to dwelling units.</p>

<p>17 - The building safety <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> require providers to report the number of dwelling units for which all specified safety checks have been carried out (BS01-BS05). Statutory obligations require providers to conduct a range of safety checks, including on individual dwelling units but also on communal parts or whole buildings that contain multiple dwellings units. For the purposes of the building safety <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>, providers must ensure that all specified checks that could affect the safety of individual dwelling units have been carried out<a class="govuk-link" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. For example, following the requirements in Section 2 and the example calculation in Table 3, the provider would be required to publish the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> BS02 as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Proportion of homes for which all required fire risk assessments have been carried out.</td>
      <td>33%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Table 3: Illustration of calculation of BS02 â fire safety checks</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Properties with communal parts that require fire risk assessments</th>
      <th scope="col">No. of relevant dwelling units  FRA carried out</th>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Tower block 1</th>
      <td>50 (A)</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Tower block 2</th>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">BS02 calculation: [50 (A) / 150 (B)] x 100 = 33%</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>18 - As a further example, following the requirements in Section 2 and the example calculation in Table 4, the provider would be required to publish the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> BS01 as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Proportion of homes for which all required gas safety checks have been carried out.</td>
      <td>89%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Ownership</h2>

<p>19 - For the purposes of reporting <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>, a provider owns a dwelling unit when it: (a) holds the freehold title or a leasehold interest in that property; and (b) is the body with a direct legal relationship with the occupants of the dwelling unit (this body is often described as the landlord). Dwelling units owned by one provider but managed by another organisation - such as a managing agent, Arms Length Management Organisation or Tenant Management Organisation, or under a Private Finance Initiative arrangement - must be reported by the owner. Dwelling units must not be reported as being owned by more than one provider.</p>

<h2>Reporting year and year end dates</h2>

<p>20 - Providers  that own 1,000 or more dwelling units  of relevant social housing stock <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> must collect information and report <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> annually pertaining to a reporting year that runs from 1 April to 31 March. Where this document requires information to be calculated as at year end such providers must report information as at 31 March.</p>

<p>21 - Providers with fewer than 1,000 dwelling units of relevant social housing stock (small providers) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> are permitted to collect and report <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> pertaining to a reporting year other than 1 April to 31 March. This is a proportionate approach for small providers who can, for example, use a reporting year for <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> that aligns with their particular financial reporting year. Similarly where this document requires information to be calculated at âyear endâ, such providers are permitted to report information at a date other than 31 March. Small providers must use the same reporting start and end dates year-on-year for all <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr>, except where there is a compelling reason not to do so (e.g., the provider adopts a new financial reporting year), and clearly report which reporting year the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> relate to.</p>

<h2>Data protection and confidentiality</h2>

<p>22 - Providers must ensure they and any contractors are compliant with the relevant privacy and data protection legislation when processing personal data. This includes all processing, including during the collection of <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> data and in the publication of results. Providers must protect respondent confidentiality in order to protect tenants and give respondents confidence to give honest feedback in tenant perception surveys.</p>

<p>23 - Providers with fewer than 1,000 dwelling units of relevant social housing stock must take a proportionate approach to <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> in order to protect tenant confidentiality. For the smallest of these providers, it may be difficult to protect the anonymity of individual tenants if <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> information is published in full. It is permissible for at least some <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> and supporting analysis to be omitted from published information if providers judge this to be a material risk.</p>

<h2>Responsibility for accuracy</h2>

<p>24 - It is ultimately the responsibility of Boards of private registered providers and governing bodies of local authority registered providers to ensure that reported <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measures">TSMs</abbr> have been calculated accurately and in accordance with regulatory requirements. This is both a general expectation of providers and required under specific expectation 2.3 of the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> Standard.</p>

      <td>A responsive repair is a reported defect to the property occupied by one or more tenants that is the landlordâs responsibility to make good. It includes any such repairs within individual dwelling units, as well as communal areas or other parts of buildings that are occupied by at least one tenant. It does not include any repairs that are part of planned or cyclical works. <br> <br> Emergency repairs are repairs that are necessary to prevent serious damage to the building, danger to health, risk to safety or risk of serious loss or damage to the occupierâs property. Non-emergency repairs refer to all other responsive repairs. Providers must include all responsive repairs in the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr>, including where they have commissioned a contractor or third party to carry out repairs and repairs recharged to the tenant or a third party. <br> <br> The completion time for each responsive repair must measure the end-to-end time, from the date that the repair was first brought to the landlordâs attention by the tenant (or other party) until the date that the repair was completed, as confirmed by the contractor/operative. <br> <br> A target timescale represents the maximum end-to-end completion time (days or hours) for a particular type of responsive repair that the provider has set as a service standard. For the purposes of this <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr>, all providers must set such target timescales for emergency and non-emergency responsive repairs as a minimum. Providers are permitted to set more than one target timescale corresponding to different types of non-emergency or emergency responsive repair. For example, within non-emergency responsive repairs providers may set different target timescales for âurgentâ and ânon urgentâ repairs (or for different stock types or management areas). <br> <br> Where different target timescales for emergency or non-emergency repairs are used, providers must combine results to generate the two metrics above with each repair considered against the target timescale pertaining to it. For example, if a provider completed (a) 50 of 100 (50%) urgent responsive repairs within a specific target timescale (10 days); and (b) 90 of 100 (90%) routine responsive repairs within a longer target timeline (20 days); they would calculate the non-emergency repairs metric as (50+90)/ (100+100) = 70% and report Part 1 of the <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> as follows: <br> - 70% of non-emergency responsive repairs completed during the year were completed within the providersâ target timescale. <br> - The target timescales used to generate this <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr> were 10 days for urgent responsive repairs, and 20 days for routine responsive repairs.<br> <br> Each registered provider must report its target timescales used to generate this <abbr title="Tenant Satisfaction Measure">TSM</abbr>.</td>
