<h2>About tenant satisfaction measures</h2>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing is creating a new system for assessing how well social housing landlords in England are doing at providing good quality homes and services. In addition to introducing revised consumer 
standards, this will involve a set of tenant satisfaction measures that social housing landlords must report on. People will be able to use these measures to understand how well landlords are doing.</p>

<p>This document presents the final set of TSMs and a summary of the regulator’s requirements for them. Another document presents a summary of the key areas of feedback we received in the consultation and sets out our decision on the final <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard and accompanying documents. This is called the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">Consultation on the introduction of Tenant satisfaction Measures Decision Statement</a>.</p>

<h3>Why are these changes happening?</h3>

<p>In 2020, the government published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">The charter for social housing residents: social housing white paper</a>, which sets out ways to improve things for people living in social housing.</p>

<p>Some of these are for the Regulator of Social Housing to do. Our document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reshaping-consumer-regulation-our-principles-and-approach">Reshaping consumer regulation: our principles and approach</a> describes the steps we are taking.</p>

<p>One of those steps is bringing in a set of tenant satisfaction measures.</p>

<p>These measures should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>let tenants see how well their landlord is doing</li>
  <li>give us an idea of which landlords might need to improve things.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will this apply to me?</p>

<p>The tenant satisfaction measures will cover all kinds of rented social housing in England where the 
landlord is registered with us (a ‘registered provider’). Some, but not all, of the tenant satisfaction measures  will also cover shared ownership homes.</p>

<h3>How we developed the tenant satisfaction measures and what happens next with them</h3>

<h3>What are we trying to achieve?</h3>

<p>Tenant satisfaction measures are intended to make landlords’ performance more visible to tenants, and help tenants hold their landlords to account.</p>

<p>The Social Housing White Paper stated that we need to design the measures carefully.</p>

<p>Looking at each measure on its own, it should be clear what it tells you about the landlord. Tenants should also be able to use it to compare landlords.</p>

<p>Looking at all the measures together, they should also work as a package to show how well a landlord is doing in some key areas.</p>

<h3>How will tenant satisfaction measures work?</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Flowchart showing how tenant satisfaction measures will work" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/137331/14405_RSH_TSM_Consultation_summary_infographic2-websize.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Coming up with what to measure has only been one part of our work on tenant satisfaction measures. We have also published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> standard that requires landlords to collect, process and publish the information needed for the measures</li>
  <li>a set of requirements that tells landlords how they must collect and publish the information, so that different landlords’ information is consistent and can be compared</li>
  <li>guidance about the submission of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator and how we will use the data we receive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>More detailed information</h3>
<p>More detail about the tenant satisfaction measures and our <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> requirements can be found in the following documents on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">on this consultation webpage</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard</li>
  <li>Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements</li>
  <li>Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements</li>
  <li>Guidance about the submission of Tenant Satisfaction Measures data to the regulator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our approach</h2>

<p>We want the changes we are making to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a meaningful difference to tenants</li>
  <li>be possible for landlords to carry out</li>
  <li>be something we can regulate.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help achieve this, we think that as far as possible, all the tenant satisfaction measures should be relevant, accurate, responsive, deliverable and linked to our objectives.</p>

<h4>Relevant</h4>
<p>The tenant satisfaction measures should provide relevant information. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>letting tenants see how their landlord is performing</li>
  <li>telling us about how well landlords are meeting relevant standards.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accurate</h4>
<p>The measures should be well defined and it should be possible to double-check the results. They should make it possible to compare different landlords, and should make it difficult for landlords to make themselves look better than they really are.</p>

<h4>Responsive</h4>
<p>The measures should only measure things the landlord is actually responsible for. They should not accidentally encourage landlords to do anything that makes things worse for their tenants.</p>

<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>The measures should not be too expensive or complicated to put into practice, either for us or for landlords.</p>

<h4>Linked to our objectives</h4>
<p>There should be a clear link between the measures and the objectives we are trying to achieve as a regulator. The data we ask landlords to provide should help us to meet those objectives.</p>

<h2>The tenant satisfaction measures</h2>

<p>There are 22 tenant satisfaction measures, covering five themes. Ten of these will be measured by landlords directly, and 12 will be measured by landlords carrying out tenant perception surveys.</p>

<p>You can read the full definitions of the tenant satisfaction measures in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements, which you can find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">on this consultation webpage</a>.</p>

<p>There are two additional measures that were proposed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">The charter for social housing
residents – social housing white paper</a>, which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Electrical safety checks</li>
  <li>Percentage of communal areas meeting the required standard.</li>
</ul>

<p>The government is reviewing these areas separately at the moment. We will decide on the next steps for these measures when the government has finished its work. We will ask for views about any proposals we make for these measures at a later date.</p>

<h2>The tenant satisfaction measures standard</h2>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing sets standards that all social housing landlords must meet. In certain circumstances where a landlord does not meet one of these standards, we may take action.</p>

<p>We are introducing a new standard that describes what we expect and require of landlords when it comes to tenant satisfaction measures.</p>

<p>Among other things, this standard will require landlords to collect and publish their tenant satisfaction measures results.</p>

<p>Landlords must publish their results every year in a way that tenants can easily access and understand.</p>

<p>It also goes into more detail about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when landlords should collect and send us the information</li>
  <li>the accuracy and quality of information we will expect.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard, in full, on this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">consultation webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>Landlords’ responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Tenant perception surveys</h3>

<p>Landlords will be responsible for running tenant perception surveys to collect data for tenant satisfaction measures TP01–TP12.</p>

<p>Landlords with 1,000 or more homes will have to run the survey every year. Landlords with fewer than 1,000 homes will have the option of running it every year or every two years.</p>

<p>Landlords will be able to survey all their tenants (a ‘census survey’). Landlords with many homes will also have the option of surveying only some of their tenants. Landlords who choose this option will have to follow rules we have set about how many tenants they survey and how to randomly select who gets surveyed. Our rules mean that the results will be similar to what they would be if they surveyed all tenants.</p>

<p>Landlords will be allowed to run the survey by post, by phone, face to face, online, or however is best for their tenants. They will have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>say at the start of the survey roughly how long it will take to complete</li>
  <li>let tenants know that the survey will be used for tenant satisfaction measures</li>
  <li>include the 12 tenant perception survey questions exactly as we have written them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Landlords will be allowed to include their own questions as well as the 12 required ones.</p>

<p>Landlords will be responsible for making sure their survey results are meaningful. This includes getting enough responses and avoiding carrying out surveys in ways that might stop certain groups of tenants from taking part.</p>

<p>Landlords will need to check whether the mix of people who responded is similar to the mix of people living in their homes. If they see a big difference, they will need to check their survey results to make sure they are accurate. In order to be able to do this, landlords will need to have up to date information on the characteristics of their tenants such as their age, gender, ethnicity etc.</p>

<p>When they publish their tenant satisfaction measures results, landlords will also have to report how they carried out their tenant perception survey, including how many responses they had and any other issues that may affect the results.</p>

<h3>Protecting privacy</h3>

<p>Any information tenants provide to help their landlords calculate their tenant satisfaction measures results will be covered by privacy and data protection laws. Landlords will be responsible for making sure they (and any companies they employ to work with the information) are following these laws.</p>

<p>This is important, not just because of the law, but because tenants need to be comfortable giving honest answers to tenant perception surveys. Protecting tenants’ privacy and confidentiality helps with this.</p>

<h3>Reporting results</h3>

<p>Our requirements mean that all social housing landlords will have to publish their performance on tenant satisfaction measures for their tenants every year.</p>

<p>Landlords with 1,000 or more homes will also have to submit their data to us.</p>

<p>Landlords will be responsible for making sure they have calculated the results accurately.</p>

<p>All landlords will have to report the results of the tenant satisfaction measures for their whole organisation. If they think that it is useful for their tenants, landlords will also be able to publish the results for specific neighbourhoods, specific local authorities or other groups of homes.</p>

<h2>Making use of the measures</h2>

<h3>How we will use the measures</h3>

<p>To understand what sort of job landlords are doing for their tenants, we will look at tenant satisfaction measures data alongside other sources of information. This will help us with our regulation of social housing.</p>

<p>The measures might help us spot areas where we need to follow up with a particular landlord to make sure they are meeting our standards.</p>

<h3>What we will make public</h3>

<p>We will publish the results of tenant satisfaction measures for all landlords with 1,000 or more homes.</p>

<p>These results will come out once a year.</p>

<p>You can read our guidance about how landlords provide tenant satisfaction measures information to us, and how we will use it, on this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">consultation webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>Our impact assessments</h2>

<p>The Regulatory Impact Assessment looks at the costs and benefits of introducing tenant satisfaction measures for us, for landlords and for tenants.</p>

<p>The Equality Impact Assessment looks at what effects introducing the measures might have on members of groups that are protected by equality laws.</p>

<p>We have used these assessments to inform our requirements. You can read both of these documents on this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-introduction-of-tenant-satisfaction-measures">consultation webpage</a>.</p>

<h2>About us</h2>

<p>The Regulator of Social Housing regulates registered providers of social housing in England. We want the social housing sector to be viable, efficient, well governed, and able to deliver homes that meet a range of needs.</p>

<p>Registered providers of social housing include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing associations, co-operatives and other non-profit organisations</li>
  <li>profit-making organisations</li>
  <li>local authorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>We regulate social housing in two main ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Economic regulation: helping to make sure registered providers of social housing are financially viable, properly managed and provide value for money.</li>
  <li>Consumer regulation: helping to make sure social housing tenants have quality, well managed housing, and
can hold their landlords to account.</li>
</ul>

<p>We set standards for all registered providers of social housing. In certain circumstances, we may take action if a provider breaches these standards.</p>
