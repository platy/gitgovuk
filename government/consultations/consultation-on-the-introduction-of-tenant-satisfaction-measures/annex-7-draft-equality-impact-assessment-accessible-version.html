<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1 - The Government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">Social Housing White Paper: The Charter for Social Housing Residents</a> (the White Paper) says that social housing tenants should be given access to a set of clear, comparable tenant satisfaction measures to ensure they can understand their landlord’s performance. It expects the Regulator of Social Housing (the regulator) to bring in a set of tenant satisfaction measures (<abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>) for all registered providers on things that matter to tenants and to develop a process for collecting and publishing these measures. It says that the aims of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide tenants with greater transparency about their landlord’s performance</li>
  <li>inform the regulator about how the landlord is complying with the consumer standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Public sector equality duty</h3>

<p>2 - In developing our proposals for the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, we are mindful of our duty to comply with the public sector equality duty (<abbr title="public sector equality duty">PSED</abbr>) under the Equality Act 2010. The broad aim of <abbr title="public sector equality duty">PSED</abbr> (also known as the general equality duty <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> ) is to integrate consideration of equality and good relations into the day-to-day business of public authorities. In summary, the general equality duty places a duty on public authorities such as the regulator. to have due regard in exercising their functions, to the need to:</p>

<p>a. eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation, and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act 2010</p>

<p>b. advance equality of opportunity between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not. This involves having regard to the need to:</p>

<p>i. Remove or minimise disadvantages suffered by people due to their protected characteristics</p>

<p>ii. Take steps to meet the needs of people with certain protected characteristics where these are different from the needs of others</p>

<p>iii. Encourage people who share a relevant protected characteristic to participate in public life or in other activities where their participation is disproportionately low</p>

<p>c. foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not. This involves having regard to the need to tackle prejudice and promote understanding.</p>

<p>3 - These are sometimes referred to as the three aims of the general equality duty. The general equality duty covers the following protected characteristics: age (including children and young people), disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Marriage or civil partnership is also a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, but this is only relevant to the first aim of the general equality duty (eliminating discrimination etc.).</p>

<h2>Scope of Equality Impact Assessment</h2>

<p>4 - We are consulting on our proposals for the introduction of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>, which are detailed in the consultation document. We are committed to understanding the potential impact on equality of our proposals and addressing those impacts where relevant. It is our intention that tenants should benefit from the greater transparency provided by <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> data.</p>

<p>5 - We have considered the equality impact of our proposals relating to <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr>. In doing so, we have been mindful of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>our <abbr title="public sector equality duty">PSED</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>our statutory duty to exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference and (so far as is possible) is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Government’s Regulators’ Code</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>our statutory duty to perform our functions with a view to achieving (so far as is possible) our two fundamental objectives: the economic regulation objective and the consumer regulation objective. These are set out in section 92K of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>our statutory duty, in setting consumer standards, to have regard to the desirability of registered providers being free to choose how to provide services and conduct business.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6 - Paragraph 10 of this document includes our assessment of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> proposals that we consider have the potential for either a negative or positive equality impact. We have assessed all other proposals and have not found any evidence of either a positive or negative equality impact, so we have concluded that they are likely to have a neutral equality impact. These proposals can be found at paragraph 11S in this document.</p>

<h2>Summary of proposals</h2>

<p>7 - The regulator is carrying out a statutory consultation on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a draft new consumer standard (the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard) which includes specific expectations applicable to all registered providers in relation to the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> set by the regulator (Annex 1)</li>
  <li>a set of proposed <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> which are set out in Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2)</li>
  <li>related requirements which registered providers would be expected to comply with under the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> Standard which are set out in draft in:</li>
</ul>

<p>a. Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Technical Requirements (Annex 2)</p>

<p>b. Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3).</p>

<ul>
  <li>draft guidance about the submission of <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> information to the regulator (Annex 4).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of evidence considered</h2>

<p>8 - The information we have considered as part of this assessment includes the following:</p>

<h3>A. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2019-to-2020-headline-report">English Housing Survey 2019/20</a>:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There were around 4 million social rented sector households (2.4 million housing associations, and 1.6 million local authorities).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most households had a White <abbr title="The ‘householder’ in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented.">HRP</abbr> (81%). Households with an ethnic minority <abbr title="The ‘householder’ in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented.">HRP</abbr> were more prevalent in the <abbr title="social rented sector">SRS</abbr> than the owner-occupied sector (19% compared with 10%), but comparable to the private rented sector (18%).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>54% of households had at least one household member with a long-term illness or disability, compared to 25% in the private rented sector and 31% of owner-occupied households.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just under half of social renters (45%) were in full-time or part- time work and 6% were unemployed. A quarter of social renters were retired and 23% ‘inactive’ (includes those with a long-term illness or disability and those looking after the family or home). The rest were in full-time education (1%).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Households were more likely to have a female <abbr title="The ‘householder’ in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented.">HRP</abbr> (58% with a female <abbr title="The ‘householder’ in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented.">HRP</abbr>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <abbr title="social rented sector">SRS</abbr> had the highest proportion of single person households (41%).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The average age for HRPs was 53 years old, compared to 41 years old for private renters and 58 for owner occupiers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all tenures, 2-3% of HRPs reported they were lesbian, gay, bisexual or any other LGB+ sexual orientation <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> . There were no significant differences by tenure. Overall, there were 450,000 households where the <abbr title="The ‘householder’ in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented.">HRP</abbr> reported they were lesbian, gay, bisexual or any other LGB+ sexual orientation, including 100,000 households in the <abbr title="social rented sector">SRS</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>62% of social renters said they had a religion, compared to 54% of private renters and 64% of owner occupiers. The most prominent religion amongst social renters was Christianity (53%) and the second most prominent religion was Islam (7%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social renters with a Black <abbr title="The ‘householder’ in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented.">HRP</abbr> (18%) were more likely to live in a non-decent home, compared with White or Asian social renters (11% and 7% respectively).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ethnic minority social renters (8%) were more likely to live in a home with a Category 1 hazard than White social renters (5%)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>84% of the stock of <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> was low cost rental stock (including general needs and supported housing and all Affordable Rent tenures), and 7% was low cost home ownership units</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>13% of all stock owned by <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr> was low cost rental supported housing with 65% of this being housing for older people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were approximately 1,200 small <abbr title="private registered providers">PRPs</abbr>, 15% of which were in a group structure, whereas 84% of large providers were in a group structure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>C. <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-registered-provider-social-housing-stock-and-rents-in-england-2020-to-2021">Local Authority Registered Provider social housing stock in England 2020/21</a> summary (based on Local Authority Data Return data):</h3>

<ul>
  <li>93% of stock owned by <abbr title="Local Authority Registered Providers">LARPs</abbr> was general needs and 6.5% was supported housing</li>
</ul>

<h3>D. <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/social-housing-lettings-in-england-april-2019-to-march-2020">Social Housing Lettings analysis 2019/20</a>:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>17% of new households contained a tenant with a long-term illness or disability which prevented them from working</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most lead tenants were White, (82% of new lettings). Black households made up 8% of lettings but made up 4% of the English population. Asian households constituted 5% of lettings but made up 9% of the English population. The remaining 3% were to households with Mixed Race lead tenants, which is proportionate to the population.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Information gaps</h3>

<p>9 - We have identified information gaps in our equality evidence base relating to gender reassignment and pregnancy and maternity for tenants in social housing. It has not been possible to obtain data related to these specific protected characteristics within the social housing sector. As a result, it has not been possible to assess the potential impact (if any) of the proposals on groups of people who share these protected characteristics. The regulator intends to review the equality impacts (further details set out below), and should the evidence suggest that the proposals have, or are likely to affect, groups of people who share gender reassignment or pregnancy and maternity characteristics then we intend to consider this evidence.</p>

<h2>Impact assessment</h2>

<p>10 - In undertaking the <abbr title="Equality Impact Assessment">EQIA</abbr>, the regulator has used data to consider the potential impact of its proposals for each protected characteristic (to the extent that there was sufficient equality data to do so) against each of the three aims of the general equality duty. The table below summarises the aims and the protected characteristics which we understand are most likely to be relevant for the purposes of the <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> proposals, which we think have the potential to impact either positively or negatively on people who share one or more protected characteristics.</p>

      <td>Providers must assess the extent to which their achieved sample is representative of the relevant tenant population and to undertake reasonable checks for differences between the total responses to the tenant perception survey and their tenant population in terms of characteristics associated with different average satisfaction scores. <br> <br> Providers would need to judge which characteristics they include in this assessment based on their tenant profile and available data. <br> <br> The draft of Tenant Satisfaction Measures: Tenant Survey Requirements (Annex 3) says the following characteristics are material for many large providers: stock type (e.g., general needs, housing for older people, other supported housing, temporary social housing), age of respondent, ethnicity, building type (e.g., high rise/flats), property or household size, and geographical area or estate.</td>
      <td>This proposal is relevant to aim 1 (as it may help to identify indirect discrimination if there is a lower level of satisfaction amongst people with a certain protected characteristic) and aim 2 (by registered providers) ensuring a representative group of people participate in the survey) of the general equality duty. <br> <br> We found information that shows that younger social housing tenants and Black, Asian and minority ethnic social housing tenants are less satisfied with their landlord than tenants in other age groups and non-<abbr title="Black, Asian and minority ethnic">BAME</abbr> tenants: <br> <br> - English Housing Survey (EHS) 19-20 Social rented sector report <br> <br> - Human City Institute paper on ethnicity and frontline social housing services <br> <br> - Drivers of Satisfaction amongst Black and minority ethnic tenants report (2008). <br> <br> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/comment/comment/addressing-the-bme-housing-challenge-51685" rel="external">Inside Housing – Addressing the BME housing challenge</a> – this is a relevant news article <br> <br> We have therefore included both age and ethnicity in the list of characteristics that are material for many large providers in considering which characteristics to include in their assessment of representativeness. We also refer to housing for older people and other supported housing as being material factors.  <br> <br> Their inclusion should help to ensure that providers give them sufficient consideration in their assessment of representativeness. <br> <br> We did not find any information which suggests that tenants who share a protected characteristic other than age and race are less likely to be satisfied with their landlord. This does not mean that they are not less satisfied, rather that we could not find evidence of lower satisfaction amongst tenants who share other protected characteristics. However, providers would need to make a balanced judgement as to which characteristics to include in their assessment of representativeness based on their own tenant profile. <br> <br> This means that if other protected characteristics such as disability, religion or belief, or sexual orientation are relevant to their assessment, we would expect them to be included in their check. <br> <br> Providers would be required to publish a summary of their assessment of representativeness of the sample against their relevant tenant population, so would be expected to state the factors they consider to be material, including the protected characteristics. <br> <br> We consider that this proposal is likely to have a positive impact and therefore we propose to consult on this basis.</td>

      <td>This proposal is relevant to aims 1 and 2 of the general equality duty and is particularly relevant to the protected characteristics: age, race, sex and disability. <br> <br> We found information which shows that certain media is more or less likely to be accessible to tenants who share different protected characteristics: <br> <br> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/articles/exploringtheuksdigitaldivide/2019-03-04" rel="external">Exploring the UK’s digital divide - ONS</a> tells us that: <br> <br> - 58% of internet non-users were women <br> <br> - Adults over the age of 65 have consistently made up the largest proportion of adult internet non-users since 2011 <br> <br> - Over half of all adult internet non-users were over the age of 75 in 2018 <br> <br> - In 2017, 56% of adult internet non-users were disabled, compared to the proportion of disabled adults in the UK as a whole, (in 2016- 2017 estimated to be 22%). <br> <br> - In 2011, there were wide disparities in internet use among different racial groups, but in 2018, this gap had narrowed, particularly for adults of Bangladeshi ethnicity. <br> <br> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/04/26-percent-of-uk-people-never-use-their-landline-for-phone-calls.html" rel="external">Research by Uswitch</a> said 95% of people aged over 65 have a landline, which falls to 82% for those aged 35-54 and drops to 52% among 18–24-year-olds. <br> <br> We have reviewed other relevant guidance on survey methods: <br> <br> - The Scottish Housing Regulator’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.housingregulator.gov.scot/for-landlords/advisory-guidance/technical-guidance/conducting-surveys-of-tenants-and-service-users" rel="external">tenant survey guidance</a> recommends the use of postal, telephone or face-to-face surveys, and does not allow online surveys as they say they are unlikely to provide results representative of the wider tenant population. However, the picture of internet usage is very likely to have changed in recent times. <br> <br> - Housemark STAR guidance <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> recognises that providers may use a single survey method, with ‘top-ups’ of an alternative method appropriate for certain hard-to-reach groups or they may use a combination of methods. <br> <br> On the one hand, allowing providers to choose their collection method(s) enables them to influence the results by selecting methods that could produce more favourable responses (there is evidence that collection methods can materially influence survey results, e.g., face-to-face and telephone surveys tend to produce much higher levels of satisfaction than ‘self-completed’ methods such as paper and online surveys). This reduces comparability as two organisations with similar levels of underlying performance could produce very different satisfaction scores by using different collection methods. It also risks providers using a method that is harder for some groups of tenants to participate in. <br> <br> On the other hand, if we specify one main method, not only would some providers be obliged to make significant changes to existing practice (from our stakeholder engagement it appears that providers often use a mix of methods to ensure they can reach different tenant groups effectively), which could be costly and burdensome, but it may also make it more difficult for tenants who share certain protected characteristics to take part in the survey, which would make achieving a representative sample challenging for providers. This is because some collection methods are more effective than others at reaching particular groups (e.g., younger tenants may be more likely to use online surveys, older people may be more likely to take part in postal or phone surveys). <br> <br> On balance, we believe that not restricting providers in the survey methods they use is likely to have a positive equality impact because it would enable providers to tailor their survey methods to meet the needs of their tenant profile. It would also align with our principle of co-regulation and our duty to minimise interference. <br> <br> We therefore propose to consult on this basis. We have asked a specific question about this proposal in the consultation.</td>

      <td>The proposal is relevant to all aims of the general equality duty. <br> <br> There are more than 1,000 small <abbr title="registered providers">RPs</abbr> or small registered groups that own fewer than 1,000 units of social housing properties. <br> <br> There is around a 50%/50% split between General Needs and supported housing/ housing for older people. <br> <br> In contrast, larger groups and providers (those who own more than 1,000 units of social housing properties) hold a much higher proportion of General Needs properties, with more than four General Needs unit for every <abbr title="supported housing/ housing for older people">SHHOP</abbr> unit. <br> <br> Small providers own a higher proportion of <abbr title="supported housing/ housing for older people">SHHOP</abbr> properties than large providers, so their tenants are more likely to share the protected characteristics age and disability. <br> <br> There is the potential for tenants of small providers to be negatively impacted by this proposal, as they would not be able to compare their landlord’s performance via the regulator’s published data. However, we are proposing this for the following reasons: <br> <br> - There are statistical challenges for small providers that are less relevant for larger providers, which affect their tenant perception survey data. For perception survey results to be meaningful, they need to be based on a sufficiently large, and representative sample of tenants to produce statistically significant results. If it is not, the reported results may not be a representative reflection of tenant views. It is much more difficult for small providers to achieve a statistically robust sample as the minimum sample needed is a much larger proportion of their stock. It would therefore be more difficult for tenants to be able to make meaningful comparisons with other similar sized providers. <br> <br> •	As well as the challenge around sample sizes, and robustness of the resulting data, privacy is an issue for the very smallest providers, where individual survey responses could be easily identified by other tenants or their landlord. <br> <br> - A number of other <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSMs</abbr> are subject to factors that are likely to be amplified for small providers, making <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> data a less reliable source of intelligence on the performance of these providers. <br> <br> - Small providers may have less capacity to provide data returns in a specific format required by the regulator. <br> <br> - We have had due regard to our duty to exercise our functions in a way that minimises interference and (as far as is possible) is proportionate. <br> <br> Tenants of small providers would be able to hold their own landlord to account as they would be required to publish their <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> data in accordance with our requirements, which would lead to greater transparency and accountability. <br> <br> We acknowledge that there is a potential negative impact from this proposal, as tenants of small providers would not be able to compare <abbr title="tenant satisfaction measures">TSM</abbr> data of their landlord with that of others via the regulator’s published data, and they are more likely to share the protected characteristics age and disability than tenants of large providers. However, we don’t believe that putting this information into the public domain would help to advance equality, as we think that the data from small providers is highly likely to be less comparable than data from large providers, which means that tenants would not be able to make meaningful comparisons with other similar sized providers and we would not have confidence in the validity of the data from small providers. We therefore propose to continue with this proposal, subject to the outcome of the consultation.</td>
