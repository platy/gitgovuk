<p>In response to the consultation carried out between 20 January 2020 to 13 April 2020, MCA received responses from 10 stakeholders from harbour authorities, commercial shipping, recreation, fishing, navigation consultants, Government departments, General Lighthouse Authority and offshore renewable energy developers. Comments and MCA response were as follows:</p>

      <td>The relevence of this MGN being updated is to highlight to mariners who operate in the vicinty of a windfarm and hence with more developments being consented within sea areas then safety of navaigation around such sites will become more of an issue. Also redoing this m notice will refresh and highlight this especially to new officers and those who are studying for certificates of competency and may not have the basic knowledge that is assumed or required. The Mariners Handbook may not be studied as much as a new MGN both at college or onboard ships. Many mariners may not necessarily have operated within areas that have OWF that pose a risk to navigation. This MGN applies to fishermen hence should there be a section on fishing in the vicinity of the OWF which would additionally mention cables and thus should then MGN 661 (M+F) Navigation - safe and responsible anchoring and fishing practices be mentioned to be read at the in conjuction with this notice. <br><br>Number of developments to be updated as per 2022, could highlight what floating wind farm sites are going through consenting.<br><br>It may make this section clearer and easier to understand if diagrams are within this section directly showing an example of the layout. Perhaps this section 2 could only including lighting, markings and sound signals etc This could include reference to floating wind. Then move to next section on charting etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Section could be updated for more recent reports.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This point on the “Careful adjustment of radar controls can suppress some of these spurious radar returns but mariners are warned that there is a consequent risk of losing targets with a small radar cross section, which may include buoys or small craft, particularly yachts or GRP constructed craft, therefore due care should be taken in making such adjustments.” [It] Highlights the dangers of reduction of gain or increase of seaclutter and potential effects.<br><br>Offshore Wave and Tidal Energy Installations - Section should be updated relating to the modern technologies available and also perhaps there could be more indepth diagrams showing these types of installation could be marked or indeed the structures could be moored subsea etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Could this section explain and define safety zones, restricted zones and exclusion zones explaining the differences between these definitions giving clear advice to marininers. Marine coordination could be mentioned and its relationship with OWF’s and thus how non windfarm traffic is managed.<br><br>Might be worth mentioning that higher traffic densities of windfarm employed vessels can be expected during construction periods or in summer months.<br><br>Unmanned survey vessels are becoming more prevalent in offshore windfarms. These vessels tend to be small in size with a shallow profile. They operate within windfarm boundaries and along export cable routes.<br><br>Typo in last sentence - “A good lookout should be therefore be maintained at all times”<br><br>During construction of windfarms employing monopile turbines there is a period prior to the Transition Piece being installed that un painted monpiles sitting at or just above the surface.<br><br>Not all turbines have ladder access. [ ] are trialling ladder free turbines that could become more prevalent in future.<br><br>I believe helicopter rescues can only be conducted from the nacelle and not from the main access platform on the transition piece.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The planned optional parks information is useful, do the MCA have any plans to attach areas of development in a map format at the end of the MGN? And update it say on annual basis?<br><br><br><br>States “The turbines typically comprise: a foundation below sea level…”. Although previously mentioned it could be a floating structure I think would be useful to elaborate on this and basic configuration of a floating structure (could direct the MCA to the OWA study and most common floating systems, states confidential but worth asking Sol if drawing can be shared with MCA?).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Comment as above, if submarine cables may be charted then floating surbine spreads should also be charted and mentioned to give greater clarity of beneath the waterline and seabed. Avoid anchoring except in emergencies when in close proximity to floating OREIs.<br><br><br><br>To include mention of involved in the transfer of offshore technicians within “Small high speed vessels or larger vessels involved in turbine maintenance and safety duties may be encountered within or around a wind farm.” It could also be included within any amended text that offshore technicians travel to and from the turbines almost daily.<br><br>States “In such conditions mariners are required, under Rule 5 Lookout to take into account information from other sources which may include sound signals and VHF information, for example from a VTS, or AIS. Mariners should bear in mind though that not all vessels are equipped with AIS. “ could then make reference to MGN 324 Navigation: Watchkeeping Safety - Use of VHFRadio and AIS (in relation to useage in collision avoidance).<br><br>Typo of sheer to be amended to shear (wind shear).<br><br>Missing full stop after “Wave energy convertors (WECs) capture kinetic energy carried by waves”.<br><br>Missing full stop after “Movements along its length can be selectively constrained to produce energy”.<br><br>Would be beneficial to include a basic drawing within MGN to show the maximum diameter of blades likely to be encountered when manoeuvring in close proximity to OWF and arrows showing rotational motion. Unlikely mariners are not aware of this but to emphasis the danger when at the planning stage of a passage plan.<br><br>States recommended colour above waterline is yellow but the example shows red… Would it be possible to include an example with the colour yellow?<br><br>Would be useful to include a small note in the appropriate section highlighting to mariners that during the different stages of a wind park there ie likely to be far more traffic in and outbound to site under construction, execution and decommissioning. Examples of types of vessels likely to be encountered (general overview?).</td>
