      <td>Was more than 70% of the charity’s income derived from one income stream in the financial period for this return?</td>
      <td>Charities are asked to first identify their total annual income. Once they have done this, they need to identify the different ways in which income has been received such as through Local Authority grants, rental income from properties owned by the charity, or other means. Once this has been established, they should then calculate the total income received from each source to work out what percentage of total income it is. Should more than 70% have been received from one of these sources then answer yes.<br><br>For example:<br><br>• Total income £100,000<br>• Income from Local Authority grants £71,000 equates to 71%<br>• Income from donations £29,000 equates to 29%<br>• Answer YES<br><br>• Total income £100,000<br>• Income from Local Authority grants £70,400 equates to 70%<br>• Income from donations £29,600 equates to 30%<br>• Answer NO</td>

      <td>Has the charity received a donation(s) exceeding 25% of total income from a single corporate donor in the financial period for this return?</td>
      <td>To answer this question a charity must identify the total income received through donations. They then need to determine who has donated the income and calculate the total amount received from each corporate donor. This number should then be converted to a percentage of overall income. If the amount received from each corporate donor is less than 25% of total income then the answer to the question is no. If the amount received from a single corporate donor exceeds 25% then the answer is yes. See glossary for definition of terms.<br><br>For example: <br><br>• Total  income £70,000<br>• Donations from a single corporate donor £1,000 = 1.4%<br>• Answer NO</td>

In these circumstances it is good practice to formalise any agreements with partners who are based overseas by having written agreements. This is an indication that trustees have properly protected the charity’s legal position and have acted in the charity’s best interests.
