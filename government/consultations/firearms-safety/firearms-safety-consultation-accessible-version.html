<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>The firearms laws in this country are among the toughest in the world and the Government 
keeps them under constant review to ensure they continue to safeguard the public.</p>

<p>While lawful shooting is well regulated and generally safe, there remains a risk of firearms 
falling into the hands of criminals or terrorists, or in the case of air weapons, being 
misused. Public safety is paramount and the Government is committed to doing all that it 
can to reduce these risks.</p>

<p>We have strengthened firearms law significantly in recent years. For example, we have 
introduced new offences to prevent the conversion of imitation firearms and the sale of 
‘defectively deactivated’ firearms, and we have banned rapid-firing rifles and bump stocks. 
We have also just laid regulations before Parliament that will strengthen controls on 
antique firearms to tackle their use in crime. As set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/serious-violence-strategy">Serious Violence Strategy</a>, 
we will be further strengthening the controls through more effective use of medical 
information in licensing decisions.</p>

<p>In this consultation I am seeking your views on a range of firearms safety issues that were 
raised in Parliament during the passage of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019. In particular, 
there was much debate about strengthening the controls on high muzzle energy rifles,
including whether these should be prohibited under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. 
The Government decided that this question required further detailed consideration. This 
consultation seeks your views on how we might address the threat that these weapons
pose should they fall into the wrong hands, including through enhanced security 
arrangements to reduce the risk of them doing so.</p>

<p>I am also seeking your views on improving the controls on air weapons, including safe 
storage. This follows on from a Home Office review of the regulation of air weapons, 
initiated after the tragic death of 13-year old Benjamin Wragge, who was killed accidentally 
with an air weapon in 2016.</p>

<p>Finally, I would welcome your views on two other public safety issues that were raised 
during the passage of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 through Parliament: how we might 
address vulnerabilities presented by the current exemption from licensing that applies to 
miniature rifle ranges, and whether we should strengthen controls on components of 
ammunition.</p>

<p>I very much hope you will respond to this important consultation paper. Your views will 
help us to improve our firearms controls and help keep people safe.</p>

<p>Kit Malthouse MP
Minister of State for Crime and Policing</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>This consultation seeks views on a range of firearms safety issues which were raised with 
the Government during the passage of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019. It contains 
proposals for how the law might be changed to mitigate the risks raised by these issues.</p>

<h3>High muzzle energy rifles</h3>

<p>In response to concerns about the potential for serious misuse and loss of life if particularly 
powerful firearms, described here as high muzzle energy rifles, were to fall into the hands 
of criminals or terrorists, the Government included measures to prohibit ownership of these 
weapons in the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 on its introduction in the House of 
Commons. However, it became clear during the passage of the Act that prohibiting these 
weapons may not be necessary, bearing in mind that there was no evidence of their use in 
crime. It was suggested instead that enhanced security could sufficiently mitigate the risk 
of theft and misuse. Following careful consideration, the provision in the Act was 
withdrawn on the basis that the Government would test the alternatives through this public 
consultation.</p>

<p>This consultation therefore seeks views on what level of enhanced security would 
sufficiently reduce the risk of high muzzle energy rifles being stolen and misused.</p>

<h3>Air weapons</h3>

<p>Although most air weapons are not licensed, they are firearms and they are regulated by 
firearms legislation to prevent their misuse. Following the tragic death of 13-year old 
Benjamin Wragge, who was killed accidentally with an air weapon in 2016, the 
Government conducted a review of the controls on air weapons. This consultation 
summarises the responses to that review and seeks views on the Government’s proposals 
for change. These proposals relate to the possession of air weapons by under-18s, 
secure storage and the safe-keeping of air weapons.</p>

<h3>Miniature rifle ranges</h3>

<p>There is an exemption in firearms law which allows a person to run a rifle range or 
shooting gallery where only small calibre rifles or air weapons are used, without the need 
for a firearms licence. Additionally, members of the public do not need a firearms licence 
to shoot at such a range or gallery. This exemption is widely used to introduce people to 
target shooting. However, law enforcement has raised concerns that the exemption may
allow unsuitable people to gain access to firearms, with consequent public safety risks.</p>

<p>This consultation seeks views on improving the controls on miniature rifle ranges while 
retaining the benefits that miniature rifle ranges present to shooting sports. The key 
proposal is that anyone who wishes to operate a miniature rifle range must apply for a 
firearm certificate and undergo the necessary police checks into their background and 
security.</p>

<h3>Ammunition</h3>

<p>Law enforcement has raised concerns about the availability of component parts of 
ammunition, and how criminals could use them to unlawfully manufacture full rounds of
ammunition. The key components of ammunition – the propellant and primer – are 
already controlled, and there are offences relating to the unlawful possession of complete
ammunition. This consultation seeks views on whether these controls remain sufficient or 
whether they should be strengthened.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Firearms legislation in Great Britain is primarily set out in the Firearms Act 1968 and is 
based firmly on public safety. The Government recognises that firearms are used for a 
range of legitimate purposes, such as target shooting, quarry shooting and pest control,
and the vast majority are used safely and responsibly. While the controls must protect the 
public from misuse, they must also be proportionate and administered fairly.</p>

<p>The Home Office’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/518193/Guidance_on_Firearms_Licensing_Law_April_2016_v20.pdf" rel="external">Guide on Firearms Licensing Law 2016</a> explains how the licensing 
system works and how different types of firearm are controlled. The guidance is currently 
being updated to reflect recent changes to the law but the general system of controls 
remains the same.</p>

<p>Firearms law is kept under review to ensure it addresses emerging risks to public safety. 
This consultation seeks views on the following firearms safety issues which were raised 
with the Government during the passage of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 through 
Parliament:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High muzzle energy rifles</li>
  <li>Air weapons</li>
  <li>Miniature rifle ranges, and</li>
  <li>Components of ammunition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Impact assessments for each of these issues have been published alongside this 
consultation. You are invited to submit any comments you may have on the impact 
assessments as part of your response.</p>

<p>The Firearms Act 1968 extends to England, Wales and Scotland, with the exception of the 
regulation of air weapons in Scotland, which is devolved. The control of firearms is 
generally subject to separate legislation in Northern Ireland. This consultation is therefore 
primarily aimed at people, businesses and organisations in England, Wales and Scotland. 
The Government is engaging with the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland on the 
proposals in this consultation to ensure that, where appropriate, firearms controls are 
strengthened UK-wide.</p>

<h2>The proposals</h2>

<h3>High muzzle energy rifles</h3>

<p>This section invites views on whether enhanced home security and stricter controls on the 
storage and possession of the ammunition and critical component parts of high muzzle 
energy rifles would be sufficient to mitigate the potential risk of these rifles falling into the 
wrong hands.</p>

<h4>Definition of high muzzle energy rifle</h4>

<p>For the purpose of this consultation, we are defining high muzzle energy rifle as any rifle 
that is capable of discharging a bullet with kinetic energy of more than 13,600 joules at the
muzzle of the weapon.</p>

<h4>The issue</h4>

<p>Concerns have been expressed about the potential for serious misuse and loss of life if a
high muzzle energy rifle, currently subject to general licensing arrangements under section 
1 of the Firearms Act 1968, fell into the hands of criminals or terrorists. In view of the 
threat assessment received, the Government considered that there were good grounds to 
impose stricter controls on their possession and, following an earlier public consultation, 
provision was made in the Offensive Weapons Act 2019, in its introduction to Parliament, 
to make all high muzzle energy rifles that meet the definition above subject to general 
prohibition.</p>

<p>This issue was debated extensively during the early stages of the Act’s Parliamentary 
passage when concerns were raised regarding the proportionality of prohibiting these 
rifles, bearing in mind that only one had been reported stolen in recent years and there 
was no evidence of their use in crime in this country. Given the particular characteristics 
of these rifles – their weight and size, for example – it was suggested that enhanced 
security around their storage and transportation would sufficiently mitigate the risk of theft 
and misuse that had been articulated by the police and others.</p>

<p>The Government recognises that the vast majority of people in lawful possession of 
firearms use them responsibly and, in the context of the Offensive Weapons Act, the 
Government gave an undertaking to consider further the points which were raised about 
possible alternatives to prohibition. The measures in the Act were therefore withdrawn 
during its passage through Parliament on the basis that the Government would test the 
alternatives further through this consultation. Without seeking to anticipate the outcome of 
this consultation, section 61 of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 has inserted a new 
section 27A into the Firearms Act 1968 to impose a duty on the Secretary of State to make 
rules prescribing minimum security conditions for safe storage and transportation of high 
muzzle energy rifles, which would be attached to the owner’s firearm certificate. Before 
making the rules, the Secretary of State must consult persons likely to be affected by 
them, and this would take place, if appropriate, if the outcome of this consultation were to 
lead to enhanced security measures in relation to these specific firearms.</p>

<p>This consultation provides an opportunity for everybody to have their say on the prohibition 
of high muzzle energy rifles and the alternative of mandatory security standards or storage 
when not in use at a shooting club or by a registered firearms dealer. It will enable the 
Government to take a more informed view in the light of the consultation responses. In the 
meantime, the current standards expected in firearms licensing will remain in place 
alongside any conditions imposed by the local police force.</p>

<h4>Current security arrangements for all firearms</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/953881/Firearms_Security_Manual_2020.pdf" rel="external">Firearms Security Handbook</a> provides advice on the safe storage of firearms and 
shotguns that are held by individuals on certificates issued by police forces. It sets out 
three levels of security, with level 1 security – the normal standards of security applicable 
to the majority of firearms held on a firearms certificate - typically including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a requirement that the firearm be kept in a secure gun cabinet that meets the 
relevant security standards (i.e. BS7558);</li>
  <li>that the cabinet be fixed to the structure of the property within the occupied part of 
the building (i.e. not in a detached garage or outbuilding); and</li>
  <li>that the firearms, ammunition and any easily removable component parts be stored 
separately to the firearm itself, wherever possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The police may require heightened security requirements – levels 2 and 3 – where there 
are greater risks, such as arising from the nature of the firearm in question, its potential 
danger if misused or potential attractiveness to criminals or terrorists. For level 2, this may 
include enhanced door and window locks on the property and the fitting of an audible 
intruder alarm. Level 3 security can include enhanced target hardening of the windows 
and doors to the property, stronger storage cabinets, individual gun locks, a monitored 
audible intruder alarm and in some instances a requirement to store the firearm in a 
dedicated and secure gun room.</p>

<p>The police take account of the Security Handbook when making decisions about security 
requirements in individual cases, but the Handbook is a guide only and carries no statutory 
weight.</p>

<h4>Additional security conditions</h4>

<p>As noted earlier, section 27A of the Firearms Act 1968 places a duty on the Secretary of 
State to make rules prescribing the conditions to be attached to any firearm certificate 
relating to high muzzle energy rifles in respect of how they should be stored when not in 
use, including when they are in transit. Once the rules have been made, chief officers of 
police must add these requirements to all firearms certificates covering these rifles that are 
issued or renewed after the regulations come into force.</p>

<p>We are seeking views on whether the current highest standards of security (level 3 in the 
Firearms Security Handbook) are sufficient or whether even more enhanced security, or 
restrictions on storage when not in use, will go further in reducing the potential risk of theft, 
loss or misuse of high muzzle energy rifles. In particular, we would welcome views on the 
following:</p>

<p>Q1. To what extent do you consider that the present level 3 security requirements, 
if specified in rules made by the Secretary of State, would be sufficient to mitigate 
the risks posed by high muzzle energy rifles, as described above?</p>

<p>Q2. If you do not consider level 3 security would adequately address the risks, to 
what extent do you consider that the following additional security conditions could 
be relevant to the safe storage and use of these rifles?</p>

<p>a) Fitting shutters and grilles on all doors and windows?</p>

<p>b) Installing CCTV?</p>

<p>c) Panic alarms available where the rifle is stored?</p>

<p>d) Panic alarms available when the rifle is in use on a range?</p>

<p>e) The bolt or other critical component parts be kept separately?</p>

<p>f) If viable, and with a change in the law or certificate conditions, other 
members of the holder’s shooting club to look after critical components on behalf of 
each other?</p>

<p>g) Ammunition to be kept separate from the gun in a separate cabinet and only 
a small number of rounds of ammunition allowed?</p>

<p>Q3. To what extent would it be preferable/viable to require these rifles to be stored 
only at a gun club?</p>

<p>Q4. To what extent would it be preferable/viable to require these rifles to be stored 
only by a registered firearms dealer?</p>

<p>Q5. Any other comments on these proposals for additional security measures for 
high muzzle-energy rifles, including any comments on the costs and assumptions 
used in the impact assessment and any costs not included? (max 250 words)

<h3>Air weapons</h3>

<h4>Definition of air weapons</h4>

<p>Air guns, air rifles and air pistols are weapons that expel projectiles with compressed gas 
(usually air) rather than with an explosion. They are exempt from firearms licensing 
requirements unless they are classified as “specially dangerous”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> or are prohibited under 
section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968. The definition of “specially dangerous” covers air rifles 
capable of muzzle energy exceeding 12 foot pounds and it is therefore an offence to 
possess one without a firearm certificate issued by the police. Air pistols capable of 
muzzle energy exceeding 6 ft lbs are prohibited weapons, and it is an offence to possess 
one without the authority of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Air weapons are important tools in pest control, particularly in situations where the use of 
conventional ammunition would not be appropriate. They are widely used in competitive 
target shooting and air weapon events are included in the Summer Olympics and 
Paralympic Games. Many people use air weapons as an introduction to shooting and to 
learn basic marksmanship and safe handling skills that are applicable to other firearms.</p>

<h4>Regulation of air weapons</h4>

<p>While most air weapons will not be subject to licensing in England and Wales, air weapons 
capable of muzzle energy above one joule are nevertheless classified as firearms and 
regulated by the Firearms Act 1968<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. This means, for example, that the prohibition from 
possessing firearms for life placed on anybody who is sent to prison for three years or 
more includes the possession of air weapons. There are also restrictions on possession, 
including by young people. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is an offence for a person in possession of an air weapon to fail to take reasonable

<h4>The misuse of air weapons</h4>

<h4>Crime</h4>

<p>In the year to March 2019, there were 3,028 air weapon offences recorded by the police in 
England and Wales, 50% fewer than a decade previously (2008/09) and a 78% reduction 
since 2002/03. In the year to March 2019, air weapons were used in around 32% of 
offences involving firearms. Air weapons are rarely used in serious offences – almost two 
thirds (64%) of offences involving air weapons are criminal damage.</p>

<p>In the year ending March 2019, the police recorded two fatal injuries, 27 serious injuries, 
and 233 minor injuries in offences involving air weapons. This is similar to the previous 
year where the police recorded one fatal injury, 34 serious injuries and 309 slight injuries.</p>

<p>The number of injuries from offences involving air weapons has fallen substantially from a 
decade ago (2008/09), when there were no fatal injuries, 72 serious injuries and 621 slight 
injuries.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> Younger people aged 10-34 are disproportionately more likely to be victims of 
firearms crimes than the general population. Those under the age of 25 experience 41% 
of all air weapon crime and 36% of all firearm crime, despite being 30% of the population 
(including the 12% of the population that is under the age of 10). Young people aged 10-
19 are 12% of the population but are the victims of 27% of air weapon crimes.</p>

<h4>Animal welfare</h4>

<p>Although there are no official statistics covering this issue, we know that air weapons are 
used in unlawful attacks on animals. Since 2012, the RSPCA has received over one 
thousand complaints per year about animals being unlawfully shot with air weapons, of 
which around 400 per year relate to domestic cats. The perpetrators are thought to be 
disproportionately young people, with complaints peaking during school holidays.</p>

<h4>Fatal incidents involving air weapons</h4>

<p>There are no official statistics on fatal incidents involving air weapons apart from those 
relating to air weapon offences recorded by the police. However, from open source 
research, we think that there have been at least 25 deaths caused by air weapon 
shootings in Great Britain since 2005. These include accidental deaths, deliberate self-harm and homicides. It appears that 12 of these 25 victims were under the age of 18 and 
in nine of these 12 cases the person holding the firearm was said to be under the age of 
18.</p>

<h4>Review of the regulation of air weapons</h4>

<p>The Government announced in October 2017 that it was to undertake a review of the 
regulation of air weapons in England and Wales. This followed a recommendation from the 
Senior Coroner for Suffolk in his report into the death of 13-year-old Benjamin Wragge, 
who was accidentally shot with an air rifle in 2016. The coroner requested that the 
Government review the regulation of air weapons so that steps may be taken to prevent 
similar tragedies occurring in the future.</p>

<p>The review considered air weapons that sit below the definition of “specially dangerous”; 
that is, it focused on air weapons that can be lawfully held without a firearm certificate in 
 England and Wales. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, responsibility for policy on air 
weapons is devolved and licensing systems are in place.</p>

<p>The Home Office wrote to a range of interested parties in December 2017 to seek views, 
including from the police, shooting organisations, the families of victims and their MPs, and 
the charities, Cats Protection and the RSPCA. Views were sought on key issues 
including: access to air weapons by children and young persons, secure storage and safe-keeping, manufacturing standards, the post-sale modification of air weapons to increase 
the power levels, and whether there would be merit in introducing a licensing regime for air 
weapons in England and Wales.</p>

<h4>Responses from victims’ families and their MPs</h4>

<p>We received responses from the families, friends and MPs of victims of air weapon 
incidents, and from the campaigning organisation the Gun Control Network. Almost all of 
these respondents said that air weapons should be subject to a licensing regime. They 
argued, for example, that licensing would enable checks on the suitability of air weapon 
owners (including medical checks), assist in the identification of offenders, enable the 
inspection of storage arrangements and, more broadly, change the culture so that air 
weapons are no longer seen as “toys” or “imitations”.</p>

<p>These respondents generally argued that other regulatory measures should be introduced
in addition to licensing, such as a requirement that the gun be stored in a secure cabinet or 
a requirement that young shooters are supervised.</p>

<h4>Responses from the police and law enforcement bodies</h4>

<p>The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) did not argue strongly for changes to the law. 
However, the NPCC suggested that it may be appropriate to raise the age at which young 
people can possess air weapons without supervision on private land, and that the 
requirement to take “reasonable precautions” to prevent access by under-18s is subjective 
and that further clarity may be helpful.</p>

<p>The NPCC invited the National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) to respond on the 
issues of manufacturing standards, post-sale modification and whether steps should be 
taken to prevent tampering with power levels. NABIS argued that no further steps were 
needed in these areas, as the vast majority of air weapons are intrinsically safe and very 
few air weapons that come to the attention of law enforcement bodies are above the
relevant muzzle energy threshold. We also asked examiners at the Metropolitan Police 
Service’s Forensic Firearms Unit (FFU) for their views. FFU examiners considered that 
there are very few incidents where over-powered or poorly manufactured air weapons 
come to their attention, and that the current law enables prosecution where air weapons 
are capable of muzzle energy above this threshold but are held without a certificate.</p>

<p>The British Transport Police argued that air weapons should be subject to a licensing 
regime. They argued that they should be subject to the same storage and “good reason” 
requirements as other firearms held on certificate and that there should be an audit trail of 
individual weapons.</p>

<p>The Police and Crime Commissioners for Northamptonshire, Dorset and Suffolk all 
suggested that there should be a form of licensing or simplified registration, not 
necessarily administered by the police.</p>

<h4>Response from animal welfare charities and public campaigns</h4>

<p>Animal welfare charities including Cats Protection, the RSPCA, the Scottish SPCA, the 
Irish SPCA, Blue Cross and the Battersea Cats and Dogs Home responded to the review. 
All of them reported a high number of air weapon attacks on pets, particularly cats, and 
other animals. All these organisations support the introduction of licensing, with an
accompanying requirement that the licence holder have a valid reason for possession. 
They argued that licensing would restrict ownership to those with a valid reason to 
possess an air weapon and enable the police to identify offenders.</p>

<p>The Government received almost 52,000 emails from members of the public which 
reported the findings of Cats Protection that, according to its analysis of press reports, at 
least three cats are attacked with air weapons each week. These respondents advocated 
the introduction of licensing to manage who can possess air weapons and enable the 
police to identify suspects. Many of these respondents detailed injuries to their own pets 
caused by air weapons. Over 200,000 people signed a petition requesting a licensing 
scheme following the shooting of a family of swans in December 2018 and more than 700 
people sent emails to the Home Office about the incident.</p>

<h4>Responses from shooters</h4>

<p>A number of organisations who represent the interests of shooters and the firearms 
industry responded to the review. These included the British Association for Shooting and 
Conservation, the Gun Trade Association, the National Small-Bore Rifle Association, the 
British Shooting Sports Council, the Countryside Alliance, the National Rifle Association, 
and the Airgun Manufacturing and Trade Association. All these organisations opposed the 
introduction of a licensing scheme for air weapons, or any increase in regulation.</p>

<p>These organisations argued that the current regulations are sufficient and need to be 
properly enforced. Some of them proposed improved education of owners about the law 
and firearms safety, although others suggested that those most in need of education would 
be least likely to engage.</p>

<p>Over 1,600 people, many of whom identified themselves as shooters or air weapons 
owners, wrote to oppose the introduction of a licensing regime. These respondents 
typically opposed any tightening of the regulations governing air weapons. Many of them
argued that the existing legislation needs to be better enforced, and some argued for 
increased penalties for offences. Around 100 of these respondents proposed some form 
of increased regulation, such as tighter security to make it more difficult for children to gain 
access to air weapons.</p>

<h4>Outcomes of the review</h4>

<p>On the balance of the evidence put forward, we consider that action to mandate 
manufacturing standards, including further steps to deter post-sale modification, would not 
be proportionate. However, we will keep this issue under review.</p>

<p>We have decided not to introduce a licensing regime for air weapons in England and 
Wales along the lines of the licensing regime for firearms and shotguns. We consider that 
the measures set out below represent targeted action which will address the key risks 
without introducing additional administration and cost for police forces or air weapon users.</p>

<h4>Proposals following the review</h4>

<p>Given that the misuse of air weapons appears to occur disproportionately when young 
people are in possession, we intend to target the key risk of under-18s’ unsupervised 
possession of air weapons.</p>

<p>We propose to remove the exception that allows young persons who are at least 14 years 
of age to have unsupervised possession of air weapons on private premises.</p>

<p>We propose to strengthen and clarify the offence of failing to take ‘reasonable precautions’ 
so that whenever under-18s are on the premises, ‘reasonable precautions’ must include 
locking the air weapon out of sight when not in use and storing the ammunition separately.
We do not propose to require that air weapons are stored in a gun cabinet.</p>

<p>Additionally, we propose to work with industry to improve the safe keeping and handling of 
air weapons, to ensure that home security devices, such as securicords, are supplied with 
all new air weapons, to help minimise the risk of misuse; and to ensure that dealers 
explain the importance of secure handling and storage to purchasers of new air weapons
in person, at the point of sale, particularly in relation to access by under-18s.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>Q6. To what extent do you agree that the Government should remove the exception 
that permits unsupervised possession of air weapons by under-18s on private land?</p>

<p>Q7. To what extent do you agree that the Government should clarify the offence of 
failing to take ‘reasonable precautions’ to prevent minors from having air weapons 
so that whenever under-18s are on the premises, ‘reasonable precautions’ must 
include locking the air weapon out of sight when not in use and storing the 
ammunition separately?</p>

<p>Q8. To what extent do you agree that the Government should work with industry to 
improve the safe keeping and handling of air weapons, to ensure that home security 
devices are supplied with all new air weapons; and that dealers should explain the 
importance of secure handling and storage to purchasers of new air weapons at the 
point of sale?</p>

including any comments on the costs and assumptions used in the impact 
assessment and any costs not included? (max 250 words)

<h3>Miniature rifle ranges</h3>

<h4>The legislation</h4>

<p>Section 11(4) of the Firearms Act 1968 specifies as follows:</p>

<p>‘’A person conducting or carrying on a miniature rifle range (whether for a rifle club or 
otherwise) or shooting gallery at which no firearms are used other than air weapons 
or miniature rifles not exceeding .23 inch calibre may, without holding a certificate, 
have in his possession, or purchase or acquire, such miniature rifles and ammunition 
suitable therefor; and any person may, without holding a certificate, use any such rifle 
and ammunition at such a range or gallery.’’</p>

<h4>How the miniature rifle range legislation is used</h4>

<p>Section 11(4) allows a person to run a rifle range or shooting gallery where only miniature 
rifles not exceeding .23 inch calibre or air weapons are used, without the need for a 
firearms licence. Additionally, members of the public do not need a firearms licence to 
shoot at such a range or gallery. The legislation has existed for many years and is widely 
used, particularly as a means of introducing those new to the sport since it enables a 
person to try shooting without having to apply for a firearm certificate or be a member of an 
approved target shooting club. The legislation is also relied on by many approved target 
shooting clubs because of the restrictions in place around the use of ‘guest days’, which 
are limited to 12 per year.</p>

<p>It is generally understood that the miniature rifle range provision is intended to apply to 
lower-powered, .22 rimfire guns. However, the legislation refers to ‘miniature rifles not 
exceeding .23 inch calibre’, which can therefore include more powerful weapons.</p>

<p>Some examples of how the section 11(4) provision is used are set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Around 200 small-bore rifle clubs and some Home Office approved shooting clubs 
rely on section 11(4) which can help bring in new members to the sport. 
For example, these premises are used by organisations such as the Scout 
Association and some schools.</li>
  <li>There are also a small number of:
    <ul>
      <li>sports centres running biathlon training/competitions;</li>
      <li>commercial ranges or activity centres offering target shooting experiences;</li>
      <li>temporary ranges at shows, for example, game fairs;</li>
      <li>gun shops and armourers with ranges;</li>
      <li>shooting training organisations;</li>
      <li>pubs with bell target or tunnel ranges, and</li>
      <li>fairground shooting galleries (although nearly all now use air weapons).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Why legislative change is proposed</h4>

<p>During the passage of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019, amendments were tabled to 
abolish the section 11(4) exemption because of concerns raised by law enforcement. The Government undertook to consider the section 11(4) exemption as part of this
consultation.</p>

<p>The Government has sought preliminary views from law enforcement, including the 
National Police Chiefs Council, the National Crime Agency and the National Ballistics 
Intelligence Service. The concerns raised by law enforcement officers centre on the risk to 
public safety because the legislation allows a person to buy and possess firearms without 
having undergone any form of police check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no police suitability check is required for the operator of the miniature rifle range or 
members of the public shooting on the range;</li>
  <li>the operator of the miniature rifle range can purchase miniature rifles and 
ammunition from a registered firearms dealer without being legally required to 
produce evidence of why the guns and ammunition are being obtained;</li>
  <li>there is no legal requirement for the operator of the range to store the guns securely 
or to inform police of the existence of the firearms, their number or location.</li>
</ul>

<p>The police believe this presents a loophole in the legislation which criminals or terrorists 
could use to obtain guns, including self-loading firearms which can be fired rapidly and 
potentially result in large numbers of casualties. The view of law enforcement is that this 
part of firearms legislation is out of step with our otherwise robust firearms controls. 
Furthermore, while the legislation prohibiting those with convictions from possessing 
firearms<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> applies to operators and users of miniature rifle ranges, there is no requirement 
for a check of their status.</p>

<p>In contrast to the absence of oversight applying under section 11(4), the police firearms 
licensing system requires members of the public who otherwise wish to possess .22 rimfire 
guns to be subject to stringent suitability checks, including criminal record, counter-terrorism and medical checks. The firearms must be stored securely and be accessible 
only by the certificate holder, and the police visit the applicant and inspect the storage 
facilities prior to the initial grant.</p>

<h4>Proposals for change</h4>

<p>The Government is proposing to amend the section 11(4) exemption to bring in improved 
controls to address the issues which have been raised about the risk to public safety. In 
doing so, the provision for miniature rifle ranges will remain.</p>

<p>The intention is to retain the benefits which the section 11(4) exemption provides, while 
improving the controls so that police checks and approval are required for a person 
operating a miniature rifle range. We also intend to make clear in the legislation that a 
‘miniature rifle’ means a .22 rimfire gun so that more powerful and dangerous firearms are 
explicitly excluded.</p>

<p>The Government proposals are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A person who wishes to operate a miniature rifle range must apply for a firearm 
certificate and specify the rifles they wish to acquire. They must undergo the 
necessary suitability checks, including criminal records, counter-terrorism and 
medical checks.</li>
  <li>The miniature rifle range operator will be visited by the police who will check that 
the security arrangements for the firearms are sufficient. A firearm certificate 
granted to the operator of a miniature rifle range will specify security requirements 
relating to the firearms to ensure they are stored safely and securely.</li>
  <li>Operating a miniature rifle range will be among the ‘good reasons’ which police can 
take into account when assessing an application for a firearm certificate.</li>
  <li>Unsuitable persons who intend to operate a miniature rifle range, such as those 
who have been refused a firearm or shotgun certificate or whose certificate has 
been revoked on suitability grounds, will not be able to use the exemption to avoid 
proper scrutiny.</li>
  <li>Firearms legislation will specify that only .22 rimfire guns may be regarded as 
miniature rifles.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>Q10. To what extent do you agree that a person should be required to obtain a 
firearm certificate in order to operate a miniature rifle range?</p>

<p>Q11. To what extent do you agree that only rifles not exceeding .22 rimfire should 
be considered as miniature rifles for the purposes of the provision?</p>

<p>Q12. To what extent do you agree that self-loading .22 rimfire rifles should not be 
considered miniature rifles for the purposes of the provision?</p>

miniature rifle ranges, including any comments on the costs and assumptions used

<h3>Ammunition</h3>

<p>This section invites views on whether the controls on component parts of ammunition 
remain adequate or whether the possession of component parts of ammunition with intent 
to manufacture unauthorised quantities of complete rounds of ammunition should be made 
an offence.</p>

<h4>The issue</h4>

<p>Law enforcement has raised concerns that component parts of ammunition are too easy to 
obtain and are being used by criminals to unlawfully manufacture complete rounds of 
ammunition.</p>

<h4>The legislation</h4>

<p>The key components of ammunition are the propellant and primer. The propellant helps to 
propel a projectile from a firearm by burning rapidly, while a primer consists of an 
explosive chemical compound that ignites the propellant. The remaining components are 
the cartridge case and the projectile.</p>

<p>The possession of propellant is controlled under the Explosives Regulations 2014, which 
require that, with certain exceptions, anyone wanting to acquire or keep explosives must 
hold an explosives certificate issued by the police.</p>

<p>Primers are subject to control under section 35 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 
which makes it an offence to sell or purchase primers, including empty cartridge cases 
incorporating primers, unless the purchaser is authorised to possess them – for example, 
by being a registered firearms dealer or by holding a firearm certificate authorising them to 
possess a firearm or ammunition of the relevant kind. The maximum penalty for an 
offence is 6 months imprisonment.</p>

<p>It is an offence under section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968 to possess, purchase or acquire 
ammunition to which the section applies without holding a firearm certificate. The 
maximum penalty is 7 years imprisonment (where the offence is committed in an 
aggravated form), or 10 years in the case of prohibited ammunition. It is an offence under 
section 5(2A) of the Firearms Act 1968 to unlawfully manufacture and supply prohibited 
ammunition, with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>Q14. To what extent do you consider that the possession of component parts of 
ammunition with intent to manufacture unauthorised quantities of complete rounds 
of ammunition should be made an offence?</p>
