<p>Fill in your responses to the questions and email the form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:validation@dhsc.gov.uk">validation@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Read the background on the policy and legislation in this document and use the questions here only for reference. This is not an online form.</p>
</div>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>On 28 July 2021, legislation came into force which introduced validation for antigen and molecular coronavirus (COVID-19) detection tests. The statutory instrument made under the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 requires antigen and molecular COVID-19 tests to undergo mandatory desktop review to assess their performance before being permitted for sale on the UK market.</p>

<p>The government also intends to introduce a second statutory instrument in the autumn which will add mandatory laboratory validation to the current desktop review for COVID-19 tests. This will ensure that any COVID-19 test on the UK market meets a minimum standard – the same standards as those met by COVID-19 tests procured for the NHS.</p>

<p>This call for evidence aims to support our understanding of the wider internal market, individual business and trade flow impacts underpinning the government’s policy on introducing mandatory validation for antigen and molecular COVID-19 detection tests. This will be reflected in the next iteration of the economic impact assessment for this policy.</p>

<p>The impact assessment is a crucial part of the policy development process and considers the likely impacts that different policy options may have based on the evidence available. To ensure the impact assessment we complete includes the best possible research and evidence available, we are inviting stakeholders to submit evidence on some key areas.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/private-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-validation">current iteration impact assessment</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to this call for evidence, we will also launch a full public consultation which will seek views on the government’s proposals to introduce mandatory laboratory validation for COVID-19 detection tests. Respondents are welcome to respond to both documents, however please note that the call for evidence is more targeted on obtaining specific evidence in relation to businesses operating in the COVID-19 diagnostics market, whereas the consultation will more broadly seek views on the government’s proposals to introduce laboratory validation.</p>

<p>In this call for evidence, we are seeking evidence and opinions on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>costs for individual businesses involved in the domestic COVID-19 test kit sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scale and nature of domestic COVID-19 test kit activity, including manufacturing and trading</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scale and nature of activities abroad which are integral to our existing domestic COVID-19 test kit supply and market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the direction of the COVID-19 test kit market</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The results of this call for evidence will help to shape the policy and the resultant analysis will be published in the impact assessment underpinning the policy.</p>

<h2>Privacy notice</h2>

<p>The questions forming part of this review include requests for information which may be commercially sensitive. Such information will be used by the Department of Health and Social Care for the purposes of this impact assessment only. However, no commercially sensitive information will be published in the impact assessment itself. Any personal data (for example, names and email addresses) provided to the Department of Health and Social Care as a result of responding to the questions below will be processed in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-privacy-notice"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s privacy notice</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We want to build our understanding of the economics of the COVID 19 testing market in the UK. To do this we need more information about both the broad strokes of supply and demand dynamics as well as the fine detail of business costs and individual behaviour around testing.</p>

<p>This call for evidence seeks substantive submissions from all interested stakeholders. We would welcome submissions of both analysis and underlying calculations and evidence. We welcome submissions on any or all of the below broad areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>costs for individual businesses involved in the domestic COVID-19 test kit sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scale and nature of domestic COVID-19 test kit activity including manufacturing and trading</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scale and nature of activities abroad which are integral to our existing domestic COVID-19 test kit supply and market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the direction of the COVID-19 test kit market</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have also set out some more specific questions to help guide respondents so that your submissions will be easy for you to structure and will add maximum value to our policy development and analysis. These are set out at high level here and in more detail in the call for evidence questions below. Submissions may focus on any individual question or cover them all.</p>

<h2>How to respond</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We invite you to submit written responses via email. Respond by downloading the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-covid-19-device-product-market-call-for-evidence">UK market for COVID-19 detection devices: call for evidence template</a> in OpenDocument (ODT) or MS Word Document format.</p>

<p>Fill in your responses to the questions and email the form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:validation@dhsc.gov.uk">validation@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Read the background on the policy and legislation in this document and use the questions here only for reference. This is not an online form.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the call for evidence, we are also planning to launch a full public consultation which seeks views on the government’s proposals to introduce mandatory laboratory validation for COVID-19 detection tests.</p>

<p>The full public consultation will provide individuals and organisations with the opportunity to feedback on the government’s proposals and the potential to shape the policy. This is separate from the call for evidence, which seeks specific evidence to support the impact assessment.</p>

<h2>Background on the policy and legislation</h2>

<h3>Legislation</h3>

<p>On 28 July 2021, it became a legal requirement to seek UK government validation for antigen and molecular COVID-19 detection tests intended for sale on the UK market.</p>

<p>The Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (made under the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021) will ensure that COVID-19 detection test products available for purchase on the UK market meet a minimum performance standard and consumers can have confidence in the performance of the tests they purchase. Those tests that do not pass the validation assessment and meet a minimum performance threshold will not be legal for sale in the UK. The government will publish a register of tests that have passed validation to make it easy for consumers to make informed choices about the tests they purchase.</p>

<h3>Validation stage 1: desktop review</h3>

<p>The desktop review is intended to prevent products that are below the minimum standards from progressing to the market as set out in the Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>The desktop review is an assessment of the evidence a manufacturer or distributor submits to support the performance of their product. Applicants will be required to submit information related to the following areas for basic checks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>manufacturer and product information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regulatory status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>product performance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>biosafety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supplementary documents (for example, current versions of the instructions for use, biosafety documents, evidence of performance characteristic)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The desktop review assessment is then completed in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>a scientific adviser reviews evidence provided by the applicant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Desktop Review Assurance Group assesses this review and makes a recommendation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Regulatory Approvals Committee then considers it</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Read more detailed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-test-approval-how-to-apply">guidance on the process of applying for desktop review</a>.</p>

<h3>Validation stage 2: laboratory validation</h3>

<p>In the autumn, the government intends to introduce a second statutory instrument which will introduce mandatory laboratory validation (in addition to desktop review) for COVID-19 tests. This will ensure that any COVID-19 test on the UK market meets a minimum standard, the same standards as those met by COVID-19 tests procured for the NHS and is fit-for-purpose.</p>

<p>Laboratory validation will involve independently testing the performance of a coronavirus test product in a central laboratory against a specific set of criteria.</p>

<p>On the assumption the test already meets certain criteria in terms of intended purpose and use, the test product will be subject to a validation process in a central laboratory, which will assess the following performance characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>analytical sensitivity (limits of detection and linearity of the assay)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analytical specificity (interference by, and cross-reactivity with, other pathogens)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (accuracy of performance with clinical samples)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This will happen in up to 3 stages. Products completing all stages will have completed laboratory validation against the required set of samples in line with <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> recommendations.</p>

<p>We recognise extensive validation has already taken place for many test products on the UK market. Where our scientific advisers are satisfied this evidence presented in support of the test is of sufficiently high quality, we will rely on it to avoid any duplication and overly burdensome regulation. We would still expect to conduct a laboratory validation of these test products but with a minimal number of samples to test in order to ensure that the evidence claims from existing validation could be replicated to an appropriate degree.</p>

<h2>Demographic questions</h2>

<h2>Call for evidence questions</h2>

<p>Below are a number of detailed questions to help guide your responses and highlight the evidence we are most interested in receiving. The answer to these questions will more closely align with our analytical needs and the specific policy issues where we want to build our underlying understanding.</p>

<h3>Costs to business: familiarisation and transition costs</h3>

<p>We invite manufacturers and retailers of COVID-19 tests to respond to the questions within this section.</p>

<p>It is important that we understand as much as possible about the impact the legislation introducing mandatory validation for COVID-19 detection tests has on business. Your feedback on the following questions will help us give a more representative estimate and help us to account for the costs associated with different sized businesses.</p>

<p>We are interested in understanding the familiarisation and transition costs for manufacturers and retailers impacted by this legislation. In this case, the familiarisation and transition costs refer to the costs incurred as a result of familiarising and transitioning into the new mandatory validation regime for COVID-19 tests.</p>

<p>We have assessed the tasks we believe that manufacturers and retailers will need to take in order to transition into the new system.</p>

<p>We would like to ask you to provide your assessment or estimate (or both) on the questions below.</p>

<p>For each activity, please estimate the time taken and cost per hour. You should take into account the level of seniority and level of pay of the employee who would take responsibility for these tasks. If there are multiple employees undertaking a task, please reflect this in the hours taken.</p>

<p>Please also identify whether you would undertake these activities in house, or contract these services out.</p>

<p>To answer these questions, please enter this information as far as possible with your best estimates.</p>

<p>Please skip the section that is not relevant to you.</p>

<h3>Understanding the market</h3>

<p>We invite stakeholders involved in the manufacture or distribution of COVID-19 or other diagnostic tests, academics and experts in the diagnostics industry to respond to the questions within this section.</p>

<p>We are interested in understanding more about the structure and investment within the COVID-19 diagnostics market. Specifically, we are seeking evidence relating to a number of areas including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the life cycle of a COVID-19 detection test product</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the investment that companies make in meeting new regulations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an estimate of the profit margins in COVID-19 testing and how they might be impacted by the new regulation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the size, volume and value of the COVID-19 test market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>potential impacts upon supply chains</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Product life cycle</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>What is the average life cycle for your product or products or a COVID-19 diagnostic device?</p>

<p>How would this vary by technology type? For instance, how long would a device last for before manufacturers decide to update or make substantive changes to their product (for example due to innovation, market competition or new variants)?</p>
</div>

<h4>Investment and profits</h4>

<p>We are interested in finding out how much it costs for manufacturers to make improvements to their products.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Can you estimate how much it would cost, on average, to modify a COVID-19 detection test in the following 3 scenarios:</p>

<ul>

    <p>re-work of manufacturing process or packaging that does not have regulatory impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>re-work of manufacturing process or packaging that does have regulatory impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change to the test construction (for example chemistry or packaging)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>What would be the most likely scenario if a COVID-19 test product failed validation?</p>

<ul>
  <li>product is discontinued and exit the market</li>
  <li>redesign and resubmit for validation</li>
  <li>seek alternative international markets</li>
  <li>other (please specify):</li>
</ul>

<p>How would this vary by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technology type</li>
  <li>country of origin</li>
  <li>size of revenue</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">

</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>How much would you estimate that it costs to bring a new product to market? Please outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial cost</li>
  <li>amount of time taken to bring a product to market</li>

<p>How would this vary by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technology type</li>
  <li>country of origin</li>
  <li>size of revenue</li>
</ul>

<p>(For example, a company could find new work to replace the contract lost.)</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>What proportion of your supply chain is UK-based?</p>
</div>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>We will analyse the responses we receive to this call for evidence and this will directly feed into the development of the impact assessment for the policy introducing validation for COVID-19 tests. When we are satisfied that we have collated the best evidence, we will submit a full impact assessment to the Regulatory Policy Committee for their review.</p>

<p>In addition, we will shortly launch a full public consultation which seeks views on the government’s policy proposals to introduce a second statutory instrument in the autumn to introduce mandatory laboratory validation for COVID-19 detection tests.</p>

<p>The full public consultation will provide individuals and organisations with the opportunity to feedback on the government’s proposals and the potential to shape the policy. This is separate from the call for evidence, which seeks specific evidence to support the impact assessment.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding to this call for evidence.</p>
