<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>During its passage through Parliament, the government made several changes to the now Building Safety Act 2022 to protect qualifying leaseholders in buildings above 11m or 5 storeys from the costs of remediating their buildings.</p>

<p>The government made the decision that the leaseholder protection provisions in Part 5 of the Act would not apply to leaseholder-owned and commonhold buildings. This was because leaseholders, in their capacity as freeholders would still have had to pay to remedy the safety defects in their buildings.</p>

<p>This call for evidence is seeking information on leaseholder-owned buildings above 11m or 5 storeys with relevant defects. This will help inform government policy in determining how best to protect the leaseholders in such buildings from the impact of building safety defects.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>During its passage through Parliament, the government made several changes to the now Building Safety Act 2022 to protect <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/30/section/119/enacted" rel="external">qualifying leaseholders</a> in buildings above 11 metres or 5 storeys from incurring excessive service charges by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring developers are on the hook for fixing their own buildings (both cladding and non-cladding defects), and only where they cannot be traced will building owners and leaseholders (subject to contribution caps for qualifying leaseholders) be required to pay for remediation works in their building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extending the limitation period for claims brought under section 1 of the Defective Premises 1972 retrospectively (i.e. for work already completed) from 6 to 30 years meaning that claims can be brought for work that was completed up to 30 years prior to the 28 June 2022. The limitation period has also been extended prospectively (i.e. for work completed in the future) from 6 to 15 years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expanding the type of work that is subject to the duty under the Defective Premises Act 1972.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This means that developers, building owners and landlords are now the first port of call to pay for meeting the cost of remedying non-cladding safety defects, not leaseholders. We have been clear that we want those responsible for defective buildings to pay the bulk of costs for remediation, where the defect was incurred during the building’s construction, or because of works carried out to it, within the last thirty years, which has impacted upon the fire and structural safety of the building (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/30/section/120/enacted" rel="external">section 120 for the definition of “relevant defect” in the Building Safety Act 2022</a>).</p>

<p>The Building Safety Act 2022 received Royal Assent on 28 April 2022 and the leaseholder protection provisions came into effect on 28 June 2022 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/30/section/170/enacted" rel="external">section 170(3) of the Act</a>). This ensures that no qualifying leaseholder in a building taller than 11 metres or 5 storeys will face bills to remediate unsafe cladding, and their bills for non-cladding remediation work will be capped, with many leaseholders paying nothing at all.</p>

<h3>Leaseholder-owned buildings</h3>

<p>The government is committed to transforming the experience of leaseholders by making it easier and cheaper for them to extend their lease, buy their freehold and take control of the management of their buildings.</p>

<p>The government made the decision that the leaseholder protection provisions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/30/part/5/enacted" rel="external">Part 5 of the Building Safety Act 2022</a> would not apply to leaseholder-owned and commonhold buildings. This was because leaseholders, in their capacity as freeholders rather than as leaseholders, would still have had to pay to remedy the safety defects in their building.</p>

<p>The financial burden would have been worse in circumstances where some leaseholders collectively enfranchised, and others had not. The enfranchised leaseholders may have had to pay for remediation of the whole building, in their capacity as owners of the freehold, including the share of remediation costs that would otherwise have been recoverable from those leaseholders who had not enfranchised, once they have paid up to the cap. This would have created the perverse situation where the leaseholder protections resulted in an increase in liability for those leaseholders who had chosen to collectively enfranchise.</p>

<p>The Building Safety Act 2022 provides other routes for redress (which also apply to leaseholder-owned buildings) for buildings with relevant defects, enabling interested parties to pursue those directly responsible for defects through the courts. This is now available for longer, and in a far greater range of circumstances, including a cause of action relating to product manufacturers and the provisions enabling associated companies to be sued.</p>

<p>In April 2022, the Minister for Housing announced that the government would consult on how best leaseholder-owned and commonhold buildings can be protected from the costs associated with building safety defects.</p>

<p>Before we can come forward with our proposals, we need to better understand the types of relevant defects present in leaseholder-owned buildings. We are initially seeking to collect data on leaseholder-owned buildings that are above 11 metres<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> or 5 storeys including collecting information on any relevant defects that may also be present in these buildings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Leaseholder-owned blocks</h2>

<p>The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) is seeking to gather data on the number of buildings with the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the building is above 11 metres or 5 storeys in height and located in England; and</li>
  <li>the freehold to the building is held by some, or all, of its leaseholders.</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes buildings where leaseholders have exercised their right to collectively enfranchise.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span> ‘Unsafe’ cladding systems</h2>

<h3>Private sector ACM (Aluminium Composite Material) cladding remediation fund</h3>

<p>On 9 May 2019 it was announced that the government would fully fund the removal and replacement of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-sector-acm-cladding-remediation-fund-prospectus">unsafe ACM cladding on private sector residential buildings 18 metres or over</a>, with costs estimated at £200 million.</p>

<p>The private sector ACM cladding remediation fund was available to private sector 18 metres and over buildings with cladding systems which were identified as containing combustible materials (e.g. a polyethylene core in an aluminium composite panel) and which failed the series of BS8414 tests commissioned by the government over summer</p>

<h3>Building Safety Fund</h3>

<p>In the March 2020 budget, the government announced that it would provide £1 billion in 2020 to 2021 to support the remediation of unsafe non-ACM cladding systems on residential buildings that were 18 metres and over in both the private and social housing sectors.</p>

<p>On 26 May 2020, the Department published the registration prospectus. The registration process that opened following publication of the prospectus closed on 31 July 2020.</p>

<p>On 17 December 2020, the Department announced the extension of the closing date for applications to the Building Safety Fund until 30 June 2021 with the start on site date moving to 30 September 2021.The Building Safety Fund was available to 18 metres and over buildings where cladding, insulation or filler materials were present that did not meet specific criteria when tested in accordance with BS EN 13501. The detailed definitions of cladding, insulation and filler materials are set out in Annex A to the Building Safety Fund prospectus.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-safety-fund-guidance-for-new-applications-from-july-2022">Building Safety Fund was reopened on 28 July 2022</a> for new applications from responsible entities of private or social sector buildings that meet the following criteria:</p>
