<h2>Section 1: Overview of this consultation</h2>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>1.1 &nbsp; This consultation seeks your views on a new Statutory Instrument (SI), the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Regulations 2023 (‘the proposed Regulations’). The proposed Regulations would replace the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2950) and the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection: Large Ships) Regulations (SI 1998/1012) in order to implement the most up to date requirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS) affecting fire protection, contained in Chapter II-2 of the Annex to SOLAS (Fire Protection, Fire Detection and Fire Extinction).</p>

<p>1.2 &nbsp; The main objective of the proposed Regulations is to improve further the safety standards for fire protection on ships. The proposed Regulations will also include an ambulatory reference provision to ensure future amendments to Chapter II-2 of SOLAS referred to in the proposed Regulations are given direct effect in UK law. A more detailed explanation of what this means can be found in section 2.3 of this document.</p>

<p>1.3 &nbsp; The updated requirements to Chapter II-2 of SOLAS agreed at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and which the proposed Regulations seek to implement, include amendments to requirements for existing ships (those constructed before 1st July 2012) and new ships (those constructed on or after 1st July 2012).</p>

<p>1.4 &nbsp; Further details on all the updates being implemented by the proposed Regulations can be found in section 2.6.</p>

<h3>Views sought</h3>

<p>1.5 &nbsp; Consultees are invited to comment on any aspect of this consultation; however, you are specifically invited to respond to the consultation questions in section 5.1. A more in-depth explanation of the areas for consideration can be found in section 2.</p>

<p>1.6 &nbsp; A full list of consultation questions is contained in section 5 of this document.</p>

<h3>Deadline for responses</h3>

<p>1.7 &nbsp; Responses are welcomed from 18th July 2022 until 12th September 2022.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Areas for consideration</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>2.1 &nbsp; SOLAS Chapter II-2 contains provision for (structural) fire protection, fire detection and fire extinction on ships.  This includes, for example, prevention of fire and explosion, suppression of fire, escape from fire, operational requirements, alternative design and arrangements and other requirements which are specific to particular situations. SOLAS Chapter II-2 is supplemented by the Fire Safety Systems (FSS) Code and the Fire Testing Procedures (FTP) Code. All are amended from time to time in the IMO. There are a number of amendments which have been agreed in the IMO and which have come into force internationally since UK law was last updated in 2003 by the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2950).</p>

<p>Amendments contained in 20 resolutions have been agreed at the IMO since 2003 to further improve the safety standards of fire protection, but which have not yet been implemented into UK law. The UK supported these amendments during IMO discussions and, as a party to SOLAS, the UK now has an obligation to implement these further updates.</p>

<p>Amendments made to SOLAS Chapter II-2 in relation to existing ships (those constructed before 1st July 2012) include provision for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fitting fire detection and suppression on cabin balconies or fitting detection and restricted fire risk furniture and surfaces on balconies;</li>
  <li>adding another valve to the CO2 flooding fire suppression system, for tanker ships to carry an oxygen measuring meter and a portable gas detector;</li>
  <li>adding an audible alarm and a visual or other device to the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) of fire fighters’ outfits as well as including a minimum of two two-way portable radiotelephone apparatus for fire fighters’ communication;</li>
  <li>introducing a water mist lance capable of penetrating a container wall and producing water mist inside a confined space on ships that carry containers above the weather deck; and</li>
  <li>container ships that are designed to carry five or more tiers of containers on or above the weather deck to carry mobile water monitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes will be implemented in the proposed Regulations.</p>

<p>Amendments to SOLAS Chapter II-2, introduced for new ships (constructed on or after 1st July 2012) include provision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to increase the amount of sulphur dioxide allowed to be produced by carpets;</li>
  <li>to introduce a requirement for a safety centre on board;</li>
  <li>to add scuppers from spaces above or on the bulkhead deck;</li>
  <li>to ensure scuppers cannot become blocked and to ensure sufficient pumping and drainage capacity for those located below the bulkhead deck;</li>
  <li>to require tankers to have a fixed hydrocarbon gas detection system;</li>
  <li>to require an evacuation analysis for ro-ro passengers ships and other ships carrying more than 36 passengers; and</li>
  <li>to remove the fire regulation exemptions for UK class XI and XII vessels.</li>
</ul>

<p>These updates will be implemented in the proposed Regulations.</p>

<p>The proposed Regulations will revoke and replace the existing implementing Regulations - the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection: Large Ships) Regulations (SI 1998/1012) and the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2950) - in order to update the legislation. The Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection: Small Ships) Regulations (SI 1998/1011), which implement requirements in Chapter II-2 relating to the carriage of dangerous goods on smaller ships, will be amended to a very limited extent. This will improve the safety standards for seafarers, passengers and operators of passenger vessels on international voyages and all cargo vessels of 500GT and over on international voyages.</p>

<p>Merchant Shipping Notice 1900 (M) contains the technical requirements for ships constructed before 1st July 2002 that were previously contained in the Large Ships Regulations. Some ships within this category are subject to different requirements and these are set out in regulation 13 of the proposed Regulations and in the accompanying Merchant Shipping Notices. In particular, although the requirements for ships constructed before 26th May 1965 will not change in the new Regulations, they are now expressly contained in regulation 13 and in Merchant Shipping Notice 1670 (M).</p>

<p>2.2 &nbsp; The amendments to SOLAS affecting fire protection comprise a mix of updates, clarifications and improvements to layout, as well as several important substantive changes to the safety measures. These substantive changes are listed in paragraph 2.6. As the requirements for fire protection in SOLAS are implemented in UK law, intervention is necessary to implement these amendments so that the changes can also be reflected in UK law, and any benefits that they represent can be made available to UK industry.</p>

<p>2.3 &nbsp; The proposed Regulations include an ambulatory reference provision. This is a reference in domestic legislation to an international instrument (or part of it) which is interpreted as a reference to the international instrument as modified from time to time (and not simply the version of the instrument that exists at the time the domestic legislation is made). From a legal perspective, this will mean that any new amendments to provisions in SOLAS Chapter II-2, and other Chapters of SOLAS that are referenced in the domestic implementing legislation will automatically become UK law when they enter into force internationally. No new or amending regulations will be required to bring these amendments into force in the UK, as is currently the case. From a practical perspective, this means that ship owners, shipbuilders and other interested parties can refer directly to the text of SOLAS Chapter II-2 to determine both the domestic and international requirements. Where the international text is unclear or needs amplification - for instance, where it states that something is done ‘to the satisfaction of the administration’ - guidance will provide the additional clarity required.</p>

<h3>Application of the Regulations</h3>

<p>2.4 &nbsp; The proposed Regulations apply to all passenger vessels on international and non-international voyages (except for passenger ships operating solely in internal waters) and all cargo vessels of 500GT and over on international and non-international voyages, with some limited exceptions</p>

<h3>Proposed Changes</h3>

<p>2.5 &nbsp; The purpose of the amendments is to maintain a high standard of safety and to remove barriers to trade by ensuring a consistent standard of safety for fire protection on ships.</p>

<h3>Summary of Options and Recommendation</h3>

<p>2.7 &nbsp; As the proposed costs are below the £5m threshold per annum cost or benefit to business and the changes are non-contentious and non-controversial, the proposal is subject to a De Minimis Assessment (DMA).</p>

<p>2.8 &nbsp; The following options were considered:</p>

<p>&nbsp; - Option 0. Do nothing. This option is not viable as it would mean UK flagged vessels would have a lower standard of fire protection safety requirements than their international counterparts and would also be in contravention of the UK’s international obligations, agreed in the IMO. The existing rules for fire protection for ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002 are implemented in the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2950) and, for ships constructed before 1st July 2002, in the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection: Large Ships) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/1012). There have been substantive updates made to Chapter II-2 of SOLAS since 2003 and, as such, the UK regulations are up to 18 years out of date in some places. The majority of the substantive changes took place after 2008; however, this still leaves UK legislation 13 years out of date with other international rules for fire protection.</p>

<p>&nbsp; - Option 1. Revoke and replace SI 1998/1012 and SI 2003/2950 and include an ambulatory reference provision. This option will provide a greater standard of safety for vessels and seafarers on UK and foreign flagged vessels operating in UK waters. This option will also satisfy the UK’s obligations as a signatory to SOLAS and bring UK legislation up to date and in line with its international counterparts. The inclusion of an ambulatory reference provision will enable UK industry to refer to the most up to date international legislation in this area (where referenced in the Regulations) and ensure that the Regulations remain up to date with the requirements for fire protection in SOLAS. Supporting documentation will be provided by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to add clarification and additional guidance where the regulations are, or could be, ambiguous, especially where the international text allows the administration to exercise discretion, e.g.: where Chapter II-2 states that an obligation must be performed “to the satisfaction of the administration”, the MCA will specify what is required to meet this obligation. This will mainly fall on internationally operated vessels.</p>

<p>The inclusion of an ambulatory reference provision does not remove the opportunity to ensure scrutiny of proposed changes and to provide notice of updates. All amendments to the Convention are developed and agreed at the IMO, where, in addition to Member States, industry is well represented. Industry is therefore heavily involved with policy development and also in helping to shape the UK’s negotiating position. Working in partnership, UK officials and industry actively contribute to negotiations on new initiatives to ensure they are appropriate and proportionate measures to improve safety.</p>

<p>&nbsp; - We have discounted non-regulatory alternatives, as this would not be an effective means of ensuring fire safety standards in a global industry. Neither would it satisfy our obligation as a party to SOLAS to implement and enforce these international requirements.</p>

<p>2.9 &nbsp; The preferred option is Option 1</p>

<h3>Supporting Information</h3>

<p>2.10 &nbsp; Marine Notices:</p>

<p>It is intended to publish three Merchant Shipping Notices (MSN 1900, 1901 and 1902) and two Marine Guidance Notes (MGN 666 and 667) to support the new Regulations (attached to this document as Annexes B - F) as well as issue amendments to six Merchant Shipping Notices (MSN 1665, 1666, 1667, 1668, 1669 and 1670) (attached to this document as Annexes G - L). All the Merchant Shipping Notices contain requirements that will be made mandatory by the proposed Regulations. As indicated above, MSN 1900 (M) contains the technical requirements for ships constructed before 1st July 2002 that were previously contained in the Large Ships Regulations.</p>

<p>2.11 &nbsp; Offences and Penalties</p>

<p>The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), as the UK’s maritime regulatory and enforcement authority, has responsibility for both delivering and enforcing the Government’s maritime policy relating to ships, seafarers and the seas around the UK. The MCA’s approach to breaches of maritime legislation relies on a range of civil and criminal remedies which, like in many other regulatory regimes in the UK, sit alongside each other to enable the MCA to take the most proportionate action in relation to a particular breach. The decision on what is the most proportionate approach is determined by matters such as the importance of the requirement being breached, the gravity of the contravention, the effect of the contravention on third parties etc.</p>

<p>MCA surveyors have enforcement and sanction powers which can be applied locally to ships calling at UK ports. The MCA’s powers to use civil sanctions are primarily contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (‘the Act’). These powers, including improvement and prohibition notices, are available only for specific purposes. Other than the power to detain a ship, it is not possible to replicate all the civil sanctions in the Act in secondary legislation implementing international obligations or other policy objectives as there is no power to do so in the Act. Because these civil sanctions are contained in primary legislation, if they are needed, the sanctions will be enforced directly under the Act. The general policy approach, in line with the MCA’s published enforcement policy, is to use these civil sanctions whenever possible before using criminal offences.</p>

<p>Maritime regulatory requirements govern both safety and pollution prevention. As such, their purpose includes the prevention of loss of life or injury to persons and the protection of the marine environment and adjoining coastlines. These very compelling objectives necessitate the availability of criminal sanctions in the more serious cases, and also provide a vital deterrent. For these reasons, criminal offences are included in the proposed Regulations. The offences and penalties that currently exist in relation to Chapter II-2 have been reviewed and this included the target parties for each offence. It is considered that all existing offences are still required, as they are still necessary as a deterrent and a proportionate means of achieving the necessary end, but no new offences are necessary. The offences are detailed in the table below.</p>
