<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Intellectual property (<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>) is vital to the UK economy: between 2017 and 2018, investment in intangible assets grew by 3.3% to an estimated £169.2 billion. This was greater than the total tangible investment in 2018, which fell 3.9% to £151.0 billion. Use of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> has been linked with an increase in firm performance, with ownership of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> rights (IPRs) being strongly associated with improved economic performance at firm level.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The UK starts from a position of strength, ranked 4th in the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organization’s">WIPO</abbr>) Global Innovation Index 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and 2nd in the US Chamber of Commerce Global Innovation Policy Centre (GIPC) International <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> Index 2022.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> Our <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> system is consistently highly regarded around the world.</p>

<p>However, the UK <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> system’s ability to keep pace with technological change is central to our continued high performance. The digital sector plays an important role in the UK economy, contributing £150.6bn in 2019, accounting for 7.6% of UK gross value added, representing an increase of 6.1% from 2018.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>We have seen the extensive rise in the use of wireless technologies (3G, 4G, 5G,   Wi-Fi, etc.) in telecommunications and the automotive industry (for example, providing in-vehicle and inter-vehicle connectivity and in navigation systems). This in turn has seen increased attention given to issues surrounding the licensing of patents and use of standards.</p>

<h3>The role of technical standards and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> in technology sectors</h3>

<p>A technical standard is an agreed or established description of a technical process or task that is shared with others to promote interoperability of systems or convergence of practice in an industry. These are usually produced by Standard Development Organisations (<abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, established for the purpose of creating standards, with inputs from industry and technical experts. Trade bodies, government organisations and similar entities can also create technical standards. The importance of standards is growing with the increasing globalisation of commerce, the emergence of new technologies and the need for interoperability.</p>

<p>Technical interoperability standards are increasingly relied upon to enable components developed by different manufacturers, to be able to seamlessly ‘talk to’ each other. They are particularly important in technologies which allow us to communicate, to receive and store ever larger quantities of data, and&nbsp;efficiently access or stream content online&nbsp;e.g.,&nbsp;music files or high-definition video streams. In new markets, we have seen the requirement for products including digital, the automotive sector and the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

<p>Standards, like patents, can span across multiple disciplines and sectors. In some cases, standards require the use of specific technologies protected by patents. A patent that protects technology which is essential to implementing a standard is known as a standard essential patent (<abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>). Without using the methods or devices protected by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, it is impossible for a manufacturer (or implementer of the standard) to create standard compliant products, such as smartphones or tablets.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> have IPR policies in place that ensure <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders provide a licence to implementers of the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>) terms. Without such an obligation, a single patent holder could refuse to license and prevent companies from implementing the standard.</p>

<p>The number of declared <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> doubled on average every five years between the early 1990s to 2014<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. As of 2020, around 95,000 patents had been declared essential for the 5G standard.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> The IoT sector had 7.6 billion active IoT devices at the end of 2019, a figure predicted to grow substantially over the next 10 years.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Diversification of the telecoms landscape</h3>

<p>In November 2020 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy">Government’s Telecoms Diversification Strategy</a> made a number of recommendations to encourage new vendors into the market, including sunsetting (phasing out) legacy networks, encouraging new technologies and funding research and development (R&amp;D). It also commissioned the Diversification Taskforce which reported in April 2021. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/telecoms-diversification-taskforce-findings-and-report">Taskforce</a> noted that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> had the potential to serve as considerable barriers to diversification and recommended some actions for the government to consider.</p>

<p>Resolving these issues is central to enabling effective and sustainable diversification of the telecoms supply chain, leading to greater competition and innovation. Increasing transparency and access to patent portfolios may improve how the market operates. The Diversification Strategy seeks evidence to better understand how transparency can improve market functioning and whether there are inefficiencies that need to be tackled. This call for evidence will complement work already under way as part of the Diversification Strategy.</p>

<h3>International context</h3>

<p>The UK recognises the need to ensure our own domestic legislative and policy frameworks keep pace with global developments and challenges for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing . An effective global ecosystem is key to enabling innovative business and technologies to thrive. Overcoming the current challenges of the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> framework requires global collaboration to reflect the fact that business is global. The United States, European Union and Japan have recently considered or continue to consider policies relating to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. The UK will consider which issues will be best served through collaboration with our international partners.</p>

<h3>Responses to the Call for Views</h3>

<p>The IPO published its Call for Views on 7 December 2021 running for 12 weeks and closed on 1 March 2022. In that time, the IPO held virtual roundtables with various stakeholder groups including <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, implementers, legal &amp; academic organisations and sector &amp; innovation networks over a 3-week period between 28 January 2022 and 15 February 2022.</p>

<p>The aim of the stakeholder roundtables was to provide industry with an overview of the Call for Views publication and to invite a discussion relating to themes within the publication, particularly on competition &amp; market functioning, transparency in the system, and the patent licensing &amp; litigation frameworks.</p>

<p>The IPO received a total of 56 written responses from a variety of stakeholder groups to a total of 27 questions across 6 broad themes. This publication summarises the responses to each question thematically. The summary involves a necessary abbreviation of was submitted. Some respondents chose to group their responses to different questions in one place. Where helpful we have sometimes grouped our summary of responses to reflect this and to avoid duplication. All views reported are those of respondents and should not be taken as the views of the IPO.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Relationship between Standard Essential Patents, innovation, and competition</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 1.</strong></p>

<p>How does the SEPs ecosystem work effectively in a balanced way to support competition and innovation?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Many responded to this introductory question by setting out their broad position on the question of change. The different themes in the responses were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>the benefits of a balanced ecosystem.</strong> Various respondents said that a balanced ecosystem is essential to support competition and innovation</li>
  <li>
<strong>the benefits of standardisation for competition and innovation.</strong> Some respondents said standardisation, FRAND terms and the Horizontal Guidelines work well to support competition and innovation</li>
  <li>
<strong>no change</strong>. Some said no change is needed, as there is no evidence of a problem</li>
  <li>
<strong>balance favours the implementer.</strong> Some responded that there is little incentive on implementers to agree a license, so SEP holders need protections such as the availability of injunctions</li>
  <li>
<strong>SEPs ecosystem works well, with some challenges, either for SEP holders or implementers.</strong> Issues raised included availability of SEP licenses; appropriate royalty rates; SME involvement in standards development; hold-up, hold-out; transparency of FRAND rates and conditions; and over-declaration of patents to a standard</li>
  <li>
<strong>balance favours the SEP holder.</strong> Some responded that SEP holders use market power, court decisions to 
determine global rates, and levels of litigation to disadvantage implementers</li>
  <li>
<strong>view on the UK Government’s role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem.</strong> Some said that the UK should develop a policy framework and stay active in international forums to help maintain a balanced framework</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>The benefits of a balanced ecosystem</h3>

<p>1.1.
Some respondents suggested that a balanced ecosystem is essential without commenting as to whether the current balance was right. A balanced ecosystem would provide standard developers the incentive to innovate, while providing implementers access to standardised technologies.</p>

<h3>The benefits of standardisation for competition and innovation</h3>

<p>1.2.
Some respondents, mostly <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, suggested that standardisation has sped up the progress of innovation and competition, particularly in the mobile communications sector. One <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder explained the rate of technology development in this space is a result of the intense competitive nature of the standardisation process in combination with co-operation between companies to develop the standard. Another respondent added that standards are important enablers of competition and innovation in sectors that require interoperability.   Respondents stated that without the presence of a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem, competition and innovation would be limited to proprietary systems resulting in a slower rate of progress compared to what is seen today.</p>

<p>1.3.
<abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders said that <abbr title="European Telecommunications Standard Institute">ETSI’s</abbr> (the European Telecommunications Standard Institute) <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>  policy and the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> framework has been integral to the speed at which innovation and competition has grown in this context.       One <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder explained that <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing has been ‘a main pillar’ of the ecosystem and that the framework provided by the Court of Justice of the European Union (<abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr>) in Huawei v ZTE effectively balances the interests of both implementers and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders.  In the Huawei decision the <abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr> set out a number of steps that should be followed in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>  licensing negotiations.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> A legal representative added that <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> declarations allow <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> to agree a standard knowing that it may be implemented and that licences would be available. They added, competition is enhanced by <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> declarations, allowing implementers to enter markets before licences have been agreed.</p>

<p>1.4.
One <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder stated The Horizontal Guidelines’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>approach to <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing supports the balance of incentivising <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to develop new technologies and the wider adoption of standardised technology by implementers. They said this strikes the right balance to promote innovation and competition.</p>

<p>1.9.
 A legal representative stated that enabling <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to enforce their rights is an important part of the ecosystem and supports innovation by ensuring contributors are fairly paid for their technology. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder stated that isolated <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> disputes between implementers and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, even if publicised, do not result in any negative effects on competition.</p>

<p>1.6.
Some responses touched on royalty free licensing and open innovation. One respondent suggested that allowing different licensing models, including royalty bearing and royalty free licences, is consistent with competition policy. They added that royalty free licensing is an important driver for innovation and competition and that reciprocal licensing on royalty free terms is pro-competitive. A consultancy referred to a study that looked at the interplay of open innovation and <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>They found that for many small-to-medium enterprises (<abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>) in the IoT, blockchain and software-based ecosystems, other <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> forms, such as copyright or trade secrets, may have been more of a priority over patents.</p>

<p>1.7.
Some respondents said that the current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem did not require any fundamental changes. One respondent stated that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> intensive technology sectors do not show any form of market failure that requires regulatory intervention as a matter of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> or competition law. Another respondent added that UK initiatives should be cautious to not undermine current incentives. One respondent, a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder, stated that there is no empirical evidence to demonstrate that there are systematic problems to be addressed. On the other hand, some respondents stated that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem does not effectively work in a balanced way to support competition.</p>

<h3>Balance of the ecosystem favours the implementer</h3>

<p>1.8.
Two respondents stated that the balance of the current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem favours the implementer. To illustrate this, they suggested that implementers are in an advantageous position regarding open access to standards. They say that there is little incentive for some implementers to negotiate and conclude <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences in a timely manner. One respondent added that injunctions are a necessary component of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing. They further remarked that obtaining damages would leave <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders far from the position they would have been in had licences been concluded in a timely manner and in good faith. They also stated that a lack of diversity in the telecoms supply chain points to an imbalance in the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem works well, with some challenges</h3>

<p>1.9.
Some respondents were generally positive about the current state of the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem but stated challenges could be addressed to enable the ecosystem to better support competition and innovation. Those challenges include availability of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences for all, what constitutes a reasonable royalty rate, limited SME involvement in standards development, hold-up<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>, hold-out<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>, a lack of transparency of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates and conditions and over-declaration of patents to a standard.</p>

<h3>Balance of the ecosystem favours the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder</h3>

<p>1.10.
Some respondents, mostly implementers, suggested that the balance of the current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem favours the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder. To support this, one respondent stated that the UK Supreme Court’s decision in Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>, which set a precedent for global portfolio licences, sharply tilted the balance in favour of the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and claims that this decision makes the UK a less attractive place for innovation.</p>

<p>1.11.
The same respondent added that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders are improperly leveraging their market power to force licensees to pay excessive licensing fees. Therefore, encouraging hold-up. Another respondent added that this has competition concerns as there is the potential to reduce price competition and exclude or discriminate against certain companies by preventing access to a standard. Further, one respondent added that individual royalty payments are a restricting factor in their innovation process. One respondent added that the current ecosystem does not provide sufficient safeguards against hold-up or hold-out. One respondent pointed towards a lack of competition in standard development, stating that contributions to 5G standards are dominated by a few companies (with 75% of total made by 9 companies) and regional balance is poor. They also added that ownership of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> is similarly concentrated, claiming that  approximately two thirds of all <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are owned by 7 companies.</p>

<p>1.12.
Another respondent said that the SME community is concerned that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem is becoming increasingly litigious. They added that there are concerns that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders are reneging on their voluntary <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments. A respondent stated that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers have not been able to find a consensus on a common industry licensing model for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Views on the UK Government’s role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem</h3>

<p>1.13.
Some respondents stated that the UK Government has a role to play in striving for a balanced <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem. One respondent stated that the UK should develop a policy framework that guarantees the sustainability of the voluntary, inclusive, collaborative and consensus-based ecosystem that fosters standardised technologies. Another respondent added that the UK should stay active in international policy forums regarding <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> policy to strive for an ecosystem capable of enabling licensing negotiations and dispute resolution in a timely and efficient manner.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 2.</strong></p>

<p>What actions or interventions would make the greatest improvements for consumers in the UK?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Many SEP holders, and some others, responded to this introductory question by arguing for no change or no change without careful consideration. Some SEP holders and many implementers made specific proposals for change, which are expanded on in responses to other questions. The different themes in the responses were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>benefits to consumers of a balanced ecosystem.</strong> Various respondents said an ecosystem that looks after the interests of all parties would be of greatest benefit to consumers</li>
  <li>
<strong>benefits to consumers of the current system.</strong>. Some said the incentives for innovation offered by the current patent system benefits consumers. SEP holders need to be able to enforce their rights</li>
  <li>
<strong>no change, or no change without careful consideration.</strong> Some that should be no change; others said that any intervention should be carefully considered</li>
  <li>
<strong>greater transparency and increased competition.</strong> Some respondents said greater transparency about SEP licences would indirectly benefit consumers. Increased competition and a larger supplier base would benefit consumers</li>
  <li>
<strong>FRAND licensing.</strong> Some said changes within the current FRAND licensing regime would benefit consumers.These included addressing hold-up and hold-out</li>
  <li>
<strong>patent pools.</strong> Some respondents said that patent pools could bring benefits for consumers but multiple patent pools for the same standard could be damaging</li>
  <li>
<strong>regulatory investigations.</strong> Some responded that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) should investigate “anti-trust” and consumer issues and have increased powers to investigate licensing</li>
  <li>
<strong>SDOs.</strong> One respondent said SDOs may be better placed to deal with SEP licensing issues, with government guidance</li>
  <li>
<strong>consult consumers.</strong> Some respondents said consumers’ views should be more central to the policy debate</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Benefits to consumers of a balanced <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem</h3>

<p>1.14.
Several respondents, from a variety of stakeholder groups, stated that consumers would benefit from a balanced <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem that looks after the interests of all parties within the ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Benefits to consumers of the current system</h3>

<p>1.15.
Some respondents stated that the current system is working well.  A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder said that retaining the current approach is ideal. If the UK’s position is imbalanced one way or another it may diminish the industry’s incentive to innovate. Therefore consumers may lose the benefits of efficient and effective standardisation. Another <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder explained that the current framework is successful as it has fostered open ecosystems that drive innovation, promote competition, and facilitate interconnectivity. This would ultimately allow consumers to benefit from improved performance, choice, and price. Some respondents suggested that consumers would benefit from a wider adoption of standards in new markets where standards do not currently exist.</p>

<p>1.16.
Two <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders argued that improvements for consumers would come from continuing to provide incentives for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to make investments in R&amp;D. One respondent added that this could be enabled by allowing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to enforce their rights should infringement take place, ultimately giving rights holders assurances that they can collect <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties to recoup their initial investment. The same respondent added that if companies are not able to enforce their rights, there may be fewer technical solutions available and less consumer choice. The other <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder, argued that an environment that supports R&amp;D requires a robust <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> system and appropriate court procedures, suggesting that these are in the consumer interest.</p>

<p>1.17.
Another two <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, stated that the current retained competition law framework related to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing should remain as the guidance that the UK should follow. They added that if the UK decides to follow a more restrictive approach to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders’ rights, their incentive to innovate may decrease. This would impact the availability and variability of technologies for the end consumer.</p>

<h3>No change, or no change without careful consideration</h3>

<p>1.18.
Seven respondents said that there are no changes needed at this time. A further eleven respondents said that any future intervention should be carefully considered, and evidence led.</p>

<h3>Greater transparency and increased competition</h3>

<p>1.19.
Some respondents suggested that greater transparency over prices related to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences would benefit consumers . One respondent stated that publishing proposed royalty fees could allow competition between standards and ultimately reduce the cost to the consumer. Some respondents added that publishing sales data for a given patent portfolio or having the necessary information to value a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolio would help. Some respondents said that greater transparency over whether a patent is essential to a standard could indirectly benefit the consumer. One respondent added that a transparent licensing regime is essential for the development of IoT innovations. Some respondents stated that consumers would benefit from legislation leading to a more transparent licensing regime.</p>

<p>1.20.
A trade association , pointed toward introducing greater competition into the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem. They said that for network operators to sustain providing complex telecom services at reasonable prices, they require a larger supplier base of competing manufacturers that offer compatible products under the same standard.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing</h3>

<p>1.21.
One respondent said that greater legal certainty in the determination of a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence will likely reduce legal costs, ultimately reducing costs for the end consumer. Some respondents stated that <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences should be available to anyone who wants to implement a standard. One respondent stated that the availability of fully licensed connectivity modules would reduce cost uncertainty for businesses as well as reducing transaction costs for implementers. One respondent stated that enforcing <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms among <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holding companies would make improvements for consumers. Various respondents suggested that if issues related to hold-up or hold-out remain unaddressed, it may have an impact on the end consumer. One respondent stated that implementers should have responsibilities to demonstrate ‘willingness’ to take a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence. Some respondents argued for UK guidelines on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing.</p>

<h3>Patent pools</h3>

<p>1.22.
Patent pools are defined as an agreement between two or more parties to license one or more of their patents to one another or to third parties<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. One respondent stated that a more coherent patent offering in this context would be beneficial. They were in favour of patent pools, which they said can promote market uptake. However, they said multiple pool offerings for the same standard may be damaging for the uptake of technologies and for the consumer. A licensing administrator stated that support from UK legislators for independent licensing platforms would benefit consumers and the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<h3>Regulatory investigations</h3>

<p>1.23. 
An academic stated that the CMA should investigate anti-trust and consumer issues in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> intensive industries. Another respondent, added that the CMA (and other relevant regulators) should have increased powers to investigate licensing practices. They suggested that a strong regulatory regime can act as a deterrent to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders abusing any market power.</p>

<h3>A role for <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing</h3>

<p>1.24.
A legal representative stated that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, rather than Governments, may be better placed to deal with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing issues if provided with regulatory guidance. They added that mechanisms should be introduced at the SDO level to value <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolios.</p>

<h3>Consult consumers</h3>

<p>1.25.
One respondent stated that there is a need to conduct further research on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> from a consumer perspective. They added that it would be beneficial to better include consumers in the debate. Further, some respondents stated that UK consumers’ interest should be central to the policy debate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Competition and market functioning</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 3.</strong></p>

<p>In your view, are there issues in respect of market power in markets using SEPs? Examples are particularly sought on practices that create difficulties for industry or act as barriers to innovators.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4.</strong></p>

<p>Are you aware of evidence of circumstances where an implementer of a SEP is required to buy licences to a wider patent portfolio that is not relevant to the standard or component to which the SEP relates? Are there effective ways of resolving such issues?</p>

<p><strong>Question 5.</strong></p>

<p>Does the competition law framework impact the provisions in agreements between SEP owners in practice? If so, how does it do this? Is there room for improvement in order to better benefit and encourage competition and innovation?</p>

<p><strong>Question 6.</strong></p>

<p>In your view, what actions or steps can be taken to encourage competition and innovation in the SEPs ecosystem?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Responses to these questions showed very different views from SEP holders and implementers. Both groups provided evidence in support of their arguments and there were few areas of agreement. The different themes in the responses were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>market power and hold-up.</strong> Differing views on whether SEP holders exercise market power obtained through inclusion of their patents in a standard to charge excessive royalties (‘hold-up’), and whether intervention is needed</li>
  <li>
<strong>market power and hold-out.</strong> Differing views on whether implementers engage in strategies to delay agreement of a FRAND license (‘hold-out’), and whether intervention is needed</li>
  <li>
<strong>barriers to entry and market exclusion.</strong> Some implementers pointed to difficulty obtaining licenses from SEP holders due to refusal to license at certain points in the value chain, which they claimed has deterred market entry</li>
  <li>
<strong>global licensing of SEPs.</strong> Responses presented differing views on court-ordered global licenses, including the precedent set by Unwired Planet v Huawei</li>
  <li>
<strong>requiring licences to a wider patent portfolio that is not relevant to the standard or component to which the SEP relates.</strong> Some responses provided court case evidence of licensed portfolios containing unused, invalid or non-essential patents, and discussed what they saw as harmful effects on competition and innovation</li>
  <li>
<strong>competition law framework.</strong> Differing views on whether competition guidelines provide sufficient clarity on FRAND determination and other SEP-related competition matters, and whether more prescriptive guidance is needed</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Market power and hold-up</h3>

<p>2.1. 
Market power is defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as ‘the ability of a firm (or group of firms) to raise and maintain price above the level that would prevail under competition. The exercise of market power leads to reduced output and loss of economic welfare’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>Some responded that there are no issues in respect of market power in markets using <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. Respondents pointed to successful market functioning evidenced by rapid increase in adoption of standardised technologies, particularly in the wireless communications sector.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> Respondents also noted success in other performance indicators, such as time-to-market, access to technology, and technical performance, and suggested these outcomes would not be expected under conditions of market power being exercised.</p>

<p>2.2.
Some responded that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders are unable to exercise the market power derived from incorporation of their technology within a standard because they commit to license at a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate. Several responses cited the Huawei v ZTE case<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>, setting a precedent that courts in England and Wales will not grant an injunction unless a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder first offers an implementer a licence on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms.</p>

<p>2.3.
As evidence that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders do not charge excessive royalties (‘hold-up’), some respondents pointed to declining royalty rates over time. An academic pointed to a fall in quality-adjusted prices in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>-intensive device markets, and a consultancy firm pointed to declining aggregate royalties paid for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences by smartphone manufacturers since 2013, remaining in modest single-digit percentages. An industry body compared prices of Apple and Samsung devices with and without cellular functionality, finding that value added from cellular standards exceeded royalties paid. Respondents also pointed more generally to a lack of empirical evidence in support of hold-up. One respondent stated that patent pools have helped to mitigate hold-up, as shown by a reasonable level of marketplace acceptance of patent pool royalty rates by implementers.</p>

<p>2.4.
On the other hand, most implementers, and some other stakeholders responded that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders exercise market power conferred by inclusion of their patented technology to a standard to engage in so-called ‘hold-up’. This term is used to refer to the practice where a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder demands an excessive licence fee above a fair and reasonable rate. Evidence is provided of court cases where royalties demanded by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders far exceed adjudicated <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>, sometimes by more than 200 times<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. A trade body responded that <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms should be based on the economic value of the patented technology and not the market success of end products, nor the value of inclusion in the standard. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and an implementer suggested the development of a specialist tribunal or board to make a public determination on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates and terms on a case-by-case basis. For further views, see section 5 on licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.5.
Some suggested requiring the publication of price lists for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> or disclosing comparable <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences in a partially redacted form, based on which potential licensees could properly assess the offer they receive, reducing risk of hold-up. One implementer suggested this could require government guidance encouraging the publication and dissemination of licensing terms by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Another suggested this could involve publishing upper limits for <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates to allow for benchmarking. Further discussion of transparency is included in section 3.</p>

<p>2.6.
Many implementers responded that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders use injunction threats to coerce prospective licensees into accepting non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing terms, to avoid removal of their products from the market. One implementer responded that almost half of the 48 UK businesses they surveyed with experience in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing between November 2021 and February 2022 would accept or likely accept non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms to avoid risks of injunctions. Consequently, some responded that the granting of injunctions should be prohibited except in ‘exceptional circumstances’, including where payment of damages is refused, and where an infringer is demonstrably unwilling to enter a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence. Two implementers responded that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> should follow IEEE’s (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) lead by updating their IPR policy to clarify that injunctions should only be available in rare circumstances, pointing to evidence that this increased productivity and innovation. For further views on injunctions, see section 4 on patent infringement and remedies.</p>

<p>2.7.
Implementers gave examples of other actions by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders that they alleged constituted abuse of market power. One implementer responded that a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder had unlawfully seized products at customs to pressure the implementer into accepting an allegedly non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> license, resulting in millions of pounds worth of losses.    It stated that the granting of custom seizures should be prohibited except in exceptional circumstances where damages would not be an adequate remedy.</p>

<p>2.8.
Others pointed to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders requiring implementers to sign overly restrictive Non-Disclosure Agreements (<abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr>). One implementer responded that this reduces price transparency and therefore potential for price competition. Another responded that overly restrictive <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr> prevent potential licensees from checking with suppliers whether patent rights have been exhausted. Exhaustion is defined by the US Supreme Court as occurring when “a patented item’s initial authorized sale terminates all patent rights to that item”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>. Exhaustion therefore prevents a licensor from repeated future attempts to extract royalties following the sale of a licence, meaning the downstream purchaser of a component is immune to patent claims seeking to extract royalties if the supplier has already taken a licence. Consequently, several responses suggest excessive use of <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr> should be limited. For further views on transparency and <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr>, see section 3 on transparency in the system.</p>

<h3>Market Power and hold-out</h3>

<p>2.9.
Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and other stakeholders responded that the power to influence prices<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing negotiations instead lies in favour of implementers, who they claimed engage in so-called ‘hold-out’. This term is used to refer to an implementer that delays agreeing a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> license in order to escape payment of royalties or to pressure the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder to agree a lower license fee than may be fair or reasonable. One licensing administrator responded that hold-out has worsened in recent years, pointing to a study that found the licensing rate in telecoms has fallen from 73% to 39% 2006-2016<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>. Many responded that availability of injunctive relief should remain to allow <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to enforce their rights to mitigate hold-out and recoup innovation costs. Furthermore, some responded that the changes made to US SDO, IEEE’s IPR policy in 2015 to limit injunctive relief should not be replicated by other <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, to avoid incentivising hold-out.</p>

<p>2.10.
Examples of use of hold-out strategies by implementers are given in responses, with one providing reference to court case evidence. These include ignoring communications from <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders for months or years without filing a counter-offer<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> insistence on patent-by-patent, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction litigation of large <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolios, conditioning payment of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders offering bundles of patents (including patents not bound by the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment), and insistence on obtaining unreasonable amounts of information, such as a claim chart for every <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> in a portfolio<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>, among others. One industry body responded that vagueness of the European Commission’s notion of a ‘willing licensee’ may have encouraged a hold-out strategy where companies merely claim to be ‘willing’ to take a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence while their behaviour in negotiations suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>2.11.
Some respondents identified disparity in economic resources between <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers as a cause of unbalanced bargaining power<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup> in negotiations. One compared sub-billion operating profits of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, Nokia and Ericsson, to multi-billion operating profits of implementers, Apple and Samsung, over 2017 to 2020, stating that this should concern policymakers, and that it reflects that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders do not have the upper hand. Others also pointed to significant resources held by digital implementers being channelled into lobbying.</p>

<p>2.12
Several <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders responded with observations of competition issues between implementers associated with hold-out, including that implementers engaged in hold-out gain an undue competitive advantage over their good-faith licensed competitors, allowing them to unfairly gain market share. Furthermore, one <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder said that implementers engaged in hold-out access confidential licensing information of their competitors when enforcement actions are brought, due to the discovery processes used by courts, adding to their competitive advantage.</p>

<p>2.13
One legal services firm responded that current access to injunctions is insufficient for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to be able to enforce their rights, and that a more streamlined, less fragmented, less costly and binding way of resolving disputes should be found. This was seconded by a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder that called for a more accessible and effective system of patent enforcement, following the example set by the UK High Court. Further discussion of these frameworks is included in section 6 on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation. One licensing administrator responded that it had acted to reduce hold-out risk by offering incentive discount programs for implementers willing to agree a licence within a reasonable time after first implementation of standard-compliant products. It suggested this program could be replicated by other licensors.</p>

<h3>Barriers to entry and market exclusion</h3>

<p>2.14.
Several <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders responded that the current system of open standardisation is the best way of disseminating standardised technology. One <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder responded that open standards ensure “everyone has access” to standardised technology. Section 5 on licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> discusses <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders’ responses regarding licensing at different points in the value chain<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>, with some responding that to offer licences at all points would introduce unnecessary complexity and administrative burden.</p>

<p>2.15.
Other responses questioned accessibility. They said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders were abusing their market power by refusing licences to willing licensees higher in the value chain (e.g. upstream component suppliers), raising competition law concerns. One  responded that this is a concern particularly where a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder is vertically integrated, as it can leverage its market power to foreclose competition in the downstream market. Other responses pointed to adverse effects on innovation, and that upstream suppliers are deterred from finding new uses for standardised technology in markets where they cannot obtain licence. One implementer responded that refusing licences to upstream suppliers could delay the adoption of IoT, as whilst component suppliers are unable to obtain licences to indemnify their customers for patent infringement, companies seeking to develop innovative products based on components face uncertainty regarding their exposure to infringement claims. Consequently, many responded that licences to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> should be made available to anyone requesting a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> license, irrespective of their position in the value chain. For further views, see section 5 on licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.16.
One consultancy firm responded that there appear to be agreements between some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders at similar levels in the value chain not to license each other, so that they can then together seek to license at different, higher priced levels in the value chain. They responded that this is a potential competition issue warranting further investigation.</p>

<h3>Global licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>2.17.
Several responses commented on global licences, referring to the recent case of Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup>, where the UK Supreme Court’s judgement included for the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owner to offer to licence its portfolio of declared <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders responded that global portfolio licensing is the best way to overcome uncertainty over which patents in a portfolio are infringed by an implementer. One industry body responded that, when consensual, licensing patent portfolios can achieve efficiencies of scale.  A legal services body, responded that a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder will often adjust the royalty rate down for licensees that are unlikely to use the full portfolio, making the practice fairer. Some responded that any issues with portfolio licensing are currently resolved through negotiation between licensee and licensor.</p>

<p>2.18.
Some responded that under the precedent set by Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup>, a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder need only prove the merits of a single claim of a UK patent without detailed examination of whether any of the other patents in a global licence are infringed, valid, enforceable or essential. On responded that this may deter some from operating in the UK. Others responded that this could create an issue of forum shopping, defined by one court as “the practice of choosing the most favourable jurisdiction… in which a claim might be heard”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>. Responses suggested <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders may find it most favourable to take their cases to UK courts following the outcome of Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>2.19.
Some suggested essentiality checks be required within all <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolios, alongside legislative action such as reform of the UK Patent Act to remove the precedent of global portfolio licensing set by Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>.  An industry body suggested <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should be required to provide more detailed information to prove the essentiality of patents in their portfolio. Some responded that implementers should be allowed to make validity, essentiality and infringement challenges without being considered ‘unwilling’ to take a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> license. For further views on global licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, see section 4 on patent infringement and remedies.</p>

<h3>Requiring licences to a wider patent portfolio that is not relevant to the standard or component to which the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> relates</h3>

<p>2.20.
Most <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders responded that they were not aware of evidence of circumstances where an implementer of a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> is required to buy licences to a wider patent portfolio that is not relevant to the standard or component to which the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> relates. Were such circumstances to arise, one legal services firm responded that implementers can refuse to enter such a licence, or litigate.</p>

<p>2.21.
Some used the terms ‘tying’ and ‘bundling’ in their responses. A European Commission discussion paper<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> defines ‘tying’ as occurring “when the sale of a product is conditioned to another transaction. An individual or a company agrees to sell the product only if its purchaser agrees to acquire another product”. It defines bundling as occurring “when a set of several products is sold in one sole ‘package’”. A UK legal services firm responded that only tying is incompatible with competition law, whilst bundling is less problematic as it does not include an element of compulsion. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and a licensing administrator responded that non-consensual tying or bundling of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> with non-essential patents may amount to a breach of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (<abbr title="Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union">TFEU</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>2.22. Many implementers and industry bodies responded that licensing of portfolios containing expired patents or valid but unused patents   is concerning when it is non-consensual. Two examples were given in relation to mobile connectivity, and another in relation to MPEG video encoding/decoding. Several responses referenced a study that found just 11% of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> asserted during the period 2013-2017 were valid and infringed<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup>. An industry body suggested <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders provide multiple modes of binding licences to improve <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensee choices. An industry body responded that a legislative framework prohibiting requirements to license a wider patent portfolio that isn’t relevant to the standard could resolve these issues.</p>

<p>2.23.
Several implementers and industry bodies responded that they had observed the licensing of portfolios of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> containing non-essential patents. One industry body responded that this practice occurs ‘routinely’, because it proves an impossible task for a potential licensee to assess and litigate every patent in a given portfolio. An industry body gave an example of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> reading to different standards (smartphones and smart vehicles) being licensed under the same portfolio, forcing implementers to license patents not essential to their product. Many others responded that over-declaration of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> in licensed portfolios unfairly increases royalty rates, as implementers are forced to pay for non-essential patents. Two implementers responded that this detracts from funds available for innovation in end-user products and can be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices. Several referenced a study that found 50-90% of self-declared <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> to be non-essential, based on court case evidence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup>. One responded that bundling and tying strategies are used by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to mask and inflate the independent value of a their individual <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, supporting a higher royalty demand that is unreasonable.</p>

<p>2.24.
One responded that legislation should prohibit alleged bundling and tying strategies, which they defined as including (i) requiring portfolio or sub-portfolio licences; (ii) requiring combined licences of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and non-essential patents; (iii) requiring customers to license <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and/or other patents as a condition to purchasing products or services in which the licensor has market power or a monopoly, and (iv) requiring the purchase of its products or services as a condition to obtaining a licence to some or all of its <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Competition Law Framework</h3>

<p>2.25. 
An industry body  responded that the Horizontal Guidelines<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup> are correct in guiding that when participation in standard development is open and the process transparent, standardisation agreements usually will not restrict competition. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder responded that additional guidance on bilateral licensing is unnecessary given the clear framework provided by Huawei v ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup>, and given bilateral licensing is not a cooperation agreement. Some responded that flexibility should be maintained in guidance, as more prescriptive guidance on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> could encourage potential licensees to assert compliance failures by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners as a reason to delay negotiations of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences. These responses do not call for any changes to be made to the Horizontal Guidelines or any other aspect of the competition law framework.</p>

<p>2.26.
On the other hand, five implementers and one industry responded that the Horizontal Guidelines lack clarity on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing matters. Some responded that little guidance is given on what the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment entails and how parties should arrive at <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms, with ambiguities leading to excessive royalties being charged by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, refusals to license, and more licensing disputes. These responses urged a revising of the guidelines to offer more legal certainty. Several responses pointed to success of the 2015 IEEE policy update in providing clarity on the availability of injunctive relief for IEEE standards and setting out the recommended principles for valuation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Transparency in the system</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 7.</strong></p>

<p>Is there sufficient transparency around how patents are being declared as essential to the standard? What actions do industry, including SDOs undertake to ensure essentiality is understood?</p>

<p><strong>Question 8.</strong></p>

<p>Are you aware of instances of under-declaration or over-declaration and what issues does this create for markets using SEPs?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Both SEP holders and implementers related the issue of over-declaration and under-declaration to SDO policies. However, responses from SEP holders and implementers tended to differ on the extent to which they saw over-declaration as a problem. Relatively few respondents commented on under-declaration. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>transparency of the declaration process</strong>. Some said there was sufficient transparency within SDOs or that the negotiation process provided transparency. Others said that there was not sufficient transparency and that this was a particular problem for SMEs</li>
  <li>
<strong>proposals to improve transparency and understanding of declaration</strong>. Examples included education programmes and changes to SDO IPR policies and responsibilities</li>
  <li>
<strong>relationship between declarations and SDO rules</strong>. Various respondents said that so called over-declaration or under-declaration are consequences of SDO IPR policies</li>
  <li>
<strong>over-declaration</strong>. Many respondents said there were high levels of over-declaration. There were differing views on the extent to which over-declaration is a problem</li>
  <li>
<strong>under-declaration</strong>. Some respondents said under-declaration is no longer a problem, while others said it can be a cause for concern</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Whether there is sufficient transparency of the declaration process itself.</h3>

<p>3.1.
Several respondents stated that the declaration process itself is sufficiently transparent and well understood. Some said that there is sufficient transparency within a few <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> such as ETSI and the current declaration requirements are sufficient to ensure that the standard can be implemented at a reasonable cost without it being blocked by a patent owner. Some respondents said that there are already sufficient resources that provide information on how declaration works. One respondent argued that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> offer educational materials on standards, including essentiality.</p>

<p>3.2.
In addition, two respondents stated that the current ETSI database is generally recognised as being of superior quality compared to those of other <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>. One respondent suggested that <abbr title="European Telecommunications Standard Institute">ETSI’s</abbr> process of declarations, where specific patents and paragraphs of relevant standards are identified, assists transparency, and could be followed by other <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.3. 
One respondent argued that the challenge in ensuring that essentiality is understood by a list of “checked” <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> would go beyond the scope of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> and that there is already a market that provides for landscaping studies and essentiality checks.   Another respondent stated that to require <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> to be responsible for determining essentiality would be disruptive to their fundamental purpose of developing standards. One said that a number of factors present limitations to perfect transparency such as costs and the constantly evolving nature of the standard.</p>

<p>3.4.
Some respondents said sufficient transparency was provided through the negotiation process.   One respondent said that because of the way in which negotiations between implementers and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners tend to proceed in telecoms, i.e., by reference to claim charts produced for the purposes of technical discussions on essentiality, they do not consider that any lack of transparency on the basis for a declaration of essentiality will give rise to meaningful difficulties in licensing discussions. A respondent referred to Huawei v. ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup> and   stated that both parties are required to place sufficient information before the other to conduct an arms’ length negotiation.</p>

<p>3.5.
On the other hand, many respondents, stated that there is a lack of transparency, and the process is opaque, particularly for <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. One respondent stated that improved transparency is desirable if additional information is sufficiently accurate and unbiased. In addition, another respondent said that declaration requirements through SDO policies are not adequate to foster transparency in the system. One respondent stated that SDO’s try to mitigate the lack of transparency through their IPR policies. However, this is not consistently applied or sufficient.</p>

<p>3.6.
Some responses also touched on issues relating to the independence or impartiality of the process of self-declaration which are further discussed below under the heading on who should carry out essentiality checks.</p>

<h3>Proposals to improve transparency and understanding of declaration</h3>

<p>3.7.
Several responses included proposals for how transparency or understanding of the declaration process could be improved, either by changes to the IPR policies or responsibilities of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, or by government action.</p>

<p>3.8.
Some respondents argued that transparency could be improved by updating IPR policies or otherwise imposing requirements for more specific declarations Some respondents said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should be required to confirm what they claim the relevant <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> covers, for example referencing the portion of the standard or contribution to which the disclosure relates to. One respondent said that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> should have to approve such a declaration. Another stated that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should have to produce an independent essentiality claim chart which could be made publicly available at the SDO. One respondent argued that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners should be required to update their declaration where a court has determined that the patent in question is invalid or not truly essential to the standard. Another respondent suggested that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could provide clarity through further definition of what is meant by “<abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>” in a specific context, for example whether it includes technically essential patents or only those which are commercially essential.</p>

<p>3.9.
Some respondents argued for broader changes to SDO responsibilities. One respondent recommended that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could strengthen their guidelines for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> declarations, including providing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> certification services and introducing third-party agencies to ensure the reliability and transparency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> declarations.  Another respondent recommended that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could establish a ‘board of experts’ having specific expertise in the relevant field which may help potential licensees obtain information on essentiality.</p>

<p>3.10.
Some respondents said government could increase transparency through endorsement and education. One respondent stated that there is information available which would benefit from being supported and endorsed by the UK Government, such as that provided by the LOT Network<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup>. Another respondent stated that transparency could be improved if the IPO, as well as <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> provided more information, education and guidance about standardisation of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and best practices for licensing aimed at sectors who are interested in implementing connectivity standards. One respondent stated that the UK Government should take more steps to participate in <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> and ensure participants are penalised if they fail to comply with the IPR policy.</p>

<h3>The relationship between declarations and SDO IPR policies</h3>

<p>3.11.
Several respondents related the issue of transparency to the objectives of IPR policies. They responded that the aim of IPR policies such as those of ETSI was not to establish essentiality or inform the licensing process. Rather it was to ensure at an early stage that licences will be available for the standard on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms in order to facilitate the process of standard development .</p>

<p>3.12.
Some responded that so called “over-declaration” or “under-declaration” are logical consequences of SDO IPR policies.  Some respondents said that there is an initial over-declaration due to e.g., the ETSI IPR policy obligation to declare potentially essential patents and applications. One respondent said that under the IEEE, the often-used “blanket declaration” means a de-facto under-declaration.</p>

<p>3.13.
Some respondents drew attention to the purpose of the declaration system in relation to over-declaration. One said the purpose of the declaration framework is to facilitate the development of the standard, not the licensing of patents. Two respondents further said the purpose of a declaration to an SDO is so that the SDO can be confident that the technical standard developed within it can be implemented in the market. These responded variously that there is a tendency to mischaracterise the purpose of the declaration system or that over-declaration can only really occur in <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> that impose a more detailed disclosure requirement on their members.</p>

<p>3.14.
One respondent said that the ETSI patents database, by its nature, is subject to significant over-declaration. They said that this is not a fault but a safeguard to ensure that all <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are available to license under <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> conditions.  Three respondents said that over disclosure is inherent in the rules of most <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>. However, one respondent said this is understood in the industry and accounted for. Problems only<a class="govuk-link" href="#_msocom_25">[JA25]</a>  arise where patent owners seek to influence licensing discussions by artificially inflating the apparent size of their portfolio through over-disclosure. Another said over-declaration becomes a problem when companies assert patents as <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> on basis of those declarations.</p>

<h3>Over-declaration</h3>

<p>3.15
Some respondents commented that over-declaration is not an issue and should not be a cause for concern. One respondent argued this is because the goal of linking disclosure with licensing declarations is to ensure access to the patents essential to a standard under <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms. One respondent stated the term “over-declaration” is widely misused, and it is not aware of instances of over-declaration. A few respondents said that those contributing technology to a standard are doing what is requested of them i.e., declaring patents that may become essential to a standard.  Another respondent said that existing approaches for disclosure of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and providing licensing commitments have been successful. Another respondent said that though some SDO policies encourage over-declaration, this is more useful than <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> that have no or little mandatory declaration requirements.</p>

<p>3.16.
However, several respondents reported there were high levels of over-declaration  with some providing figures or pointing to studies in support of this. One respondent said an estimated 75% of declared essential patents are not essential to the standard. A few respondents referred to studies analysing over-declaration. These respondents said the studies indicate the rates of declared patents actually being essential are 10-50%<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup>, 20-30%<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup>, and 42%<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup>. One of these respondents also pointed to another study saying this found 8% of declared patents in 5G were found to be essential<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup>. Another respondent pointed to a study reporting 50-80% of declared patents being found to be non-essential<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.17.
One respondent said there is clear evidence that participants in the standards development process at ETSI engage in significant over-declaration. This respondent pointed to the European Commission in a Call for Evidence that said “according to some experts, only about 25-40% of all declared <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are truly for a given standard”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup>. Another respondent stated that generally, over-declaration is more common in 4G/5G patents declared at ETSI. A respondent said companies that have business models where revenues are dependent on patent licensing are incentivised to over-declare.</p>

<p>3.18.
Respondents raised several concerns about the effects of over-declaration. One respondent said over-declaration creates uncertainty as to the number of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences that are required, reduces efficiency and accuracy of patent valuation methods based on patent counting, and increases the cost and time needed to establish standard essentiality of a patent portfolio. A few respondents said over-declaration could distort the market and prevent fair pricing of those patents which are truly essential. They suggested this risked impairing the take up of technology. Another respondent said that over-declaration creates hurdles to adoption and creates significant information asymmetry between the licensor and the licensee, affecting the licensee’s ability to negotiate. One respondent argued that over-declaration can have the effect of reallocating royalties to non-essential patents, which are not required to be licensed.  Others said that over-declaration reduces the credibility of standardisation.</p>

<p>3.19.
Several respondents said that challenging over-declared <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> leads to significant litigation costs which are not feasible for smaller companies, and which create barriers to market entry. They argued these challenges further decrease transparency and create uncertainty in the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> framework. One respondent said over declaration results in implementers using a <abbr title="Internet of Things">lot</abbr> of resources to analyse essentiality. The respondent said over-declaration may result in lengthy negotiations between the licensor and potential licensee and may lead to court proceedings.</p>

<p>3.20.
One implementer said there should be no presumption that just because a patent has been declared essential, that it is in fact essential or that it has been subject to any good faith evaluation. Another respondent said over-declaration is a problem when the ‘top down’ method is used to determine <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates as the total number of essential patents used in this method is based on self-declarations. However, this respondent noted that in patent pools the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> that are part of the pools have had essentiality determined by an expert.</p>

<h3>Under-declaration</h3>

<p>3.21.
Several respondents stated that under-declaration concerns have reduced since the Rambus case<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup> in the US and EU. In the Rambus case, the patent holder participated in standard setting whilst being aware of patents essential to the standard but did not declare these patents. The patent holder  later asserted those patents against users of the standard. Two respondents said they were not aware  of any under-declaration taking place. One of these respondents, however, said late declaration is a problem, but one that should be dealt with by anti-patent ambush<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup> actions.</p>

<p>3.22.
On the other hand, one respondent said under-declaration would leave implementers unsure whether they would have access to standardised technology on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms and suggested that it would be advisable to continue to allow and even promote over-declaration. The respondent said under-declaration would lead to less certainty as to the potentially essential patents that exist and uncertainty as to the terms under which under-declared patents will be licensed, if at all. One respondent argued that  under-declaration can lead to ‘patent ambush’ and could mean that the patents are not covered by <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>.  The  respondent noted that under-declaration could become problematic if it led to the adoption of the standard without a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> declaration for such patent. One respondent said that under-declaration is more concerning than over-declaration.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 9.</strong></p>

<p>Would the introduction of an essentiality check service by an independent party improve licensing negotiations? Who would be the appropriate independent party to undertake essentiality checks?</p>

<p><strong>Question 10.</strong></p>

<p>How should an essentiality check take place? Should there be a level of legal certainty given to essentiality checks and assertions of essentiality by IPR holders? If so, how?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>While most respondents thought the independence of those carrying out essentiality check was important, there were differing views on whether an additional independent essentiality checking service needed to be provided. And many responses said legal certainty could only be provided by the courts. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>essentiality checks by an independent body.</strong> Differing views on whether changes to provide independent essentiality checking would improve negotiations</li>
  <li>
<strong>who should carry essentiality checks.</strong> Many respondents thought that independence was important but there were differing views on who should carry out the checks including such as SDOs or public bodies</li>
  <li>
<strong>limitations on independent third-party essentiality checks.</strong> Respondent commented on the scope of essentiality checks and the limitations. Differing views on whether the check would be feasible</li>
  <li>
<strong>legal certainty on essentiality checks.</strong> Many responses said legal certainty could only be provided by the courts</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>The introduction of essentiality checks by an independent party is not necessary</h3>

<p>3.23.
Two respondents said that an independent third-party would not be the most suitable person to carry out essentiality checks. Rather, the most appropriate person would be the parties to a negotiation who are most familiar with the patents. Some respondents referred to the Hantei service offered by the Japanese Patent Office and noted that this has rarely been used. A respondent argued that parties in negotiations should be entitled to use checks which they feel will be helpful in negotiations. The respondent noted that currently parties use various third-party published studies and commission assessments, specifically themselves.</p>

<p>3.24.
One respondent said that there is already a vast amount of information about <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> essentiality available to the public through commercial <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> mapping and landscaping services. The response questioned whether there is a real need for more transparency and said that it is not clear who would benefit from an essentiality check. Another respondent said that closer scrutiny of patent validity should be prioritised as a first step, rather than the introduction of an essentiality check service. The respondent added that they strongly opposed legislators and regulatory bodies introducing a system of resolving disputes around <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> by solely weakening the negotiating position of technology adopters.</p>

<p>3.25.
Several respondents stated that third-party essentiality assessments can be helpful if carefully structured to be truly independent and avoid bias. However, recommended that current industry-driven efforts should be allowed to play out, so that the benefits, challenges, and potential of essentiality assessments can be learned before the UK government decides on a major course of action.</p>

<p>3.26. Many respondents stated that patent licensing platforms already provide a solution and includes methods to adequately distribute royalties among the participating licensors. This is discussed further under the section on patent pools for essentiality checks below . A respondent said that the UK already has two essentiality services (the UK courts and the IPO’s Opinion Service).</p>

<h3>Limitations and disadvantages of independent third-party essentiality checks</h3>

<p>3.27.
Some responses drew attention to the limitations or disadvantages of essentiality checks in general. Some said an essentiality check service would only be an indication of essentiality, since the final determination must be made by a court with the powers to do such a determination. Another said that a disadvantage of essentiality checks is that they are not legally binding unless confirmed by courts. One respondent stated that an essentiality review concept presents significant practical and fairness issues.<a class="govuk-link" href="#_msocom_3">[JA3]</a></p>

<p>3.28.
Several responses gave their views on the costs that would be associated with checks. One said an independent service reviewing every patent would be a waste of resources. A further three respondents stated that an independent service would be slow and expensive. Another said that if costs were borne by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder this could disincentivise participation by small firms in the standardisation process or result in reduced research. However if borne by the licensees (directly or indirectly in the form of higher royalties) this could be more costly than simply accepting the licence with less information. Another respondent noted they were unclear on the cost of such service and the benefit it would bring.</p>

<p>3.29.
Some respondents had more specific concerns about the idea of independent third-party checks. One respondent said that an independent review of the essentiality of patents by itself is not enough to address concerns as the results of the check can be as readily ignored by an implementer as a self-certification from the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owner. Another respondent stated that the third-party essentiality checks could be used by potential licensees to demand a patent-by-patent review and a refusal to accept a portfolio license. One respondent stated that an independent service would not improve licensing if ‘independence’ is taken as the sole eligibility criterion for third party essentiality checks. One respondent said an independent verification could be helpful, however, it could also create issues if the results were wrong.</p>

<h3>Potential benefits of introducing independent third-party essentiality checks</h3>

<p>3.30. On the other hand, many respondents stated that a properly resourced independent body should carry out essentiality checks. The IPO or certified law firms were given as examples.  Many said there should be a neutral third-party independent body.</p>

<p>3.31. One respondent stated that the introduction of an essentiality check service could, under certain circumstances, improve licensing negotiations. However, this will be subject to certain factors e.g., the technical feasibility, institutional feasibility procedural aspects and policy considerations. A respondent said an independent service would be most effective in improving transparency for standards where there is little or no information that exists. In this respect, an independent service would be more helpful for smaller companies.</p>

<h3>Who should carry out essentiality checks?</h3>

<p>3.32.
Several respondents commented on the qualities of those who should carry out checks. Three respondents stated that the essentiality checks should be undertaken by qualified assessors. Other respondents said that it was important for reviewers to be independent, neutral or knowledgeable, and free from bias introduced by the funding of the process. Another respondent recommended that such checks should be ex-parte without involvement of parties.</p>

<p>3.33.
One respondent said that patent offices are not in a position to conduct such checks despite the fact patent offices are trained and competent in conducting validity checks. The respondent noted that these are different to essentiality checks.</p>

<p>3.34.
However, several respondents saw a role for governments or patent offices. One respondent pointed to the conclusion reached in the JRC (Joint Research Centre) study Pilot Study for Essentiality Assessment of Standard Essential Patents<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup> that the European Patent Office (EPO) should consider playing an active role in carrying out essentiality assessments. One respondent said the IPO should amend the Manual of Patent Practice to include sections on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. In addition, the Department for Business should coordinate the annual publication of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> rulings and policies. A respondent stated that UK legislation should set out the nature of an essentiality check and set specific requirements for the checks to meet. This should then be followed by regulators carrying out regular audits and ongoing reviews of policy to ensure that their criteria meets the legal standard set. One respondent stated that the British Standards Institute (BSI) should set up a database of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> in the UK.</p>

<p>3.35.
One respondent stated that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could be involved in essentiality checking. For example, the SDO could engage an independent group of expert engineers to check essentiality before a patent family can enter the pool.</p>

<h3>Patent pools for essentiality checks</h3>

<p>3.36.
Several respondents, including some licensing administrators, pointed out that patent pools conduct an essentiality determination. One respondent pointed to the way essentiality checks are carried out by patent pools as a good example. The respondent added that the same criteria is used for evaluation of all the patents and the process allows the licensor to submit comments, substitute patents from the same family and conduct technical discussions with the evaluator.</p>

<p>3.37.
Another respondent said that most patent pools hire third party assessors for essentiality and these assessors carry out a fair evaluation to a reasonable degree. They were doubtful whether any governmental body work would yield better evaluation to secure further credibility. Other responses noted that the assessors carrying out essentiality checks are patent lawyers who are expert in both the technology and the patent laws of the issuing jurisdiction and are independent. A respondent noted that patent pools are required to mandatorily undertake such checks to invoke the safe harbour provisions and claim exemption from Article 101 of the <abbr title="Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union">TFEU</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.38.
However, a respondent stated that patent pool determinations are often confidential and not publicly available. This creates opacity as there is no disclosure on how a conclusion was reached for validity. Another respondent added that not all licensees respect the patent pools results on the checks.</p>

<h3>Requirements for essentiality checks and other obligations</h3>

<p>3.39.
Three respondents said that any essentiality check system should be voluntary. Another respondent added that an essentiality check is only as good as the time resource allowed and the person making it. To that effect, any statutory scheme would need to meet high standards and would need to include scope for an appeal. It would also need to be voluntary to ensure that the basic legal principles are not breached. Two respondents said that any essential service cannot be a substitute for judicial proceedings or that the option for judicial determination must be open.</p>

<h3>Legal certainty for essentiality checks</h3>

<p>3.40. One respondent stated that the existing level of legal certainty provided by essentiality checks depends on the value of the standard. Higher value standards are given a higher degree of certainty by the organisation through studying the standard. However, lower value standards are deemed by commercial providers not to be economically worthwhile to study, thus making it unlikely to be economically worthwhile to provide a high degree of certainty.</p>

<p>3.41. However, many respondents argued that a legally binding decision on essentiality or non-essentiality can only be made by courts. Some respondents also argued that improved essentiality checks which do not have the binding characteristics of court decisions will not improve licensing negotiations or provide legal certainty.  A respondent added essentiality checks should not carry with it any legal certainty in case the parties later resort to litigation. One respondent stated that an essentiality assessment should not relieve a patent holder from its obligation to prove that an alleged <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> is essential and infringed under traditional patent law principles and burdens of proof. Another respondent said that the burden of proof should be put on the party that disagrees with the assessment during litigation proceedings of patent infringement.</p>

<p>3.42.
One respondent stated that it is impractical to determine essentiality with legal certainty for more than a very small proportion of patents and it is impossible to make reasonably accurate assessments for all declared-essential patents. Another respondent stated that the determination of a higher legal certainty would require each and every patent in a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolio to be successfully asserted which would be unrealistic, unproductive and impractical.</p>

<p>3.43.
One respondent proposed that legal certainty could be improved. They said that a layer of legal uncertainty can be removed through legal review of the essentiality by judges who are active with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> litigation.</p>

<h3>Transparency of essentiality checks</h3>

<p>3.44.
Some responses discussed publication of  the outcome of essentiality checks. A respondent said that the most effective third-party essentiality assessment system would be a simple “decision-only” in which the assessor publishes a simple conclusion whether the patent is found essential. On the other hand, two respondents said that essentiality claim charts should be made public, with claim construction analysis set out by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder. Several respondents said that essentiality checks should be made publicly available. A respondent said that this would enable third parties to have visibility on the quality and matter of the assessment. Another respondent added that for better transparency, it is crucial for any resulting essentiality determinations to be publicly available.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>3.45.
Several responses proposed approaches for dealing with large volumes of potentially essential patents. Some respondents said that sampling should be considered for larger portfolios and rely on sound, transparent and statistical principles. One respondent recommended that if a limited essentiality review is conducted, the selection of patents should occur on a random basis, to avoid a patent holder selecting the ‘best’ patent and seeking to extrapolate the results of that verification to the wider patent portfolio. Two respondents said that the scope of essentiality checks should be clear, e.g., any findings of essentiality with respect to one patent should not imply that this applies to the broader portfolio. One respondent said that any obligation on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners to follow a certain process should be mirrored by licensees, i.e., to take a licence on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms.</p>

<p>3.46.
 Some respondents commented on the stage at which the checks should be carried out. One respondent commented that SDO policies could put in place early disclosure of alleged essential patents to overcome some of the issues and provide greater certainty for technology adopters. Another respondent stated that there can be mandatory checking of essentiality checks upon certain trigger events such as finalisation and update of the relevant standard.</p>

<h3>Cost burden</h3>

<p>3.47.
Some respondents discussed who should bear the costs of essentiality checks or suggested how they could be minimised. One respondent said that essentiality checks should not add to the burden of <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> that do not have the resources to spot or challenge poor checks. Another respondent said that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder should pay for the essentiality check and those costs should not be too onerous. The respondent pointed out that at present, litigation is the only way to challenge essentiality of self-declared <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> which is expensive. Another respondent stated that essentiality checks could be carried out through a certain percentage of sampling which the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder pays for. Two respondents said that any third-party independent institutions should remain non-profit.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 11.</strong></p>

<p>As SEP portfolios are negotiated with individual implementers, in your view is there sufficient transparency around pricing available when entering into negotiation? Is there a justification under FRAND for different SEP implementers, using the SEP for the same purpose, to be charged different rates for market access?</p>

<p><strong>Question 12.</strong></p>

<p>Would some form of pricing transparency be appropriate for supporting implementers in FRAND pricing negotiations?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Responses discussed views on the transparency of pricing, proposals for improvements and different rates for similarly situated SEPs. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>transparency of pricing:</strong> SEP holders tended to think that there was sufficient transparency of pricing in the main, while implementers did not. Responses discussed the use of NDAs</li>
  <li>
<strong>proposals to improve pricing transparency:</strong> Proposals included provision of resources for licensee, publication of rates or agreements, and guidance</li>
  <li>
<strong>different rate for similarly situated SEPs:</strong> Many responses discussed the Unwired Planet case, either to show different rates were justified, or to criticise the decision</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Transparency of pricing</h3>

<p>3.48.
Several <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and others said that there is generally sufficient transparency of pricing with respect to the most widely adopted standardised technologies. One respondent stated that transparency around pricing depends on the maturity of a standard and that over time, royalty rates become known publicly  . One respondent suggested that licensing of cellular standards was a good example of transparency.  Another respondent argued that pricing transparency at an early stage is impossible as the market does not attach a value to the technology. Several respondents said that patent pools provided price transparency because they have transparent pricing and terms which are published on their websites.</p>

<p>3.49.
One respondent stated that the use of <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr> or confidentiality clauses are appropriate as parties discuss commercially sensitive information. The respondent also added that licensees can request unreasonable amounts of confidential information to delay negotiations. Some respondents said that licensees, as much as <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, want or insist on commercially provisions for commerciality sensitive information. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder said that to overcome some of the transparency issues, the respondent added that they have provided to prospective licensees anonymised information about prior licence agreements.</p>

<p>3.50.
However, many respondents said there was a lack of transparency due to the use of <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr> or confidentiality clauses. Some respondents  said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders require potential licensees to enter into restrictive <abbr title="Non-Disclosure Agreements">NDAs</abbr> or other agreements to access  basic information necessary to facilitate <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing. Some respondents argued that the confidentiality clause of the licensing agreement creates scepticism on the part of the licensee on whether the rate offered is the best offer. Another respondent suggested that there is no reason why <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing contracts should be kept confidential. One respondent argued that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should not be able to resist disclosure of rates to maximise revenue as this would go against the “non-discriminatory” element of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.51.
One respondent added that transparency over <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms was particularly important for royalty bearing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> to allow the market to assess whether to adopt the standard   Another respondent argued that issues of transparency are particularly acute for potential licensees new to telecoms. They said that many licensees have no experience with telecoms and often come with the assumption that off-the-shelf modules are paid up products with all the necessary licences in place.</p>

<h3>Proposals to improve transparency of pricing and other terms</h3>

<p>3.52.
Some responses suggested resources that could be made available for licensees who have less experience. One respondent suggested the IPO and other organisations could help educate implementers on how to approach information on pricing transparency. This respondent also suggested <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders could be encouraged to provide information on their licensing programmes, where they deem it appropriate and helpful to do so. Another respondent said high quality, neutral and reliable information would provide value to <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> and new IoT entrants on standardisation and licensing procedures. The respondent suggested these resources could be provided by the IPO or UK policymakers to improve transparency in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>3.53.
One respondent stated that there could be more transparency concerning both licence rates and who is licensed, as long as confidentiality of commercially sensitive information is properly observed. Another respondent stated that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should disclose non-confidential information such as a listing of the patents proposed to be licensed and details of the basis and methodology upon which the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> offer (including any royalty rate) has been calculated.</p>

<p>3.54. 
A number of respondents  proposed there should be greater availability of comparable licences. This would enable a potential licensee to check whether the rate in the comparable licence accurately reflects the effective royalty rate and the value of the patented invention . One respondent said licensors should not be prevented from disclosing licence terms and royalty rates that allow the evaluation of comparable licences, and that licences can be redacted to remove any particularly sensitive confidential information.</p>

<p>3.55. 
Several respondents argued licensing rates or agreements should be made public to improve pricing transparency. One respondent stated that pricing should be made public at the time of the adoption of the standard. Another respondent stated that offers should be publicly made available as early as possible.   Another respondent commented that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners should disclose their rates like patent pools, and global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> case judgments should be made public including royalty rates. One respondent said incentives should be introduced for sharing pricing information about existing licences so that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and courts can take non-discrimination seriously.</p>

<p>3.56. 
Some responses proposed there should be guidelines on pricing.       One respondent said they would welcome guidance on pricing transparency that is in line with competition rules which could be included in the Horizontal Guidelines<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup>. Another respondent stated that transparency of pricing guidelines would be beneficial.</p>

<p>3.57. 
One respondent said that licensing rates could be disclosed to a suitable body such as the relevant SDO, the IPO, a competition law authority, or a body like the copyrights tribunal. This respondent suggested the body could then publish information about licensing rates or be involved in setting licensing rates. Another respondent suggested that for dispute resolution mechanisms, there should be an early stage where the tribunal orders the parties to disclose to the tribunal and the other party’s legal representatives the contents of comparable licence agreements.</p>

<p>3.58.
 One respondent said that improving the transparency over the number of truly essential <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> can improve the efficiency of price negotiations between the two parties.</p>

<h3>Different rates for similarly situated <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>3.59.
Some respondents argued that <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments do not imply that all licensees will pay the same royalty but rather, should reflect the value that the patented standardised technology creates for the end-user product which may vary for different licensees. Another respondent suggested that rates vary due to various circumstances which include looking at the licensee’s sales profile, position in the market and product plans. Others said that rates could differ due to other factors such as cross-licensing agreements   and that royalties could be paid as lump sums.</p>

<p>3.60. 
Two respondents argued that the Supreme Court in Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup> held that the non-discrimination in the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> context does not mean that every licensee is entitled to the same rate, even similarly situated competitors. One respondent said that there were both potential competition law and contract law justifications for different implementers using the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> for the same purposes to be charged different rates for market access.</p>

<p>3.61.
Some responses stated that differences in pricing is not an issue as long as it is justified. A respondent said that it is assumed <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should be able to justify offering different licensing terms to licensees who use the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> for the same purpose as long as they have a genuine commercial reason. Another respondent stated that there may be justifications as to why different implementers may be charged different rates despite the fact that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> is being used for the same purpose. The respondent argued that these justifications need to be based on objective grounds and stated the broader concern around discrimination is that potential licensees that are similarly situated get charged different rates.</p>

<p>3.62. 
On the other hand, some respondents argued that there is no justification under <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> principles for different pricing. One respondent stated the purpose of the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment, and for the creation of the standard, is to ensure that the standard is available to all companies at the same price, in order to enhance and grow the market. This respondent said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences should not be based on the price of the end product as all companies were using the same standardised technology covered by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>. And they argued that that there was in fact discrimination between small and large companies.</p>

<p>3.63. 
One respondent argued that offering different rates to different competitors for access to the same market is discriminatory and in breach of competition law. Another respondent referred to Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> and argued that the case permits a type of discrimination in the UK, i.e., charging similar rates only to comparable undertakings, which otherwise would be considered a distortion of competition. Another  respondent argued that information asymmetry is exploited by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to their advantage as they possess information which the potential licensee does not have.</p>

<p>3.64.
On the other hand, some responses stated that offering different rates under <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> is not justified and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders have an unfair advantage in pricing negotiations. Some respondents argued that there is no justification under <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> principles for different pricing. Furthermore, one respondent argued that information asymmetry is exploited by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to their advantage as they possess information which the potential licensee does not have.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Patent infringement and remedies</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 13.</strong></p>

<p>Views are sought from respondents on the role that the patent system plays in the development of SEPs and FRAND licensing and whether there are issues within current practice (including law and court judgments) that create issues for innovators. Please include case studies or worked examples, if possible.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Respondents reported a variety of issues that affect parties that interact with the SEP ecosystem. Most of the responses highlighted issues for SEP holders or implementers. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>the benefits of the patent system in incentivising innovation.</strong> Respondents said the patent system incentivises contribution to a standard and promotes competition</li>
  <li>
<strong>issues for innovators in current SEP licensing practice.</strong> A number of issues were highlighted. While some said the UK system works well, some also said there were high levels of litigation around SEPs</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>The benefits of the patent system in incentivising innovation</h3>

<p>4.1. 
Respondents were asked about the role of the patent system in the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> landscape. Most <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and some others said the patent system is important to the development of standards as it incentivises contribution to a standard by providing a financial reward if the technology is adopted into the standard, this also promotes competition between different parties. Some of these respondents commented that without the patent system participation in standardisation would be limited. Some respondents also commented that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> allow smaller innovators to compete and have their technology solutions judged on merit alongside large companies.</p>

<p>4.2.
Two <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders commented that the current UK patent system and approach to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing generally works well and should continue to be followed. Some respondents said the current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> framework generally balances the interests of the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers. Some respondents commented that the quality of patents is important in providing confidence in the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> being licensed. One respondent stated a harmonised patent system is required for effective global enforcement of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. Another respondent suggested the patent system could play a greater role in the development of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> by requiring patent holders to disclose all discussions within the standardisation process that may be relevant to the validity and essentiality of the patent.</p>

<h3>Issues for innovators created by current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing practice</h3>

<p>4.3. 
There were a number of responses that reported problems within current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing practice. Some respondents said the telecommunications sector appeared to attract a high level of litigation or was not balanced. Various respondents, including <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, implementers, legal services, trade associations and consultancy services, stated that issues associated with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing lead to litigation that is costly and time consuming. Some responded that negotiated outcomes should be incentivised. However, one respondent commented that the fact that there are some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes is not surprising given the large number of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and the value of the technology involved.</p>

<p>4.4. Several respondents, mostly <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, said <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders can experience problems due to hold-out<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup> by implementers. Some said this is due to the lack of a meaningful disincentive for implementers that do not take licences. For further discussion of hold-out see section 2 on competition and market functioning. Some respondents said hold-out can lead to cash flow problems for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders by extending the time between R&amp;D and a licence being agreed. Some respondents stated that the need for litigation creates problems for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders with large patent portfolios. One respondent also said licensing whole portfolios patent by patent is unrealistic but demanded by some implementers. Some respondents were also concerned about the possibility of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders being told what level of the value chain to license at, and about potential requirements for greater transparency increasing costs and delays to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Some respondents also suggested the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> framework would be undermined by mandating certain methods of royalty rate determination or licensing at the component level.</p>

<p>4.5.
A number of respondents discussed issues that create problems for implementers or potential licensees. Many respondents, mostly implementers, raised concerns about the current practice of granting of injunctions in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> cases. Some commented that this creates uncertainty or financial risk for implementers. One responded that just over one in three UK businesses they surveyed indicated that the risk of injunctions decreases their incentive to develop new products. One respondent also expressed concern about forum shopping by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders during disputes undermining aims to encourage innovation. Another respondent suggested there should be greater harmonisation of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rules and the approaches of different courts adjudicating on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes.</p>

<p>4.6.
Some respondents stated that issues were caused by a lack of transparency in licensing negotiations or <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> declaration. Some responses stated that this lack of transparency slows negotiations and hampers efforts to plan for costs. A respondent also reported that it is difficult to verify the essentiality of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, particularly for whole portfolios.</p>

<p>4.7.
A number of respondents said that hold-up<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup> by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders is an issue. For further discussion of hold-up see section 2 on competition and market functioning. One respondent stated that companies are compelled to litigate to get a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate as <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders demand excessive rates. Some respondents stated that UK court judgements create problems for implementers or potential licensees due to the possibility of global licence fees being set. These respondents stated this creates uncertainty, increases the cost of recovering unduly paid licence fees, affects the ability of small businesses to compete in foreign markets, makes negotiations unbalanced, or increases complexity of licensing. One of these respondents also stated that having to agree to a global licence before knowing the licence terms, as in Optis v Apple<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup>, prevents small businesses making informed decisions.</p>

<p>4.8.
Some respondents stated that there are issues for new market entrants or small companies as they may lack the resources or expertise to avoid or refute infringement claims, or to get a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate. One of these respondents pointed to companies in the IoT sector being unaware that purchased components may expose them to infringement claims. A few respondents also stated licences should be available to any third party that wants one. One respondent stated that <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> are at a disadvantage due to the lack of transparency in the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> ecosystem. This respondent also stated that <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> are at a disadvantage due to their inability to verify whether licensing rates and terms are <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>, and whether representations made to them by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders are true.</p>

<p>4.9.
Some respondents also commented on whether <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> should be considered different to other patents, legal remedies available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes; and case law relevant to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. Comments relating to the legal framework in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes and whether <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> should be treated differently to other patents have been covered in this section below question 16. Further discussion of legal remedies available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes is also provided below question 16. Some responses also commented on global licensing decisions by UK courts. These comments are discussed in section 6 on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 14.</strong></p>

<p>As patents are territorial in nature, does the current patent regime create a fair global market? Do SEP licensing costs vary by region?</p>

<p><strong>Question 15.</strong></p>

<p>Are legal actions and injunctive actions taken equally against infringers of SEPs, regardless of their territorial presence?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Respondents generally reported that there is variation in SEP licensing rates, SEP licensing costs and whether litigation is pursued. There were differing views as to whether the global SEPs market is fair and the perception of the UK within the global market. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>regional variation in SEP licensing costs</strong>. Respondents reported that SEP licensing costs generally vary by region due to a variety of factors. Some said global SEP licences are common and can account for regional variations in licence rates</li>
  <li>
<strong>fairness in the global market</strong>. There were differing views as to whether the global SEPs market is fair and consistent between regions. Various factors were reported to cause an unfair global market</li>
  <li>
<strong>factors affecting where litigation is pursued</strong>. The jurisdiction(s) in which SEP litigation is pursued depends on a variety of factors, including costs, relevance of the market, and judgements relevant to likelihood of favourable outcomes</li>
  <li>
<strong>perceptions of the UK courts as a forum for SEP litigation</strong>. Some said UK courts are perceived to be favoured by or friendly to SEP holders</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Regional variation in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing costs</h3>

<p>4.10.
Respondents were asked whether <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing costs vary by region. The majority of respondents that responded to question 14 said that licensing rates vary by region for a variety of factors, including market differences, such as production, manufacturing and sales costs, and product profits. Other factors respondents stated may cause regional variation in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing rates are differences in economic development level, differences in regional patent protection, differences in the approach of the national judiciary, and differences in litigation outcomes. Some respondents commented that such variation is appropriate. One respondent stated that precautions are required that prevent national or regional differences in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing practice from distorting competition, for example due to differing licence terms or rates.</p>

<p>4.11.
Some respondents commented more broadly on costs of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing. Some respondents stated that the costs of licensing vary by region, for example due to differences in the pace of negotiations or due to enforcement costs. One of these respondents, however, stated that for bilateral negotiations the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing cost should be consistent irrespective of country if enforcement costs are not considered.</p>

<h3>Global licences and regional licence rates</h3>

<p>4.12.
A number of respondents, mostly <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, stated that global <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences are common for large patent portfolios or in certain technology areas. Some of these respondents said that the cost and practicality of maintaining patent portfolios precludes patents being sought or enforced in every country. Some respondents commented that global licences can account for varying regional licensing rates. One respondent however, stated that the accounting for regional variation in global licence negotiations may not occur in practice. Some respondents also stated that regional rates have been used in <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences determined set by courts, with some respondents specifically pointing to the Unwired Planet decision<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote">[footnote 56]</a></sup>. One respondent went on to state that, because negotiations are required to be <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>-compliant, royalty rates cannot be fixed arbitrarily and global licences should consider regional differences.</p>

<p>4.13.
One respondent stated that most patent pools use a single global royalty rate, with one patent pool administrator also commenting that their patent pool uses a single global rate. However, one patent pool administrator stated that its patent pools use two different rates for different regions.</p>

<h3>Fairness in the global market</h3>

<p>4.14.
Respondents were asked about whether the current patent regime creates a fair global market. One respondent stated that there is a fair global market as the patent system is equally available to all market participants. Many respondents referred to global licensing agreements when considering the fairness of the patent regime. One respondent stated that global licences are efficient and standard practice. Another respondent stated that UK courts have been fair and pragmatic in their decisions. One respondent said the enforcement regime in the UK is balanced. One respondent stated that the territorial nature of the patent regime does not mean there cannot be a fair global market, provided there is the ability for a patent owner to obtain a global settlement.</p>

<p>4.15.
Several respondents suggested the current patent regime does not create a fair global market. A number of reasons were provided for this. These included variations between jurisdictions in the awarding of injunctions, variations in the amount of damages awarded in different jurisdictions, unfairness due to regulators and courts that see their role as the protection of local industry, and foreign courts extending their jurisdiction unreasonably beyond their own territories. Other reasons provided were the costs and difficulty of enforcing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, deliberate infringement implementers unlicensed users of standardised technology to avoid costs, the selective enforcement of patents by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders based on geographical location of products and/or providers, <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> being charged higher rates than larger or foreign companies, <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders refusing to grant licences at the component level rather than the end device level, and difficulties in trying to establish validity and essentiality of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.16.
Several respondents also suggested court adjudicated global licensing does not create a fair global market. Several respondents stated that ‘forced’ global licensing by national courts has a number of negative consequences. See section 6 on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation for further discussion of the drawbacks of national courts determining global licences. One respondent stated that global licensing rates are seen as the price of doing business in the UK.</p>

<p>4.17.
One respondent stated that it is a competitive disadvantage to have headquarters, logistics centres or manufacturing sites in the UK or Germany due to the risk of injunctions. This respondent said the current patent system incentivises having as much of what is necessary to provide a good or service located outside the UK or a major EU market. This respondent pointed to Apple having to temporarily close down stores and online as a result of litigation, stating this negatively impacts consumers and national economies.</p>

<p>4.18.
A few respondents suggested international cooperation was needed for alignment of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> policies and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing in different regions. One of these respondents said this would benefit all parties involved as it would increase legal certainty and reduce transaction costs in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing.</p>

<h3>Factors affecting where litigation is pursued</h3>

<p>4.19.
The call for views asked whether legal action against infringers is taken regardless of the territorial presence of the infringer. Some respondents stated that legal actions are taken against infringers regardless of their territorial presence. However, some said that it is not feasible for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners to bring infringement proceedings in every jurisdiction where a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> is infringed due to the cost and expertise required. Some respondents stated that actions are not taken equally against infringers, with some of these respondents stating that <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> are seen as an ‘easy target’ in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> disputes due to their lack of resources. One of these respondents reported that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders force <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> to take licences at non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates and then use these as a basis to extract greater licence rates from future potential licensees.</p>

<p>4.20.
Many respondents stated that the jurisdiction litigation is pursued in depends on a variety of factors. Factors provided were whether the courts are perceived to be favourable to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or whether courts are perceived as biased towards local companies, the methods used to calculate <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates, the perceived willingness of the court to grant injunctions against implementers, whether a court is willing to decide a global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence, court efficiency and costs, whether there are specialist <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> courts and judges, the perceived quality of the patent system, the place of infringement, the relevance of the market, and the manufacturing and operating locations. A number of respondents stated that differences in the approaches of national courts leads to forum shopping. One respondent also said litigation is difficult in jurisdictions with weak <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> systems or jurisdictions that see their role as protecting local industry. The respondent commented that this allows infringers to not take a licence in these jurisdictions and makes it difficult for competitors outside the region to compete.</p>

<h3>Perceptions of the UK courts as a forum for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation</h3>

<p>4.21.
Several respondents also commented on the perception of the UK as a litigation forum. Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders said that the decisions of the UK judiciary are regarded as pragmatic or seminal in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes, despite there being issues with the UK legal framework. Some implementers and other respondents stated that the UK is preferred by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or perceived to be friendly to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Some of these respondents attributed this to the decisions in the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote">[footnote 57]</a></sup> and Optis<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote">[footnote 58]</a></sup>cases. Some respondents said that UK law is not aligned with the global consensus. Some respondents stated that the Unwired Planet decision incentivises <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to assert patents against willing licensees acting in good faith. Some respondents made reference to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders using ‘abusive’ tactics in the UK. One respondent stated that whilst the UK is perceived to be friendly to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder is usually based outside the UK and so the revenues from ‘abusive’ <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> enforcement leave the UK.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 16.</strong></p>

<p>Does the current framework work for you in enforcing your rights conferred by holding the patent? For example, are injunctions an effective tool? What is the impact of anti-suit injunctions by implementers?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>There were differing views on the legal remedies available in SEP disputes and whether those currently available are appropriate and/or effective. There were also a number of responses relating to the legal framework available for SEP enforcement and whether SEPs should be considered differently to other patents. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>enforcement of patent rights.</strong> There were a mixture of views as to how effective SEP enforcement currently is</li>
  <li>
<strong>treatment of SEPs distinct from other patents.</strong> There were a mixture of views as to whether SEPs should be treated differently to other patents when considering legal remedies available in disputes</li>
  <li>
<strong>expected behaviour of negotiating parties.</strong> Some respondents said UK and European case law provides a framework for FRAND-compliant negotiations. There were a mixture of views as to what behaviours should be considered ‘willing’ or ‘unwilling’ in negotiations</li>
  <li>
<strong>injunctions.</strong> There were a mixture of views as to whether injunctions should be used in SEP disputes and varied proposals on legal remedies that should be available in SEP disputes</li>
  <li>
<strong>anti-suit injunctions (ASIs).</strong> There were differing views as to the appropriateness and impact of ASIs. Respondents suggested varied proposals to discourage ASIs</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Enforcement of patent rights</h3>

<p>4.22.
Many respondents commented on the appropriateness and effectiveness of tools available to enforce <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. Some respondents said enforcement is expensive and is also slow or time consuming. One of these respondents stated that the length of the court process in the UK is ill-suited to the nature of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes as the scope of the licence being determined may change in disputes lasting years. This respondent suggested the process would be more effective if UK courts addressed financial aspects of disputes at an earlier stage so that parties could get an early view of what the court’s likely determination on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> would be.</p>

<p>4.23.
One respondent stated that the current framework promotes hold-out by implementers. Another respondent said that injunctions are an effective tool in patent enforcement but are very hard to obtain, making hold-out and deliberate to avoid costs a worthwhile strategy for implementers. One respondent commented that implementers that are not willing to agree licences distort market competition and delay the ability to recover research costs which may force out companies with limited resources. One respondent said patent pools are efficient and effective means for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to be renumerated for their innovation.</p>

<p>4.24.
Many respondents also commented on whether <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> should be considered different to other patents, the legal remedies available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes the legal framework relevant to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. These responses are dealt with in the subsequent paragraphs. Comments relating to the effects of global licensing decisions by national courts are discussed in section 6 on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation.</p>

<h3>Treatment of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> distinct from other patents</h3>

<p>4.25.
Some respondents commented on whether a distinction between <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and other patents is, or should be, made. Some respondents, mostly <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, stated that all legal remedies available under relevant patent law should be available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> cases, including injunctions. One of these respondents also said the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment is not a waiver of rights to injunctions and any such waiver to patents rights would need to be explicit. One respondent stated that UK courts have found that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders do not automatically violate competition law by seeking an injunction or making an offer above that ultimately determined to be <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.26.
Some respondents, however, said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are different to other patents due to the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment and due to the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> being indispensable to complying with a standard. Some of these responses stated that in committing to <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders voluntarily forgo certain rights to the patent, such as the right to exclude others from the standard, and that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> may warrant specific remedies in patent and competition law.</p>

<h3>Expected behaviour of negotiating parties</h3>

<p>4.27.
Many responses related to whether negotiating parties are considered ‘willing’ or ‘unwilling’ under the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment and discussed relevant case law. The Huawei v ZTE decision<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote">[footnote 59]</a></sup> by the <abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr> was pointed to by many respondents as providing a framework for <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>-compliant <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing negotiations and providing guidance on when injunctions may or may not be issued. Several respondents commented that further clarification on behaviour that is allowed or obligated in negotiations has been provided by the UK courts in the Unwired Planet case<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:60" rel="footnote">[footnote 60]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4.28.
A number of respondents commented that the framework provided by this case law was balanced, clear and/or effective. A further respondent expressed concern about apparent efforts to push for a ‘redefinition’ of willingness of an implementer that would protect an implementer from an injunction whilst they effectively engaged in hold-out.</p>

<p>4.29. 
Two respondents, however, reported it is not clear what a ‘willing licensee’ is. A further respondent said that no court has considered the meaning of ‘willingness’ in patent pool licensing. Some respondents made suggestions as to circumstances in which potential licensees should be considered ‘willing’. One respondent also suggested having <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> issues addressed before other matters in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes to encourage negotiations and to judge whether parties are acting in good faith.</p>

<h3>Availability of injunctions within <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes and hold-up</h3>

<p>4.30.
Many respondents discussed legal remedies available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes, particularly injunctions. Comments on injunctions broadly fell into two categories. Some respondents thought that the availability of injunctions is useful in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. Another group of respondents thought that injunctions were generally inappropriate in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes and should only be available in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>4.31.
Several respondents, mostly <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, stated that the availability of injunctions is essential in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. A number of respondents said injunctions are needed, or can be useful, to get an implementer to negotiate in good faith or take a licence. Many respondents stated that injunctions are the only meaningful way of preventing implementers from avoiding paying <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties, with some of these commenting that restricting the remedies available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes would exacerbate hold-out by implementers. Some respondents pointed to the Supreme Court decision in the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote">[footnote 61]</a></sup> case where an injunction, rather than damages, was awarded in asserting that injunctions are the only meaningful disincentive to hold-out. Several respondents stated that damages are not an adequate substitute for injunctions as damages are limited to the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing rate. One respondent also suggested that in the UK, due to the decision in the Optis v Apple<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote">[footnote 62]</a></sup> case, there is a possibility that injunctions no longer discourage hold-out if to avoid an injunction the implementer simply needs to say at a later point in litigation that they will take a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>4.32.
One respondent said that more limited access to injunctions would coerce <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders into offering sub-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms to avoid the prospect of litigation. They alleged this would disincentivise investment in standards development, particularly for research organisations and small businesses.</p>

<p>4.33.
Commenting on hold-up, some respondents also suggested the risk of opportunism by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders in seeking injunctions was overstated. These respondents stated that this risk had already been dealt with in the UK by the Unwired Planet decision which prevents the threat of an injunction to extract above <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates. Some respondents also pointed to the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:63" rel="footnote">[footnote 63]</a></sup> and Huawei v ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:64" rel="footnote">[footnote 64]</a></sup> decisions as showing that injunctions are not inappropriate against ‘unwilling’ licensees. One respondent said UK courts should continue to apply discretion in the granting of injunctions.</p>

<p>4.34.
On the other hand, other respondents, mostly implementers, broadly thought injunctions were inappropriate in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. Several respondents stated that monetary relief is an appropriate remedy and is better aligned with <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> principles. One respondent pointed to a European Commission judgement against Motorola<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote">[footnote 65]</a></sup>, stating the European Commission found damages to be an adequate remedy for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> infringement. Some respondents stated that injunctions do not appear to achieve the desired outcome of the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> agreement as neither the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder nor the implementer earn money. Several respondents stated that injunctions cause, or may cause, a disproportionate loss to the implementer compared to the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder. One academic commented that the injunction awarded in the Unwired Planet decision was disproportionate to the estimated value of the infringed patents. A few respondents stated that the risk of injunctions discourages businesses from adopting standardised technology. One respondent also raised concerns that injunctions could be misused to threaten the integrity of critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>4.35.
Some respondents said injunctions encourage or facilitate hold-up by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and the availability of injunctions creates an imbalance in licensing negotiations. These respondents stated the threat of injunctions puts pressure on potential licensees in negotiations and are, or can be, used to demand non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties. As evidence of this, one respondent pointed to decisions where the court determined <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate was far lower than the licence rate initially offered by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:66" rel="footnote">[footnote 66]</a></sup>. A respondent commented that the cost of non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates is ultimately passed onto the consumer. Some said that this behaviour is regularly seen from non-practicing entities and patent assertion entities.</p>

<p>4.36.
One respondent reported that it is current practice to grant injunctions without the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder having engaged in transparent negotiations and that this is problematic. Some respondents stated that the pressure of accepting a non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence under the threat of an injunction may be compounded by it taking longer to pursue invalidation procedures than to obtain an injunction.</p>

<p>4.37.
A number of respondents were concerned about UK case law where injunctions can be issued if an implementer does not agree to a global licence and reported that this increases the leverage <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> holders have in negotiations. One of these respondents commented that ‘forcing’ implementers to take global licences to avoid an injunction does not make sense to an SME operating in a local market. One respondent stated that the Unwired Planet decision allows <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to obtain injunctions against willing licensees.</p>

<h3>Proposals on the issuance of injunctions</h3>

<p>4.38.
Many respondents who thought injunctions were inappropriate in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes stated that injunctions should only be issued in rare circumstances. Suggested circumstances where injunctions may be appropriate are where the implementer is unable or refuses to pay damages, or where the defendant is not subject to a UK court that could award monetary compensation. One respondent pointed to the US case eBay v MercExchange<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:67" rel="footnote">[footnote 67]</a></sup> as an example of only awarding injunctions in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>4.39.
One respondent suggested that injunctions should not be sought until a court has determined what the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence rate would be.  Another respondent suggested that injunctions should only be available to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders that have acted in good faith at all times and when implementers have not acted in good faith. One respondent suggested that an implementer should be able to avoid an injunction by invoking a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> offer submitted to the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder by a supplier in its supply chain. This respondent also suggested that courts should be able to determine compensation payments instead of issuing injunctions. Another respondent said legislation should be changed to state that injunctions should not be sought unless an implementer has been shown to be demonstrably unwilling to enter into a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>4.40.
Some respondents suggested that enhanced damages could be awarded instead of injunctions. One respondent said that enhanced damages, in addition to injunctions, should be awarded as this would incentivise implementers to enter <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences at an early stage. They stated that an implementer facing the prospect of an injunction alone would be no worse off than if they had taken a licence earlier. Another respondent stated that there is currently no downside for licensees negotiating in bad faith as they ultimately only have to pay a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate.</p>

<p>4.41.
There were various proposals regarding what should be considered by the courts when deciding whether to grant an injunction. One implementer made a broad statement that UK courts should apply more restrictive criteria when granting injunctions. Some of the respondents that thought injunctions should only be granted in exceptional circumstances said the issuance of injunctions should be subject to a proportionality test. For example, it was suggested there should be consideration of public and national interest for technology relating to critical infrastructure. One respondent stated that the lack of a proportionality test for injunctive relief puts small businesses at a disadvantage to large companies seeking to enforce patents of ‘dubious’ quality. One academic commented that more analysis is needed into whether injunctions are proportional to the value of infringed patents under English law. One respondent, however, stated that proportionality assessments for granting injunctions would restrict a patent holder’s rights, would disincentivise sharing of innovation, and would essentially be compulsory licensing.</p>

<p>4.42.
Some respondents said that when deciding whether to issue an injunction the courts should consider the behaviour of both the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and the implementer, or the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment made by implementers. One respondent suggested that when considering injunctions relating to patent pools there should be a presumption that the licensing terms of the pool are <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> once there is broad acceptance of the pool in the market.</p>

<p>4.43.
Some respondents called for policy statements or a change to the Patents Act to say injunctions should only be available for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> in exceptional circumstances. One of these respondents said that if it were clear that injunctions for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> were only available in very rare circumstances there would be less incentive to forum shop. One respondent called for a policy statement that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders may not seek an injunction if the implementer acts in good faith. It was also suggested that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could include limitations on when a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder may seek an injunction or could require a commitment by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder to make a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> offer before seeking an injunction.</p>

<h3>Appropriateness of anti-suit injunctions</h3>

<p>4.44.
The call for views asked about the impact of anti-suit injunctions (ASIs). An ASI is an order made by a court preventing a party before it from commencing or continuing the same legal action in another or foreign jurisdiction or from enforcing a judgment obtained in foreign legal proceedings. Several respondents stated that the issuance of ASIs appear to be increasing in frequency. Though question 16 of the call for views refers to ASIs sought by implementers, one respondent commented that ASIs can be initiated by either <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or implementers. One respondent stated that ASIs in themselves are neither good nor bad, the appropriateness of an ASI is dependent on the facts of the case. One respondent said that ASIs may be the most appropriate compromise to resolving issues that affect multiple jurisdictions in the absence of a better alternative.</p>

<p>4.45.
Some respondents said that ASIs can be useful to implementers. A number of reasons were given for this. One respondent stated that ASIs can be useful where there is genuine overlap of the subject matter in dispute in different jurisdictions. Some respondents stated that ASIs avoid duplication of disputes in different jurisdictions and reduce costs associated with defending cases in multiple jurisdictions. One of these respondents also stated that ASIs reduce the risk of different jurisdictions coming to conflicting decisions. One respondent stated that an ASI may be sought by an implementer to prevent a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensor from pursuing litigation in other jurisdictions whilst a judge decides on the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms of a licence. Some implementers stated that the availability of ASIs to implementers is necessary to prevent <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders pursuing litigation in jurisdictions considered favourable to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and to ensure that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensors comply with their <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments. One respondent stated that an ASI may be sought by an implementer in anticipation of a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensor seeking litigation to coerce the implementer into a global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>4.46.
Some respondents said ASIs that have been issued by Chinese courts are problematic. One respondent stated that there have been cases where ASIs have been issued against a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder without the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder being notified of the court case, preventing the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder from being represented in the dispute. One respondent said that ASIs have been issued by Chinese courts without due process. Some respondents suggested that in some cases Chinese courts have issued ASIs to assert jurisdiction over the setting of global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates and to restrict the ability of foreign <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to obtain appropriate <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties. Several respondents pointed to the dispute launched by the European Commission against China at the World Trade Organization<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:68" rel="footnote">[footnote 68]</a></sup> (WTO) in asserting the problematic nature of some ASIs issued by Chinese courts.</p>

<h3>Causes and consequences of anti-suit injunctions</h3>

<p>4.47.
Several respondents said that the seeking of ASIs is encouraged by a lack of consensus in the approaches of different national courts to <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> issues. The respondents said this lack of consensus leads to forum shopping where parties look to start legal proceedings in a jurisdiction considered favourable to their interests. One respondent commented that ASI requests are made more likely by the setting of global licence terms by national courts. Another respondent pointed to the UK Supreme Court’s decision in Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:69" rel="footnote">[footnote 69]</a></sup> as a factor in the alleged rise in the use of ASIs. One respondent stated that ASIs are the result of a lack of international rules that prevent a party from proceeding with litigation in multiple jurisdictions concerning the same subject matter.</p>

<p>4.48.
A number of respondents said that the issuing of ASIs has negative consequences. Several respondents stated that ASIs are a problem for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and deprive <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders of the right to enforce their patents. Some respondents commented that ASIs are problematic due to the risk of fines and imprisonment when <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders seek access to justice in another country. A number of respondents stated that ASIs allow national courts to extend beyond their jurisdictions and undermine comity between national courts. Several respondents also reported that ASIs add to the cost, complexity and length of court litigation. A few respondents stated that ASIs increase legal uncertainty within dispute resolution. One respondent said ASIs incentivise parties to litigate in a jurisdiction deemed favourable to them rather than to focus on negotiated outcomes. One respondent suggested ASIs may result in regulatory capture where the courts of a country claim exclusive worldwide jurisdiction on a disputed matter.</p>

<p>4.49.
A number of respondents made statements relating to anti-anti-suit injunctions (<abbr title="Anti-anti-suit injunctions">AASIs</abbr>). <abbr title="Anti-anti-suit injunctions">AASIs</abbr> prevent parties from pursuing ASIs in other jurisdictions. One respondent stated that the ability to obtain <abbr title="Anti-anti-suit injunctions">AASIs</abbr> rendered ASIs an unproductive pursuit. One respondent said that <abbr title="Anti-anti-suit injunctions">AASIs</abbr> were of benefit as they preserve a party’s right to legal access in other jurisdictions. However, some respondents stated that <abbr title="Anti-anti-suit injunctions">AASIs</abbr> can have negative consequences such as further increasing litigation costs and depriving implementers of the ability to prevent <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders abusing their <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ownership.</p>

<h3>Proposals on the issuance of anti-suit injunctions</h3>

<p>4.50.
A number of respondents said ASIs should be discouraged and suggested ways of achieving this. One respondent suggested ASI requests could by discouraged by viewing such requests as a sign of an unwilling licensee or licensor under the framework set out by the <abbr title="Court of Justice of the European Union">CJEU</abbr> in the Huawei v ZTE decision<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:70" rel="footnote">[footnote 70]</a></sup>. One respondent said that the alleged issues associated with ASIs could not be solved at a national level. Some respondents said solving the alleged issues associated with ASIs would require convergence of jurisdictions on when injunctions should be available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. One respondent provided multiple suggestions for discouraging ASI requests. These were having a framework that encourages negotiated outcomes, providing a single forum for arbitrating disputes related to global licences, and granting anti-enforcement injunctions instead of ASIs. The respondent said anti-enforcement injunctions do not stop foreign litigation. One respondent said that improving transparency in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing may limit variation between different courts and reduce the incentive to forum shop. This respondent also suggested creation of a single tribunal to decide <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> disputes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>  Licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>
</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 17.</strong></p>

<p>In your view, how should the SEPs and FRAND licensing ecosystem adapt to new standard development for emerging technologies?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Some respondents said existing frameworks can adapt to new standard development for emerging technologies (such as IoT), while other respondents argued that there is a need for change. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>the existing framework could work well for new technologies.</strong> Some respondents said that there were already flexibilities and that licensing was an enabler of, rather than an barrier to new technology development. Building on existing good practice could help emerging technologies</li>
  <li>
<strong>the existing system needs to be improved.</strong> Some respondents said that recent court cases have shifted the balance of the system in favour of SEP holders, and that this need to be rectified to benefit emerging technologies. Respondents explained how they thought the system should improve</li>
  <li>
<strong>the challenges of uncertainty and complexity.</strong> Some respondents said that the complexity of SEP licensing and uncertainty about financial exposure when purchasing components were particular challenges for IOT start ups</li>
  <li>
<strong>proposals for changes in licensing practices.</strong> These included licensing higher up the value chain; more standardised licences and measures to improve transparency</li>
  <li>
<strong>the role of patent pools, SDO, and government or regulators.</strong> Several respondents said patent pools could help, or said that SDOs or government could take action, including in the case of government by changing the law around the use of injunctions and the determination of global FRAND licensing terms</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>The balance of the existing system can work well for emerging technologies</h3>

<p>5.1.
Some respondents stated that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing ecosystem generally functions well, particularly enabling market-specific practices, and the adoption of new markets, and that it provides for flexibility in licensing arrangements. One respondent argued that the benefits of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> and <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments are a good compromise between <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers in the adoption of new technologies. One respondent said that while <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing isn’t a one size fits all, <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing should not be considered as a barrier to the deployment of technology, but an enabler to the sharing of technologies.</p>

<p>5.2.
A respondent argued that any concerns around opportunistic practices arising in relation to emerging technologies can be overcome, as the UK courts are well adapted to address those practices.</p>

<h3>The balance of the existing system needs to be improved for emerging technologies</h3>

<p>5.3.
However, there were other respondents who argued that there is a need to improve the existing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing ecosystem to ensure it benefits the development of licensing in new sectors and to ensure the frameworks are fair and balanced. A respondent also argued that the ecosystem needs to adapt to assist implementers to strike favourable licensing deals to enable the counterbalance of what they described as the monopolistic position of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners.</p>

<p>5.4.
One respondent stated that their concerns related to the outcome of the UK court decision in Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:71" rel="footnote">[footnote 71]</a></sup>, and that as a result the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> ecosystem is now tilted towards <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, which effectively facilitates hold-up. The respondent further argued that UK <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> seeking to innovate in IoT will as a result be stifled by aggressive tactics used by foreign <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, impacting on the development of IoT.</p>

<p>5.5.
Another respondent stated that they saw an EU Exit opportunity for UK courts to reverse what they saw as a ‘pro-proprietor’ decision in Huawei v ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:72" rel="footnote">[footnote 72]</a></sup>. The respondent argued that UK courts could revert to the approach of directing parties to demonstrate the ‘willingness to negotiate’ in good faith, which would ensure technology implementers are able to innovate without unjustified threats.</p>

<h3>Building on existing good practice to support emerging technology</h3>

<p>5.6.
One respondent said that industry should apply what has worked well for current technologies, to ensure the ecosystem continues to adapt. Examples included blanket declarations of willingness to licence to allow the removal of penalties for late declaration and reduce incentive for “overdeclaration”; a register of declared patents with identifying paragraphs of the relevant parts of the standard; and the publication by SDO participants of targeted cumulative device royalty rates to give an indication to implementers to help them plan.</p>

<p>5.7.
Some respondents stated that the IoT already provides an example of a new approach to licensing. One respondent referred to the Nokia arrangement with Nordic Semiconductor, arguing that the arrangement allows companies purchasing IoT hardware from a component supplier to also have the opportunity to acquire cellular <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences.</p>

<h3>General adaptions to licensing approaches to support emerging technology</h3>

<p>5.8.
However, several respondents suggested that licensing approaches needed to adapt to encourage standard development for emerging technologies. Some said the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing system should strive to be more effective, better coordinated, and harmonised across jurisdictions to create a ‘one-stop-shop’ for implementers. Another respondent said that it should also provide a swift, simple, reliable, transparent, fair, cost-efficient mechanism to bring licensors and licensees together and offer incentives for good-faith behaviour. Other respondents argued that an efficient <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing ecosystem for emerging technologies should be configured so that licensing patterns for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> can be established, supply chains arranged according to market forces, and standard implementers are able to innovate on top of the standard technologies. One respondent said that the system should provide a low-threshold access for anyone who intends to add new functionalities (connectivity) to existing products, or who intends to introduce new products and services to get all necessary licences.</p>

<h3>The challenges of complexity and uncertainty for emerging technologies</h3>

<p>5.9.
Several respondents said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing is not widely known or understood, especially outside of the technology sectors. Some argued that the lack of awareness means that innovative UK businesses, large and small, will be ill-prepared to exploit the opportunities and overcome the challenges of the future, such as presented by the IoT revolution. A respondent also argued that given the increasing importance of interoperability and IoT, and more companies active in sectors other than ICT, new companies to the sector might find it more difficult to navigate this complex landscape than companies who are experienced. One respondent also said that although the value of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences should be considered on a case-by-case basis and based on the end value of the product, valuation of emerging technologies may be difficult for both <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers.</p>

<p>5.10.
One respondent stated that the IoT start-up community faced uncertainty around potential <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> liability and financial exposure when purchasing components from suppliers. The respondent further argued that failing to prevent the refusal of licences to upstream suppliers is likely to materially damage the efficient development and deployment of emerging technologies or hinder their broad adoption across different markets and products.</p>

<h3>Licencing higher up the value chain to support emerging technology</h3>

<p>5.11.
Some respondents argue that licensing higher up the value chain (including <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates) with a small number of existing chip or module manufacturers would provide greater predictability for the IoT start-up community, rather than having to have thousands of IoT companies having to individually negotiate licences.</p>

<p>5.12.
Another respondent stated that for the IoT, it should be possible to procure fully licensed connectivity modules, with licensing taking place at a module or component level to prevent the harmful impact to innovation by enforcing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> at a device level.  Respondents also argued that most modules and components that comply with a standard are use case agnostic.</p>

<p>5.13.
Other respondents, majority of whom were implementers or licensees, argued that <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences should be available to any third party irrespective of its position in the value chain. See summary of responses to Q.22 for further discussion of these issues.</p>

<h3>Standardised licencing agreements</h3>

<p>5.14.
A respondent stated that there needs to be more standardised licensing agreements to encourage the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing to adapt to emerging technologies, particularly where the use of standardised digital technology is an ancillary feature. A respondent also stated that licensing in emerging technologies can cause issues for innovators building on standardised technologies as they are not able to invest in new innovative products if cost of using that technology is unknown.</p>

<h3>The benefits of improved transparency for emerging technology</h3>

<p>5.15.
Some respondents said there was a need for greater transparency in licensing. Some wanted licensees to take steps to disclose licensing terms and royalty rates to ensure evaluation of comparable licences. One respondent argued that there needed to be a way for all potential entrants to an emerging market to easily understand which <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are essential, which are optional, and for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> claim charts to be available.</p>

<p>5.16.
One respondent argued that it is important to adapt the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing framework to the standard development for emerging technologies by eliminating over-declaration, introducing mechanisms to value <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolios, and solving <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> disputes expeditiously.</p>

<p>5.17.
Some respondents argued that essentiality checks should be standardised globally, with assessors being anonymous or random in their appointment. The respondents also stated that there should be a role for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to set out the essential technology to the modular level e.g. the sub-components of a radio access network (RAN), to ensure the facilitation of modular licensing for new entrants into the telecoms market.</p>

<h3>Impact on open source</h3>

<p>5.18.
One respondent discussed standard development in respect of open-source software. They argued that the MNO sector has been a dominant force in patents and standards through organisations such as ETSI. However, the respondent stated that their organisation is seeing a shift to Software Defined Networking and increasingly to the use of open-source software. The respondent also stated that this shift is creating conflicts between MNOs who wish to retain <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing patent royalties, while seeking to benefit from the use of open source.</p>

<h3>Adoption of patent pools for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing in new standard development</h3>

<p>5.19.
Some argued that patent pools are proven to foster the dissemination of standardised new technologies, or can offer access to standardised technologies for new implementers, such as <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. One respondent said that patent pools are uniquely placed to discover royalty rates for licences of new technologies, which helps balance the competing interests of licensors and licensees. Respondents also stated that the Avanci patent pool provides a successful licensing model that could be adopted for IoT licensing solutions. A respondent also argued that patent pool administrators could provide case studies of emerging technology licensing to help guide <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders in designing licences for different business models.</p>

<p>5.20.
One respondent stated that as soon as a final version of a new standard is available (or even before) forming of a patent pool should be considered. Another respondent argued that patent pools for emerging technologies should be encouraged where there is a genuine public interest in lowering the licensing cost. However, one response said that the forming, promoting and running of a patent pool should be done outside of a SDO to avoid interference.</p>

<h3>A role for Standard Development Organisations (<abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>) to support licensing of emerging tech</h3>

<p>5.21.
One respondent stated that difference in patent policies between <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> make for a healthy competitive environment among technologies, and that emerging technology developers have a choice of formulating standards and are able to contribute their technologies to a variety of existing <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> or forming a new SDO. Another respondent also stated that changing SDO policies could have a negative consequence on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders by mandating certain licensing terms/models and such changes are drawn from implementers ‘wish lists’. The respondent referred to the IEEE’s 2015 revisions to their IPR policy and the use of letters of assurance (LOA) required by innovators, arguing that this goes beyond <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> requirements and has resulted in fewer patent declarations and LOAs.</p>

<p>5.22.
However, some respondents commented that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could play a different role in light of new standard development for emerging technologies. One argued that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> have a responsibility to engage the wider stakeholder community, including academic, regulatory and government. Another respondent stated that the role of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> is to ensure <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing adapts to emerging technologies, raised questions around how <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> deemed to be central to emerging technologies are governed, and what can be done to increase participation at those <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> of companies which operate in the UK.</p>

<p>5.23.
Some respondents made the general point that there is a benefit for emerging technologies if there are balanced SDO IPR policies in place. Some respondents proposed <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> amend their existing <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> policies to accommodate <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing for emerging technologies. Proposals included changes to disclosure policies to help SDO participants evaluate whether technologies are being considered for standardisation are covered by patents. It was also argued that if <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> updated their patent policies this would help to provide guidance and clarity as to disclosure and other <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms. Some argued that in the telecoms sector, there has been greater clarity, reduced <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing-related abuses and reduced litigation as a result of the 2015 IEEE policy revisions.</p>

<p>5.24.
There were several other proposals put forward in relation to negotiation and dispute resolution. One respondent said that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could implement a defined process for implementers and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners to negotiate licences, so that implementers who do not follow this process lose the benefit of the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate. Some respondents also commented that any further SDO regulation should ensure there are dispute resolution procedures built in. One respondent said that would overcome the risk of injunctions or unwarranted tactics by licensees being brought by parties. Another respondent said <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> should to put in place binding arbitration as a means of resolving global disputes over <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties.</p>

<h3>Regulatory and government intervention</h3>

<p>5.25.
Some respondents argued that there was not a need for regulatory intervention to ensure <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing adapts to emerging technologies as existing laws, as there are existing measures available, including WTO agreements and national level laws, to provide sufficient obligations. One respondent argued that such intervention could fundamentally alter globally competitive standard development through non-market factors, and overregulating may remove flexibility in the current system.</p>

<p>5.26.
Some respondents were of the alternative view and argued for government intervention to ensure a clear framework is in place, particularly to help identify responsible <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> and to ensure greater levels of transparency around <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.27.
One respondent argued that challenges associated with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing can lead to a focus on legal expertise and detract from focus on quality and choice in the components available.    The respondent argued that the government should support technology adopters in enabling access to <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> prices, when licences for patents covering new technologies are being sought.</p>

<p>5.28.
One respondent stated that the current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation framework may threaten IoT opportunities in the UK, with UK <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> being vulnerable to holdup due to the lack of negotiating expertise, resources and global capacity to manufacture and market products abroad if subject to a domestic injunction. The respondent also argued that without intervention, the licensing at the end product level will be even more problematic as the different types of IoT devices increase, and manufacturers of IoT devices may avoid making investments in the UK until after global licences are agreed. The respondent proposed amendments to the Patents Act 1977, which included a provision which states that in the absence of consent of both parties, a court should not determine global portfolio rates for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences . Also, the respondent argues that there needs to be a provision stating that injunctions on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>-committed <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> should only be granted in exceptional circumstances where the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder cannot obtain through the courts the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties it voluntarily agreed to accept for use of its patents.</p>

<p>5.29.
The same respondent also argued that UK Government should create non-statutory guidelines (e.g. competition guidelines) to ensure fair, transparent and efficient access to licensing opportunities by endorsing valuation principles based on the smallest saleable patent practicing unit (SSPPU).</p>

<p>5.30.
Another respondent also stated that there is a role for competition authorities to take action where appropriate to address anticompetitive conduct by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. The respondent also stated that the UK Government should encourage <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> to adapt their policies to address abuses such as hold-up. Hold-up is dealt with in more detail within the market functioning section of this summary report.</p>

<p>5.31.
A respondent representing the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> legal services sector also argued that there needs to be widely accessible and balanced information concerning <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> and licensing, and this should be made available by a neutral platform e.g., the UK IPO, to educate businesses, particularly <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> which may well need to tackle licensing issues in the future.</p>

<p>5.32.
There were a number of general concerns that were raised in context of emerging technologies which are discussed in more depth in other sections. These include issues related to the threat of injunctions for implementers and the lack of regulatory “safe harbours”. Responses and evidence concerning the right to injunctive relief and <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> determinations are dealt with in section 6 on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> litigation below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 18.</strong></p>

<p>What if any, flexibilities exist within the IP framework that could improve the efficiency of obtaining a license for implementers?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Reponses to this question varied with differing views from SEP holder and licensees or implementers. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>sufficient flexibility in the current IP framework.</strong> Several responses said the IP framework already has sufficient flexibility to improve efficiency around obtaining a licence</li>
  <li>
<strong>market led approaches to improve efficiency.</strong> Some respondents said that market led approaches such as patent pools could help</li>
  <li>
<strong>changes to the current frameworks should be made to improve efficiency in SEP licensing.</strong>Responses included recommendations for guidance, regulation or legislative change, for example to make licences available higher up the value chain, restrict the use of injunctions or improve transparency</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Sufficient flexibility in the current <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> framework</h3>

<p>5.33
Some respondents argued that the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> frameworks are inherently flexible and argue that the current framework rightly leaves appropriate room for industry solutions. Some respondents also stated that the existing framework works without difficulty for implementers who are willing licensees. Respondents said that the judicial precedent in cases such as Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:73" rel="footnote">[footnote 73]</a></sup> and Huawei v ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:74" rel="footnote">[footnote 74]</a></sup> provide a balance for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>/<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing negotiations by imposing obligations of good faith conduct on both parties. One response said the decision in Huawei v. ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:75" rel="footnote">[footnote 75]</a></sup> has demonstrated that the current framework works appropriately. They said that the decision did not create a strict set of rules that parties must follow, nor provide justification for creating a one-size-fits-all approach. And any attempt to further define <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> requirements would inhibit different licensing models that suit specific purposes</p>

<p>5.34.
Additionally, several <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders argued that the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> framework does not require adjustments to improve the efficiency of licensing. One respondent stated that for standardised digital technologies, protected by many <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, agreement on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms depends far more on an assessment of the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owner’s overall contribution to the standard than on the provisions of <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> law. That assessment could be facilitated by  better understanding of the standard and of the technical significance of the various inventions contributed by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owner to the standard .</p>

<p>5.35.
Some argued that the ‘licence-to-all’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:76" rel="footnote">[footnote 76]</a></sup>approach is misplaced, and incorrect as a matter of law<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:77" rel="footnote">[footnote 77]</a></sup> and commercial practice<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:78" rel="footnote">[footnote 78]</a></sup>. Respondents stated that not all implementers along the supply chain need to have a licence and that some parties justify the approach to ‘licence-to-all’ by making reference to excerpts of some IPR Policies<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:79" rel="footnote">[footnote 79]</a></sup>, and do not interpret those specific excerpts in the overall context they are a part of. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder also stated that licensing generally occurs at a single point in the supply chain and is generally regarded as the most efficient approach to licensing. Another <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder said that in relation to telecoms, it is standard industry practice to licence at the OEM level<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:80" rel="footnote">[footnote 80]</a></sup> to enable greater efficiency, to minimise transaction costs and increase legal certainty. The respondent also references the ETSI IPR policy, which foresees “have-made”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:81" rel="footnote">[footnote 81]</a></sup> rights to ensure the entire value chain is able to benefit from a licence.</p>

<p>5.36.
One stated that they do not see difficulty within the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> frameworks but difficulties with efficiency in respect of licensing, due to implementers drawing out negotiations to avoid payment. In these circumstances, the respondent states that the only option currently is to go to court, which they argue is not efficient. The respondent also argued that matters would be more inefficient if courts were unable to deal with global licences.</p>

<p>5.37.
Another respondent said that expert determination and arbitration are available under the current framework, for parties to obtain the necessary licence for implementers, however, the cost and time of these flexibilities may be unlikely to constitute a significant improvement on litigation.</p>

<h3>Changes are needed to improve the efficiency of obtaining a licence for implementers</h3>

<p>5.38.
However many respondents argued that some change to the existing framework was needed.
These mainly included implementers, licensees, representative groups and legal services and academia, although there were some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders who also advocated changes. Many respondents referred to existing challenges for <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> in making the case for change and one respondent stated that the current patent system in the UK makes it a competitive disadvantage to be located in the UK</p>

<p>5.39.
The respondent also stated that changes need to incentivise good-faith behaviours and that bad-faith behaviours to be sanctioned, regardless of what party it related to.</p>

<h3>Market led approaches to improve efficiency</h3>

<p>5.40.
There were a number of responses that made suggestions and proposals for market led approaches to improve efficiency. In particular, respondents referred to patent pools as an option to provide greater flexibility to improve the efficiency of obtaining a licence for implementers. Although, a respondent raised a concern that although patent pools may be considered as a market approach, they are not created for more niche standards, and as they are run by private companies, the pools tend to be only established for niche ‘beneficial standards’.</p>

<p>5.41. 
Respondents also suggested a model of independent licensing agents being useful to arranging licences for implementers. A respondent provided a specific example of a model of an independent licensing agent that should be supported. The respondent referred to Rational Patent(‘RPX’)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:82" rel="footnote">[footnote 82]</a></sup>, explaining that RPX has shown itself to be a useful tool for arranging licences for implementers as it acts as an agent, and there is no unwanted collaboration or illegal collusion, neither amongst licensors nor amongst licensees.</p>

<h3>Changes to the framework to provide licenses higher in the value chain</h3>

<p>5.42.
Several respondents said there should be guidance, regulation or changes to legislation to promote the provision of licenses higher in the value chain. Some respondents related this to the doctrine of exhaustion. They argued that reinforcing or better respecting the doctrine of exhaustion would make licensing more efficient. A respondent also stated that the doctrine of exhaustion has worked well in other sectors such as the automotive sector, where traditionally suppliers ensure that all third-party rights are exhausted before components are sold onwards in the supply chain. Respondents also stated that without exhaustive licences at the component level, <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> and incubation businesses are exposed to patent litigation and/or uncertain licensing costs. Therefore, they said government should consider guidance or amendment to the Patents Act to ensure that any company willing to take a licence on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms is able to get one.</p>

<p>5.43.
Other respondents said legislation such as the Patents Act 1997 should ensure <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licenses are available to any company that wants a licence for more general reasons of efficiency or to discourage patent hold up. One respondent stated it would be helpful if patent law imposed restrictions to oblige <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners to license upstream where licensees are much fewer in number and more knowledgeable about the technology.</p>

<p>5.44.
Some respondents also stated that the Government and the CMA should provide additional guidance in respect of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing, that is equivalent to what exists in respect of the Horizontal Guidelines <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:83" rel="footnote">[footnote 83]</a></sup>. Respondents suggested such guidance would deal with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders refusing to licence potential licensees higher up the value chain and cover other matters such as the use of injunctions discussed below. Respondents said this would help new entrants and lead to significant efficiencies in the broader <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing ecosystem. One respondent also said that non-statutory guidelines should also ensure fair access to licensing opportunities by endorsing valuation principles based on the smallest saleable unit.</p>

<h3>Changes to the framework to restrict the use of injunctions</h3>

<p>5.45.
Respondents also argued for guidance, regulations or legislative change to restrict the use of injunctions. Some argued that legislative changes could include provisions to ensure no injunctions can be sought except in limited or extreme circumstances and are not used where damages would be an adequate remedy. One responded stated that where infringements have been identified, licensors can be compensated by monetary damages. Other respondents argued that guidance should ensure that there are no injunctions for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> claims, save in exceptional circumstances. This could include action by government or the CMA (e.g. through the Horizontal Guidelines).</p>

<p>5.46.
Some respondents said that rules should be introduced to ensure no enforcement actions can happen without a court order, or notice, and only after a proper hearing of the merits of claims.</p>

<h3>Proposals for introduction of “principles” governing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licencing</h3>

<p>5.47.
Respondents also proposed the <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> framework could be improved through the introduction of a number of “principles” which would benefit <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. One principle suggested was that injunctions and other exclusionary remedies should not be sought by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or allowed except in limited circumstances. The implementer or licensee is always entitled to assert claims and defences. Other principles proposed included the need to ensure when a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>-encumbered <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> is transferred, the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments follow the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> in that and all subsequent transfers. Respondents also argued that the patent holder should not require implementers to take or grant licences to a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>-encumbered <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> that is not essential to the standard, unenforceable, or not infringed, or invalid. Respondents also stated that there should be a principle to define the circumstances of a reasonable rate for a valid, infringed, and enforceable <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>-encumbered <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>. Additionally, one of the respondents argued the introduction of such principles should be adopted to overcome what they saw as damaging case law developments in the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:84" rel="footnote">[footnote 84]</a></sup> and decisions.</p>

<h3>Changes to the framework to promote transparency</h3>

<p>5.48.
Respondents also argued that significant improvements could be made to the efficiency of obtaining a licence by ensuring there was greater transparency in terms of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing rates – these issues are discussed more fully within the transparency section above.</p>

<p>5.49.
One respondent stated that there needed to be more flexibility in the UK Courts along with a legislation driven system to establish (and verify) the essentiality of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. The respondent stated that there were solutions that could be adopted, including a standardised set of licensing terms set by an SDO should be available, and if a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder then refused to provide a licence to an implementer, then interim relief in the form of an equitable declaration should be available.</p>

<p>5.50. Another respondent stated that legislation could be amended to place requirements on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to ensure there is a duty of honesty, full disclosure, good faith and transparency for implementers obtaining a licence. Another respondent argued that framework changes were required to impose a duty of candour to the IPO when standards are implicated by a patent application.</p>

<h3>Changes to the framework to endorse the use of discounts</h3>

<p>5.51.
A respondent also argued that UK <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> policy should include policy statements that announce that discounts should be acceptable as an element of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> pricing for past use of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> protected technologies. The respondent provided an illustrative example where such an approach was used by several patent pools including Avanci, which grant significant discounts for past use of the 2G/3G/4G cellular communication <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> they license.</p>

<h3>Changes to the framework to reduce the attractiveness of hold-out</h3>

<p>5.52. 
One respondent  to this question stated that a suitable framework needs to be provided to remove the attractiveness of ‘hold-out’ to an implementer and to help <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners collect their <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences without having to spend significant money and time before the courts.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 19.</strong></p>

<p>Do you have any views on any other ways of improving efficiency within the licensing landscape of SEPs?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Generally, respondents to this question agreed that there are ways to improve the efficiency of SEP licensing. Respondents provided a number of proposals for improvements summarised below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>use and access to patent pools.</strong> A number of respondents highlighted the benefits of existing patent pools and the need for the creation of new pools to improve efficiency of licensing</li>
  <li>
<strong>improvements to transparency.</strong> Respondents raised concerns about the lack of transparency of essentiality, of pricing and terms, and proposed greater transparency as a means to improve efficiency</li>
  <li>
<strong>good faith negotiations.</strong> Respondents gave differing views on how to promote good faith in negotiation</li>
  <li>
<strong>guidance around SEP licensing.</strong> A number of respondents put forward arguments to introduce SEP licensing guidance to ensure there could be improved efficiency</li>
  <li>
<strong>changes to provide access to licenses higher up the value chain, specify SSPPU as the basis for licensing or remove the effect of Unwired Planet.</strong> These proposals on which more detail is summarised elsewhere were also submitted in response to this question</li>
  <li>
<strong>other reflections.</strong> Some respondents commented on policy considerations such as the need for an evidence-based approach or lessons that could be learned from other licensing models</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Use and access to patent pools to improve efficiency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing</h3>

<p>5.53. 
A number of respondents to this question said that improvements to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing could be achieved through better use or access to patent pools.</p>

<p>5.54. 
A respondent stated that the government should promote industry-driven/market-led initiatives, such as independent patent licensing platforms or pools to improve efficiency within the licensing landscape of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>. A respondent also stated that an increase in the establishment of patent pools, and adoption of patent pool rates for technical contributions would avoid excessive rates. The respondent also stated that there should be a coordination and establishment of a unified sub-patent pool for certain technical fields to enable implementers to get authorisation quickly and without double payment. Another respondent stated that pools create an opportunity to assess the implementers ‘willingness’ to take a license, particularly if there is an infringement by an implementer, who is aware of the availability of an established patent pool license.</p>

<p>5.54. 
However, respondents stated that they had concerns around the way pools currently operate, suggesting improvements could be made that around the good faith participation and behaviour in pools. A respondent also stated that there are often multiple pools for the same technology, even the same patents, in existence. And pools generally required a certain level of expertise on the part of the potential licensee, and that expertise was not usually available at <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> or companies.  The respondent also argued that current pools are designed to cover either limited and narrow areas of technology, or focus on specific ‘verticals’ like Avanci, and are not designed to handle entire technologies like 2G, 4G or 5G. The respondent also stated that patent pools are not appropriate for supporting market entrance of new players e.g., for Open-RAN.</p>

<h3>Improvements to transparency of essentiality</h3>

<p>5.56. 
One respondent argued that the main problem of transparency is the lack of data around licensing i.e., rate data to benchmark, and not more data around <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> themselves.</p>

<p>5.57.<br>
However, several respondents proposed  improvements to transparency of essentiality as a means to improve licensing efficiency. One respondent stated problems exist with the lack of transparency around which patents are actually <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> due to the declaration requirements. This impacts on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing negotiations, which may be based on the number of patents declared as essential. The respondent also put forward proposals to overcome these concerns, which included a two-step process creating a notification stage as currently exists, and then a step that creates confirmation of essentiality. The respondent also argued that some form of sampling might be used for very large portfolios particularly to overcome  the potential cost of  confirming essentiality.</p>

<p>5.58.
Other respondents suggested the introduction of automated tools for essentiality assessments. It was proposed that such tools could generate ‘<abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> landscape assessments’ for particular standards which could then be used in licensing negotiations. The respondents also stated that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> assessments and assessors should be certified, qualified and independent of the persons performing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> assessment through an international facility to certify such persons and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are assessed in accordance with such requirements.</p>

<h3>Improvements to transparency of pricing and terms</h3>

<p>5.59.
Some respondents stated that greater pricing transparency would reduce the need for commercial negotiation and reduce disputes related to ‘non-discrimination’ aspect of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>. One respondent argued that implementers need information from <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> holders when negotiating a licence, and this doesn’t necessarily mean they are undertaking hold-out practices.</p>

<p>5.60.
Respondents stated that licensees are currently incentivised to litigate to get access to all past licensing deals of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and there should be obligations during negotiations to disclose existing relevant licensing agreements, e.g., via ‘confidentiality clubs’. Respondents argued that there should be comprehensive disclosure of past licensing information. Without this implementers are incentivised to litigate to get past licensing information to assess whether the licence offer is comparable to offers to other licensees.</p>

<p>5.61.
Another respondent argued that there should be a duty of candour on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to be honest in their negotiations and representations and efficiency could potentially be improved through the adoption of licensing negotiation groups<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:85" rel="footnote">[footnote 85]</a></sup>, particularly for <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. The respondent provided an example of chipset suppliers negotiating licences for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, and sold chipsets with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences paid, and argued that this would ensure the same price was paid for the same patents.</p>

<p>5.62.
One respondent stated that efficiency in the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing landscape could be improved by obliging <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners to announce royalties early and publicly. The respondent argued that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners should be allowed to coordinate which, due to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences being complements (not substitutes), as this would not be anti-competitive practices and should lead to lower prices. Another respondent also stated that royalty tables should be published and kept under review as to what qualifies <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate. Another respondent argued that licensors should disclose licence terms and royalty rates that allow for the evaluation of comparable licences.</p>

<p>5.63.
Some responses argued a role for <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> to provide greater pricing transparency. In particular, a respondent stated that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> should be responsible for approving a pricing structure for each <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> with the patentee, while another respondent argued that there is a need for <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, along with governments and courts to encourage <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to disclose sufficient information before seeking a licence.</p>

<p>5.64. One respondent said that confidentiality provisions of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> license made price discovery difficult for both licensors and licensees, but said that pre-litigation discovery accessible to each party’s legal representation, could in some cases enable more efficient resolution without litigation or arbitration. Other respondents also argued that measures aimed at avoiding the use overly-restrictive terms in non-disclosure agreements should be considered.</p>

<h3>Good faith negotiations to improve efficiency in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing</h3>

<p>5.65. 
One respondent referred to their view that the licensing framework affirmed in Huawei v. ZTE provides sufficient clarity, legal certainty, and balance in negotiations in response to this question. They added that a number of jurisdictions also expect that businesses undertake due diligence before launching products which implement third party <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, and that this should be a relatively simple exercise in the open standards environment.</p>

<p>5.66.
However, a number of respondents representing a range of stakeholder groups put forward arguments and proposals around the principle of good faith negotiations as a means of improving efficiency. Generally, <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders argued that there should be certain deterrents available to prevent bad faith by licensors or licensees. This could include the introduction of policy, which focusses on facilitating negotiated outcomes e.g., add a punitive element for bad faith behaviour by licensors or licensees; or creating an account controlled by a third party into which implementer should transfer reasonable amounts agreed by the parties or a neutral third party, after an implementer has declined a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> offer. One respondent argued that improvements can be made by addressing the conduct by certain potential licensees that is contrary to good faith negotiation and which delays the conclusion of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences.</p>

<p>5.67.
Other responses raised concerns about the conduct of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Some respondents said that the availability of the threat of injunction incentivises <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to paint the licensee as unwilling in negotiations and to then pressure the licensee into a non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> deal. One respondent who argued this referred to the (then ongoing) US case of Koninklijke Philips v Thales DIS<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:86" rel="footnote">[footnote 86]</a></sup>, whereby the implementer agreed to take a global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence determined by a US court, but the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder still sought an injunction (“exclusion order”) with the International Trade Commission.</p>

<p>5.68.
One respondent who raised this concern stated that the legal attributes of the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence statement should be clarified, and efforts should be made to balance the interests of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, patent holders, standard implementers and consumers. The respondent also commented that if the implementer is required to negotiate in good faith, then there should be clear and exemplary guidelines on compliance or violation of the obligation to negotiate in good faith. Another respondent stated that clarity and stability on issues such the availability of injunctions would help to make <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing more efficient and predictable. Other respondents stated that there needs to be an enforced obligation for the patent holder to negotiate in good faith, to improve the efficiency of licensing.</p>

<p>5.69.
Some respondents related the issue of good faith in negotiations to transparency. One respondent said that licensees should engage reasonably with a licensor and should not needlessly delay discussions, but also stated that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders fail to provide the necessary information to potential licensees to determine whether the alleged <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are infringed and that the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder’s offer is <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>. Another respondent argued that greater transparency supports good faith negotiations, which could include an obligation for full disclosure of all relevant facts concerning the validity and essentiality of patents in a portfolio, along with details of the relevant standards landscapes and the basis upon which rates are calculated. The respondent further argued that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders could provide a warranty, undertaking or representation that they are offering a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence.</p>

<p>5.70.
One respondent argued that it was important to understand the difference in obligations between parties, particularly for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, who have made contractual commitments to license on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms, while potential licensees do not. Therefore, the respondent argued that there needs to be a focus on whether the licensees so called “willingness” to licensee’s as a test for whether injunctive relief is appropriate, is misplaced.</p>

<h3>“License to all”, SSPPU basis for royalty rates, and removing the effect of Unwired Planet</h3>

<p>5.71.
One respondent stated that there were a number of ways of improving licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> to promote the public policy of restoring the right balance of negotiation equality as a measure of fairness and remove discrimination. The respondent argued that ‘licence to all’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:87" rel="footnote">[footnote 87]</a></sup> will help ensure fully licensed components are available to integrators, which will in turn facilitate market entry by new, innovative players and <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> in the IoT sector. The respondent further stated that a ‘license to all’ <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> policy will enable <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> to grow and invest in their business, without fearing patent infringement claims based on components from their SSPPU suppliers. The respondent also argued that using SSPPU as basis for royalty rates and cross-checking <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates with a top-down approach and that upstream licensing should be made more efficient and safer for a business.</p>

<p>5.72.
Another respondent argued that changes should be made to the Patents Act 1977 to improve the way the current <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing landscape operates and remove the effect of the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:88" rel="footnote">[footnote 88]</a></sup>) case. This would reduce the volume of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> court action in the UK.</p>

<h3>Better dispute resolution mechanisms</h3>

<p>5.73.
One respondent stated that efficiency could be improved in the licensing landscape if dispute resolution, including litigation, is made more accessible for large and small companies. Some stated that the evaluation of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates should be available without the need to litigate, but did not see the availability of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates being resolved through alternative dispute resolution (ADR)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:89" rel="footnote">[footnote 89]</a></sup>, as these were considered equally as expensive and complex and do not have the benefit of transparency that litigation has.</p>

<p>5.74.
A respondent argued that the way legal frameworks and courts operate in this area required earlier access to judicial assessment of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms, swifter UK court procedures for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing disputes and greater use of ADR. The respondent also argued that an international tribunal for determination of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms on a voluntary contractual basis could provide an alternative route to resolution of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> disputes and improve efficiency of licensing.</p>

<h3>Further guidance and information around <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing</h3>

<p>5.75.
A respondent stated that there needed to be more publicly available guidance and information, particularly for smaller entities to overcome the secrecy in licensing negotiations. Another respondent suggested that there needs to be guidance that educates <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> and new users of standardised technologies on relevant case law and clarify the obligations on both parties to come to a negotiated licence. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder also stated that efficiency could be improved for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing, if there were improvements to the understanding of the technology itself and the standardisation process by which it was developed. The respondent also stated that awareness of the requirements and availability to license new products and services was needed, along with support around use of third-party expert services and intelligence reports where an implementer lacks technical expertise or industry knowledge.</p>

<p>5.76.
A respondent stated that <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> are at a greater risk of striking unfavourable licensing terms due to their lack of resources, and the respondent proposes that guidelines on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> from independent policy makers or courts would be useful to provide a measure of clarity to negotiating parties. The respondent also referenced the approach the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has undertaken in respect of issuing guidelines as a useful example.</p>

<p>5.77.
A respondent also argued that there should be small business-focused education and resources on standards and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing issues, and that the IPO could also hold targeted listening sessions and consultations to educate and take in feedback.</p>

<h3>CEN/CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation) reports and guidance</h3>

<p>5.78.
Responses to this question also included support and opposition to the adoption of CEN/CENELEC reports and guidance. One respondent stated that any guidance on existing practices in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing, should be considered in contrast to the CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement Report (CWA9500). The respondent, criticised this report, stating it was a policy document targeted at devaluing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> to reduce short term costs for implementers of standardised technologies without any regard for the detrimental long-term effects on standardisation and consumer benefits that this would cause.</p>

<p>5.79.
Another respondent argued that sufficient guidance on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing is included in the CEN/CENELEC multi stakeholder report “Core Principles and Approaches for Licensing of Standard Essential Patents”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:90" rel="footnote">[footnote 90]</a></sup>. Another respondent also stated that the focus should remain on high-level principles to ensure efficient and good faith licensing and the timely conclusion of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences and align to those set out in the CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement, CWA 17431<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:91" rel="footnote">[footnote 91]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.80.
Another respondent argued that the UK government should provide guidance on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing which can reflect the key principles included in the CEN/CENELEC Workshop Agreement Report (CWA9500)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:92" rel="footnote">[footnote 92]</a></sup>. The respondent also stated that guidance principles to improve efficiency in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing should include injunctions only being permitted and available in limited circumstances. The respondent also argued that there should be a principle that prevents <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders from leveraging the courts of a single jurisdiction to force a licensee into a global portfolio licensing through the threat of an injunction (the respondent arguing that this is a form of hold-up). The respondent further stated that a principle to ensure <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> valuations bear a reasonable relationship to the economic value of the IPR should be adopted. The respondent also argued that principles should deal with royalty rates focusing on the smallest component that practices the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>, not the end product, a right for licensees to challenge the essentiality, validity, and infringement of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, and principles to ensure <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders do not refuse licences to component suppliers and other companies making devices that practice standardised technologies.</p>

<h3>Reflections on different licensing models</h3>

<p>5.81.
One respondent argued that the licensing model of Bluetooth, for example, is a highly efficient standard, widely accepted, and continues to innovate without conflicts. The respondent argued that the Bluetooth model in contrast to the model associated with ETSI standards, for example, is not associated with a large number of licensing disputes ending up in expensive global litigation.</p>

<p>5.82.
Another respondent promoted the use of open standards, without the use of patents. Where this was not possible alternative approaches should be considered to allow unhindered access to the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> such as an encumbrance on the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> in regard to open source software or the inclusion of a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> in a patent pool.</p>

<h3>Comments on the policy approach</h3>

<p>5.83.
One respondent emphasised getting the policy considerations right, aside from discussing specific proposals. They stated that although policy considerations may give rise to many different licensing solutions, such policy considerations should be supported by good evidence, especially where they may harm the value of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> or incentives to contribute to technology standards. The respondent also argued that improvements to the efficiency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing should enable wide adoption of standardised technologies, and ensure an adequate return to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders based on the market value of the patented technology to its users.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 20.</strong></p>

<p>Would better use and access to patent pools offer improved efficiency around SEPs licensing? Or would greater use/access create barriers for innovators if there were limitations introduced i.e., cross-licensing?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Many respondents provided comments on the benefits that patent pools can bring to SEP licensing, or added observations on promoting their use or access, as well as commenting on cross-licensing. The different themes in the responses were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>benefits of patent pools.</strong> Various respondents stated that patent pools improve the efficiency of SEP licensing</li>
  <li>
<strong>patent pools should not be mandated.</strong> Many respondents said that patent pools should not be mandated, rather it should be a voluntary licensing option that complements bilateral licensing</li>
  <li>
<strong>multiple patent pools and access to standards.</strong> Some respondents suggested that the existence of multiple patent pools for the same standard may bring difficulties in SEP licensing</li>
  <li>
<strong>patent pools and licensing practises.</strong> Various respondents argued that certain licensing practises may cause problems in patent pools</li>
  <li>
<strong>patent pools, governance, and transparency.</strong> Some respondents suggested there could be greater transparency in relation to patent pools and its governance</li>
  <li>
<strong>patent pools and anti-competitive conduct.</strong> One respondent pointed to potential anti-competitive behaviour as an inherent risk to patent pools</li>
  <li>
<strong>cross-licensing.</strong> Three respondents commented on introducing a limitation such as cross-licensing</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Benefits of patent pools</h4>

<p>5.84.
Many respondents stated that patent pools can improve the efficiency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing by reducing associated licensing costs. One respondent said that if an increase in the efficiency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing brings appropriate royalty rates for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, then this can help incentivise R&amp;D and standard development. One respondent stated that patent pools can reduce delays in litigation. They added that patent pools can accelerate the adoption of technologies and the promotion competition in downstream markets, thereby making new technologies more accessible to consumers. One respondent added that patent pools related to MPEG video codecs are a good example of where patent pools work well. Another respondent gave the example of audio recording. Although, even in these well-defined areas, one implementer added that it takes years for pools to reach a critical mass of relevant patents and that this timeline would be exacerbated in more complex technology areas such as 5G.</p>

<p>5.85.
Several respondents pointed toward the presence of essentiality checks for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> within patent pools as a benefit. However, one respondent stated that, although most patent pools conduct essentiality checks for some or all patents offered to a pool, the assessments can be costly, and those costs need to be considered. They added that, for larger pools, the higher cost may lead to only a sample of patents checked for essentiality. Several respondents said that patent pools can make the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem more transparent, particularly regarding publishing information related to licensing negotiations. Two respondents suggest that patent pools provide transparency of licensing rates and other terms as those details are sometimes made public on the patent pool’s website. Some respondents stated that patent pools can reduce the effect of royalty stacking.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:93" rel="footnote">[footnote 93]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.86.
Some respondents, from a variety of different stakeholder groups, suggested that patent pools are more effective in technology areas that are well-defined and specific as opposed to complex technology areas. One respondent stated that this is due to patent pools compensating their participants based on pure patent counts or a similar mechanism. This respondent added that such a model creates incentives for patent owners who believe they own more valuable assets to stay out of pools to prevent others from benefitting from their assets. Inferring that patent pools are more suitable where the contribution of individual patents to the value created by the technology is relatively even.</p>

<h4>Patent pools should not be mandated</h4>

<p>5.87.
Several respondents stated that licensing through patent pools should remain voluntary and only as an alternative to licensing through bilateral agreements. One respondent added that patent pools should not be mandatory as it may raise concerns regarding article 28 of the TRIPS Agreement<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:94" rel="footnote">[footnote 94]</a></sup>. Suggesting that mandatory licensing may affect rights conferred by the patent owner. Some respondents proposed that market forces and market participants should decide who joins and what terms and conditions are employed by patent pools. One respondent added that competition law requires the option of bilateral licences to be available.</p>

<p>5.88. 
One licensing administrator said that forcing <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to participate in patent pools could result in licensing rates that are not as efficient as they would be in pools that are formed through voluntary participation. Another respondent stated that in their experience it is normal for a licensee to prefer negotiating bilaterally as it allows greater flexibility within the terms. They added that there are no notable examples of successful patent pools related to the licensing of smartphones as they are usually licensed through bilateral agreements.</p>

<h4>Multiple patent pools and access to standards</h4>

<p>5.89.
Some respondents stated that the existence of multiple patent pools covering the same standard can be problematic for negotiating <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences. One respondent added that this can undermine the efficiency and certainty that patent pools could bring to licensing negotiations. Further, one respondent added that this may lead to duplicative royalty demands that do not consider the aggregate royalty burden for a standard.  As a result, this may act as a barrier to accessing a standard. Another respondent, a legal services provider, stated that for certain products that inherently incorporate several different standards, providers of these products may need to enter into multiple patent pools. One respondent offered a potential solution to limiting the number of patent pools for a standard, suggesting that it may be more helpful to license out a critical mass of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> relevant to a given standard. They added that a critical mass of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> may also generate a benchmark for reasonable licensing fees for other pools.</p>

<h3>Patent pools and licensing practises</h3>

<p>5.90.
In contrast to the benefits stated, several respondents said there were problems created by patent pool licensing terms and practises. One respondent, an implementer, stated that patent pools or licensing platforms that refuse to license higher in the value chain do not improve efficiency in the ecosystem. Rather to the contrary, it only encourages friction and litigation. Some respondents stated that patent pools may increase the total licensing costs for smaller <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders with relatively small portfolios. One respondent added that this is due to an increased admin cost  which <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders hope would be offset by a higher uptake in licences. Some respondents said that patent pools can create an incentive to over-declare. They explained that if a pool’s rate is set by the patent owners, there is an incentive to include non-essential patents in the pool and set the rate too high.</p>

<p>5.91.
Some respondents, including a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and a licensing administrator, state that patent hold-out and the unwillingness of licensees to engage in licensing negotiations appear to be issues that patent pools have not tackled. Within these responses reference was made to the Continental v. Avanci case, stating that despite the increased efficiency that patent pools bring, combined with the availability of price information, some implementers have not been willing to accept or negotiate <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms with patent pools<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:95" rel="footnote">[footnote 95]</a></sup>. One respondent added that patent pools can sometimes be in a worse position than <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners if they do not have a right to bring proceedings to enforce the patents in the pool.</p>

<p>5.92.
Some respondents said that patent pools represent a concentration of economic power and must be carefully controlled to avoid market distortion or monopoly behaviour. Some respondents, mostly implementers, stated that licensing within patent pools should be based on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> principles as required in bilateral licensing arrangements. One respondent, an implementer, suggested that aggregate rate setting during the standard setting process would eliminate most of the problems identified above. Another respondent, a legal services provider, suggested that the existence of patent pools may be a sign of some degree of market failure regarding low uptake of licences by implementers and/or other frictions in the wider licensing environment.</p>

<h4>Patent pools, governance, and transparency</h4>

<p>5.93.
One implementer stated that patent pool administrators should be independent, meaning that they do not own any patents in the pool, to avoid any conflict of interest. The same respondent added that there should be transparency on the level of fiscal ownership and asset ownership between <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders (in a patent pool) during pre-licensing discussions.</p>

<p>5.94.
Some respondents stated that, in the interest of transparency, patent pools should publish all their licensing terms including royalty rates, claim charts and other terms and conditions. They state that usually patent pools demand to take a licence before disclosing such information.</p>

<p>5.95.
One respondent added that both patent pool administrators (e.g., sub licensors or licensing agents) and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensors should be transparent about any licences granted to suppliers or customers in the supply chain of a multicomponent product. The respondent added that the administrators should collaborate with potential pool licensees to assess which licences already exist with the licensee’s direct or indirect suppliers and its customers. Following this assessment, the pool administrator should adjust the royalty rate accordingly to avoid ‘double-dipping’. Further, one respondent stated that patent pools should be obliged to disclose licensing conditions that at least cover “most favourable royalty rate” clauses which, in turn, would prohibit patent pools from granting licences that have different royalty rates to similarly situated licensees.</p>

<h4>Patent pools and anti-competitive conduct</h4>

<p>5.96.
Respondents stated that there is risk of patent pools being exploited for anti-trust or anti-competitive conduct such as the fixing of prices or sharing of confidential information relating to licensees and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. One respondent added that the greatest care should be taken to avoid this. However, specific examples of this were not provided in response to this question.</p>

<p>5.97.
One respondent, a legal services provider, stated that patent pools are not popular among <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders due to disagreements on various subjects, including mechanisms for royalty sharing and on the quality of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolios. However, they added that having essentiality checks could mitigate and incentivise patent pools.</p>

<h4>Cross-licensing</h4>

<p>5.98.
Respondents commented on cross-licensing, where two or more parties both agree to license their respective <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> to one another. One respondent stated that cross-licensing should not be seen as problematic as it allows rights holders to use their patent portfolio in a defensive manner and balance out licensing demands.</p>

<p>5.99.
Some respondents stated that introducing limitations to cross licensing may be complicated. One respondent added that a cross-licensing limitation may delay the taking of licences as there are different bargaining levels between different <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Therefore, they suggest that this type of negotiation is best left to bilateral discussions between parties. They continue to add that cross licences can be dealt with efficiently by patent pools through ‘pre-netting’ or ‘post-netting’ to account for pre-existing licensed patents such as cross licences. However, another respondent added that that cross-licensing, as opposed to greater use or access,  would act as a barrier to new entrants who may have little to cross-license and, therefore, may result in reduced competition.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 21.</strong></p>

<p>How are patent pools best created? To what extent should States, SDOs or other appropriate entities be involved (or excluded) from setting up patent pools?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Many respondents, including licensing administrators and some SEP holders, provided comments. The different themes in the responses were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>the best way to create patent pools.</strong> Various respondents gave recommendations on how patent pools are best created and commented on attributes that make patent pools successful</li>
  <li>
<strong>role of States and SDOs in the creation of patent pools.</strong> Several respondents said that mandatory creation of patent pools would be problematic, although some said that SDOs or States could have a partial role to play</li>
  <li>
<strong>patent pools and the role of competition authorities and law.</strong>  Various respondents suggested that competition authorities have a role to play regarding patent pools</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>The best way to create patent pools</h4>

<p>5.100. 
Respondents stated that patent pools are created to respond to market needs. One respondent explained that in deciding whether or not to join a pool, a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder usually considers its business model, the standardised technology involved, the distribution of the collected royalties and whether it already has a licensing program in place for such technology.</p>

<p>5.101. 
Several respondents stated that patent pools should be created and/or maintained by an independent company or organisation. Respondents added that, in some cases, an independent company may itself take the lead in approaching patent holders to create a patent pool. Further, one respondent stated that having an independent company run the patent pool provides a single interface for prospective licensees, leading to advantages in respect of efficiency and confidentiality.</p>

<p>5.102. 
Some respondents stated that the setting up of patent pools is best left to licensing administrators. Respondents added that patent pools are not easy to create and require very specialised administration. One respondent added that patent pools require a fine balance between the commercial interests of the participants, and the ability to offer pool rates and licensing efficiencies which outweigh the alternative bilateral licensing for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners and implementers alike. Further stating that this requires careful commercial judgment, negotiation, and a great deal of industry experience.</p>

<p>5.103. 
One licensing administrator responded to say that creating a successful patent pool is related to the skill of the licensing administrator in finding and bringing together the right mix of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Further, that the success of the patent pool’s business may be determined by its ability to attract implementers to take licences voluntarily, which in turn will depend in large part on the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> coverage and quality of the pool’s offering, in addition to the rates and other terms.</p>

<p>5.104. 
Some respondents have pointed toward the success of patent pools that have been established at an early stage and have included a large proportion of patents relevant for a standard. One respondent suggested pools such as the MPEG-LA pools in the audio-video area and the Avanci pool for licensing cellular patents to the automotive industry are good examples of this. Another respondent added that patent pools should be established before a standard has become mature and should announce licence rate and conditions at that stage.</p>

<h4>Role of States and <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> in the creation of patent pools</h4>

<p>5.105. 
Several respondents stated that mandatory creation of pools would be problematic. One respondent added that mandatory patent pools risk questions over its management, control, and its legality. Further stating that this model would require patent holders to license their patents, which would in effect become a compulsory licence. One respondent, an industry body, added that this would go against patent holder’s rights and the fundamental principles of the patent system itself.</p>

<p>5.106. 
One respondent highlighted the political complications that may arise should a State be involved with the creation of a patent pool. They explained that there may be a risk that States favour a particular stakeholder group based on the stakeholder representation within their state and may produce policies to that effect. Another respondent said that if States create patent pools, it is likely that certain technologies may become nationalised to certain geographical areas. Adding that the independence of patent pool formation helps to maintain the priorities of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> without distraction.</p>

<p>5.107. 
Several respondents stated that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> should not have a commercial role in the formation of patent pools. Respondents added that most <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> promote neutrality and state that they must be far removed from any kind of commercial involvement. One respondent stated that, in their view, a patent pool is an entirely commercial arrangement and patent pools should not be subject to regulatory involvement provided they abide by competition law principles. Further, another respondent, provided an example stating that <abbr title="European Telecommunications Standard Institute">ETSI’s</abbr> IPR Policy and Guide on IPRs make clear that commercial issues regarding IPRs are not to be discussed within ETSI. Adding that any potential promotion of patent pools’ formation by <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> would contradict their role. Two respondents commented further stating that the <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>’ primary purpose and interest is developing technical standards. Adding that competition law concerns would increase if <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> were not only agreeing to set technical requirements between competitors, but also setting the commercial terms of access to the standard. On the same theme, a licensing administrator pointed toward the potential confusion that may occur if <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> were involved in both standard setting and patent pool formation. Adding that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers may see participation in a patent pool as mandatory which may act to deter participation.</p>

<p>5.108. 
However, many respondents suggested that States or <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could have a partial role regarding patent pools. Respondents stated that States or <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> may support or encourage the creation of patent pools, but they should not be involved in the formation of the pool. Some respondents added that there may be a role for the State and/or <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> in providing guidance regarding suitable terms and structure for a patent pool. One respondent explained that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could help by providing clear guidance on what fair and reasonable rates are in relation to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing within patent pools. Another respondent, a legal services representative, states that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> may facilitate the voluntary creation of patent pools, for example, by allowing a certain number of licensee members to request the creation of a pool for a certain standard or selecting a few patent pool management companies, which will work with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners on the creation of the patent pool. Several respondents pointed toward DVB is an example of an SDO that supports the creation of patent pools. However, one respondent highlighted that though DVB is an SDO, it is important to note that it does not administer the patent pools itself.</p>

<h4>Patent pools and the role of competition authorities and law</h4>

<p>5.109. 
Several respondents, from a variety of stakeholder groups, stated that competition authorities have a role in establishing competition frameworks to ensure patent pool competition law compliance and their pro-competitive effects. One respondent added that authorities can encourage patent pools by providing “safe harbour” comfort letters to provide assurance that the relevant pool will overall be beneficial to competition and therefore will not be the subject of competition authority enforcement action provided the pool operates as promised. Another respondent stated that competition authorities have a role in ensuring that patent pools abide by their members’ <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments. They added that competition authorities should also promote relevant existing guidance in competition law as well as the enforcement of competition and contract law where patent pools fail to abide by the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitments of their members. Some respondents stated that the UK Government should look carefully at the behaviour of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensor pools under UK competition laws and should study the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing ecosystem to track <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensor pool behaviours and their impact on competition.</p>

<p><strong>Question 22.</strong></p>

<p>Are there alternative ways to address disputes on pricing mechanisms? For example, what point in the value chain provides an economic basis to calculate rates payable?</p>

<p><strong>Question 23.</strong></p>

<p>How could schemes where there are specific definitions of what costs are allowable (percentage limits etc.) best be utilised?</p>

<p><strong>Summary of themes:</strong></p>

<p>Responses gave ideas on the best way to resolve disputes around pricing of SEP licences. Different views were given on how the FRAND commitment should be interpreted, and whether use of specific pricing schemes would offer improvement on methods currently used in courts. The main themes were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>‘license to all’ vs ‘access to all’.</strong> Differing views were given on whether the FRAND commitment should be interpreted as requiring all entities in a value chain to be able to obtain a licence</li>
  <li>
<strong>use of SEP pricing mechanisms.</strong> Some argued use of specific pricing mechanisms could limit flexibility and that focus should remain on high-level principles, whilst others gave examples of pricing mechanisms they believed could improve licensing efficiency</li>
  <li>
<strong>economic basis for calculating rates payable.</strong> Some argued end product price is the appropriate basis for calculating rates payable, while others argued that the selling price of the smallest saleable component of a product that implements the SEP should be used</li>
  <li>
<strong>examples of SEP pricing mechanisms.</strong> Various examples of pricing mechanisms were discussed by respondents, including SSPPU, percentage limit schemes, fixed, per unit schemes and schemes defining costs allowable</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>License to all’ vs ‘access to all’</h4>

<p>5.110.
Some responded that it is industry practice to interpret the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment as requiring <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to make standardised technology accessible to all, and that this does not require licensing all members of the value chain. These respondents suggested it is more appropriate for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to choose a single point in the value chain to license their patents.</p>

<p>5.111.
Some argued transaction costs are reduced by licensing at a single point in the value chain. One responded that due to the intricacy and interchangeability of components within a value chain, monitoring licensed and unlicensed products is only feasible at the end product level. Furthermore, the respondent stated that compliance to technical standards can only be confirmed at the end product level according to IPR policies of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, and that the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment therefore does not apply to components that could be used in non-standard compliant products.</p>

<p>5.112.
Others responded that there cannot be a requirement to license to all due to issues of patent exhaustion. Responses explained that because a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder’s patent rights may be terminated (‘exhausted’) after a supplier sells a component covered by a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> license, the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder cannot claim further royalties downstream. Respondents argued this prevents <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders from licensing to more than one supplier in the value chain. Patent exhaustion is discussed further in section 2 on competition and market functioning, and earlier in this section.</p>

<p>5.113.
Others responded that not all entities in the value chain need to have a licence, due to granting of ‘have-made’ rights. These “permit a licensee to have an unlicensed third party make a licensed product for the licensee”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:96" rel="footnote">[footnote 96]</a></sup>. A licensee therefore has the right not only to make but to ‘have made’ the technology covered by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>, by an unlicensed third party such as a component manufacturer. Responses argued that this means licensing at the end product level does not restrict component suppliers’ freedom to operate, so long as their customers are licensed.</p>

<p>5.114.
On the other hand, some responded that licences should not be limited to a specific level of the value chain, but rather SDO policies should ensure implementers at any level are entitled to obtain a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> license (‘license to all’) . Some responded that if licences continue to be refused to upstream component suppliers, this could damage their ability to innovate on top of a standard. One implementer responded that where component suppliers are not able to obtain a licence to the relevant standards they implement, they are unable to indemnify their customers for patent infringement. They responded that this makes their customers hesitant to purchase their components, disrupting the process of product innovation and potentially delaying the adoption of IoT. This is discussed further in section 2 on competition and market functioning.</p>

<p>5.115.
One responded that eliminating or limiting <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders’ obligation to license their <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> to all third parties would conflict with the legal situation in other jurisdictions, where this principle has been upheld in court rulings<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:97" rel="footnote">[footnote 97]</a></sup>. It explained that UK suppliers would be disadvantaged if their foreign competitors were able to obtain licences and they were not, potentially causing the UK to fall behind in the 5G, automotive and IoT sectors . Some responded that allowing wider access to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences would help new entrants in the component manufacturing industry and reduce the risk of monopoly, benefiting competition. A multi-organisation response argued that this would aid the Government’s plan to increase vendor diversity in the 5G marketplace.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> pricing mechanisms</h4>

<p>5.116.
Some responded that a pre-prescribed basis for setting licensing rates should not be used, and that in disputes this should be left to court judgement. Some pointed to the method of benchmarking comparable licences to obtain a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate as the best approach, as is often used in court adjudications. Others responded that focus should remain on high-level principles to ensure efficient and good faith licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.117.
A wide range of stakeholders, including <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers, responded against introducing more specifically defined pricing methodologies. Responses stated that these could risk creating a one-size fits all solution that does not provide sufficient flexibility to account for future shifts in market, and could otherwise impede efficient licensing. One <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder responded that since <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> uses vary widely within a sector, assessment of a fair return should not make use of formalised methodologies or rules.</p>

<p>5.118.
Others responded that where specific methods are used to calculate royalties, these should be transparent. A consultancy firm responded that definitions of how proposed royalties are calculated should be provided to all licensees, irrespective of the size of licensee. An industry body responded that this would improve ease of comparability exercises, and a legal services body responded that this would provide greater clarity and understanding regarding an acceptable level of royalties. Others evaluated specific examples of pricing mechanisms, discussed below.</p>

<h4>Economic basis for calculating rates payable</h4>

<p>5.119.
Some responded, including some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and other non-implementer stakeholders, that it is the norm in most industries to use end product price as the economic basis for calculating rates payable, and that this should continue to be followed. One referred to the case of Conversant v Daimler<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:98" rel="footnote">[footnote 98]</a></sup> as guidance on calculating <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties based on standard-enabled features of an end product. One academic responded that end product pricing minimises disputes, as sales revenue is an objective measure that is easy to confirm and difficult to manipulate. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and implementer responded that using the end product as the basis for pricing a licence ensures valuations consider the contributions by standardised technology to the consumer experience of the product or service.</p>

<p>5.120.
Most <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and some other respondents argued against use of SSPPU to set royalty rates. According to this valuation method, the economic basis for calculating rates payable is the selling price of the smallest saleable component of a product that implements the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>, such as the microchip in a cellular device. Some responded that this could result in below-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties, and others provided examples of cases where the practice has been explicitly rejected in European and US courts<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:99" rel="footnote">[footnote 99]</a></sup>. One responded that it is a matter of indifference at which point in the value chain the royalty rate is determined, since firms can adjust the percentage royalty to reflect the technological contribution of the licensed <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolio.</p>

<p>5.121.
On the other hand, several implementers and some other respondents argued that SSPPU is the best method for calculating <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties. They responded that this ensures royalties reflect the value added by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>, and not the value of any further end product innovation by the implementer, for example related to product quality and brand. Where the end product is used as the base for calculating rates payable, some responses argued this acts as a tax on end product innovation and dampens incentives to invest in new markets. One implementer argued SSPPU is the most logical approach for wireless communication standards, where the standard is substantially implemented higher in the value chain with little further value added downstream.</p>

<h4>Percentage limit schemes</h4>

<p>5.122.
Several responses argued against use of percentage limit schemes, which cap royalty payments to a percentage of some defined cost. A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder pointed to a test by Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance (NGMN) that found percentage limits negotiated by patent holders to be significantly above actual royalty rates later agreed by market participants, therefore having no effect. It also found that the process of collecting information from patent holders to inform percentage limits was difficult under competition law, and that the cost and time involved could impact the success of evolving markets negatively.</p>

<p>5.123.
A licensing administrator responded that use of percentage limits raises the issue of selecting an appropriate base by which to multiply the percentage rate. It responded that this issue can be avoided by specifying royalty rates as fixed prices, not percentages.</p>

<h4>Fixed, per unit schemes</h4>

<p>5.124.
Some responded that offering a fixed royalty per unit is preferable to use of percentage limits, giving the example of Avanci licensing 4G technology at a rate of $15 per car. A legal services firm responded that defining an overall royalty stack for a given standard combined with an allocation depending on the strength of each <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owner’s portfolio would provide clarity, transparency and predictability in terms of maximum rates for a given portfolio. An implementer responded that reasonable and transparent per unit royalties have been proven to spur widespread use of standards, though it did not provide further evidence or sources in support of this statement.</p>

<p>5.125.
An industry body responded that <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could encourage <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to charge fixed dollar amounts per end-user unit (e.g. $1 per device). One implementer suggested the IPO consider the proposal of a rate setting board, that could assist in making a public determination regarding the marginal value a particular standard creates in a device.</p>

<h4>Schemes defining costs allowable</h4>

<p>5.126.
A <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder responded that in some industries it is common practice to place a ‘cap’ (upper limit) on royalties. It explained that this can avoid elements of a product unrelated to the standard being used as a basis for valuation. If there were no royalty cap, it exampled that the manufacturer of a smartphone made of gold would pay far higher royalties for a 5G license based on product cost, whilst gaining no additional benefit from 5G connectivity compared to a regular smartphone. However, it explained that certain product features may derive more value from standards, such as camera-enabled smartphones benefiting from picture-sharing enabled by cellular standards. It argued that royalty caps, if used, should allow royalties to reflect this additional value. Another respondent argued against use of cost-based pricing altogether, on the grounds that the value of a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> is not necessarily related to the cost of manufacturing a product.</p>

<p>5.127.
Some responded that greater detail on what costs are allowable in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing would support <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> evaluation and comparability exercises by prospective licensees, increasing efficiencies and driving down costs for consumers. A Chinese industry body suggested that economic experts, technical experts and key industry players should decide which costs should be used to calculate royalties, with review by courts.</p>

<p>5.128.
Some responded to question 23 with consideration of costs incurred by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder. An implementer suggested that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders should be compensated for the costs of developing technology, including patent costs and a portion of R&amp;D expenditures, plus a reasonable profit on invested sum. A legal services respondent suggested that additional service charges above and beyond agreed royalty rates should be avoided.</p>

<h4>Benefits of national courts determining the terms of global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences</h4>

<p>6.1.
 In the UK, courts have been prepared to determine the terms of a global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence, as seen in the UK Supreme Court decision in the Unwired Planet v Huawei<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:100" rel="footnote">[footnote 100]</a></sup> case. Respondents raised a variety of benefits and drawbacks of national courts determining global licences.</p>

<p>6.2. 
A number of respondents said the setting of global licensing rates by national courts can be more efficient than pursuing litigation in multiple jurisdictions, with references made to efficiencies of time and/or cost. One of these respondents stated that litigating country by country is unrealistic and would enable an implementer to avoid paying <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> royalties. Another of these respondents said that if parties agree to international arbitration, this could be a particularly efficient way of setting global rates. One respondent said it is more convenient to calculate rates for a global market. This respondent also suggested this helps both licensors and licensees check the licence rates and whether they are being paid. Some respondents commented that national court judgments provide a transparent approach that could be used as guidance by others in the setting of global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates. Some respondents suggested that the setting of global rates by national courts can provide certainty and finality to parties in licensing disputes.</p>

<p>6.3.
Several respondents commented that global licensing decisions by national courts reflect, or would reflect, industry practice in these circumstances. Some of these respondents said <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing is generally done on a global basis. One of these respondents said that global licences set by national courts are the only option if parties will not agree to enter into arbitration. Some respondents also generally supported the approach UK courts have taken in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes or with regards to global licensing. One respondent stated that the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:101" rel="footnote">[footnote 101]</a></sup> decision is likely to strengthen the attractiveness of the UK as a jurisdiction for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders.</p>

<p>6.4. 
On the other hand, several respondents said national courts should not be able to compel a party to global licensing without their consent. However, some of these respondents said that global licences decided by national courts can have benefits and should be available when both parties consent. Some respondents were concerned about implementers being ‘forced’ to accept a global licence by a UK court as a result of non-UK patents or when the implementer’s links to the UK are ‘minor’. Some, however, stated that in the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:102" rel="footnote">[footnote 102]</a></sup> decision the court was not ‘forcing’ an implementer to agree to a global licence. The implementer had the choice of being subject to a UK limited injunction or taking the licence.</p>

<h4>Drawbacks of national courts determining the terms of global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences</h4>

<p>6.5.
The most stated drawback among respondents was that forum shopping and a ‘race to the court’ may result due to divergence in the approaches of different national courts and/or the perception of a national court being favourable to certain parties. Some of these respondents reported that this may result in uncertainty for implementers and ASIs. Some respondents said that some national courts may change their procedures to attract litigants or may make decisions that favour certain parties.</p>

<p>6.6. A number of respondents made comments relating to court mandated global licences being, or potentially being, jurisdictional over-reach. Some of these respondents said these decisions impinge on the ability of national courts to govern the intellectual property rights or licensing rates of their jurisdiction. Several respondents commented that such decisions result in national courts making judgements on foreign patents despite the foreign patents being outside the jurisdiction of those national courts. Some respondents stated national courts may lack the expertise or information relating to foreign patents and sales to make decisions on global licences.</p>

<p>6.7. 
Some respondents said that these decisions undermine the ability of potential licensees to challenge patents of a different jurisdiction. A few respondents said these decisions would discourage legal challenges by implementers that would curtail exploitative practices and ultimately benefit customers. Some respondents also stated that global licensing decisions by national courts invert traditional legal burdens requiring <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to establish infringement and defend challenges to their patents.</p>

<p>6.8.
Some reported drawbacks of national courts setting global licensing rates related to the effect or influence these decisions may have on potential licensees. A number of respondents raised concerns about parties using the threat of litigation or an injunction to coerce a potential licensee into a global licence that is not <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> or not needed, and that licensees may not have the resources to challenge. Some of these respondents specifically referred to <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. Some respondents commented that the decisions made by UK courts may influence the decision of an innovator to be present in the UK market and threaten innovation by UK businesses.</p>

<p>6.9.
Some respondents said the approach taken by UK courts in the Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:103" rel="footnote">[footnote 103]</a></sup> case was not warranted and called for government intervention or clarification with regards to the precedent set. However, one respondent stated that preventing UK courts acting in this manner would damage the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> ecosystem. Some respondents stated that international solutions were needed to address the alleged problems resulting from these decisions. One respondent stated that though the ceasing of national courts determining global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates may result in <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates that vary between jurisdictions this is not necessarily undesirable. This respondent suggested that inconsistencies between <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates in different countries may ultimately result in greater consistency in the overall global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing market.</p>

<h4>Role of courts in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes</h4>

<p>6.10.
Several respondents said it is not efficient for courts to make determinations on whether a licence is <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> on a case-by-case basis. Several respondents also said litigation is time consuming and costly. Some respondents stated that resources required for litigation may create problems for parties with limited resources, such as <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>, or when dealing with large patent portfolios. One respondent commented that the cost of litigation is prohibitive to many companies and evaluation of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates should be available without litigation. Some respondents raised concerns about inconsistency between different national courts or forum shopping. One respondent said there may be significant periods where implementers are unlicensed due to the implementers delaying negotiations and compelling the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder to litigation. The respondent stated this is not efficient for the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder and gives an advantage to the implementer as the licence terms determined by the court are unlikely to fully compensate for the lost revenue during the unlicensed period. However, one respondent said litigation can be efficient if courts recognise that licensing is normally done on a portfolio basis.</p>

<p>6.11.
Some of the respondents that stated resolution via courts is not efficient also said that, despite this, courts are the only or best way of resolving <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licence disputes unless parties agree otherwise. Several respondents also said the right of access to court should be maintained. A number of respondents referred to court decisions being of use due to their transparency. Some of these said court judgements provide guidance on details of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences and/or expectations of behaviour that can help future negotiations. Further, some respondents commented that courts are more transparent than ADR mechanisms. Some respondents said courts were best placed to deal with <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> disputes, referring to courts being bound by precedent, being best equipped to deal with the complexity of these disputes, and having access to evidence. A number of respondents said courts are, or should be, used as a last resort in trying to agree a licence or that most licences are reached through negotiations.</p>

<p>6.12.
Some respondents stated that negotiated outcomes should be incentivised or that courts should not be so relied upon in an efficient <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> environment. However, one respondent said courts are the only way to obtain compensation from a truly unwilling licensee.  Some respondents said that the courts are the only, or most, effective way to resolve disputes in <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing if parties do not agree to ADR. A few respondents said courts should encourage parties to seek a common forum for resolving issues, such as arbitration.</p>

<p>6.13.
Some respondents suggested third party provision of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> templates or information on court decisions would increase efficiency in negotiations. Another respondent suggested courts could be more efficient by deferring to resolutions found by other courts. One respondent said increasing the transparency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing may reduce litigation. Another respondent called for clarification of the role of national courts, including that national courts should not make judgment over foreign <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> or set global licences. This respondent said litigation across multiple national courts would allow a <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holder to demonstrate the strength of its global portfolio and would facilitate global licensing negotiations without involving national courts determining global licence terms.</p>

<h4>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h4>

<p>6.14. 
The call for views asked questions about alternative means of arbitration and dispute resolution away from the courts. In response to these questions a number of respondents made reference to arbitration, mediation and ADR. The summary here uses ADR as a generic term that refers to ways of resolving disputes without the use of litigation in court, and which includes arbitration and mediation. Where specific references have been made to arbitration or mediation this has been reflected in this summary.</p>

<p>6.15. 
A number of respondents stated existing means of ADR can be effective, but their effectiveness is dependent on both parties entering these means voluntarily. A few of these commented that arbitration is usually favoured by licensors, while licensees/implementers often do not agree to arbitration. However, some respondents who commented raised drawbacks of ADR or said ADR mechanisms are not effective. Some responses to this section pointed to the World Intellectual Property Organization (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organization’s">WIPO</abbr>) and the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), amongst others, as providing existing ADR for <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing.</p>

<p>6.16.
A number of respondents said ADR should not be mandatory, with some of these commenting that parties should not be labelled ‘unwilling’ if they do not want to participate in ADR. One respondent stated that potential licensees should not be forced to engage in arbitration to avoid the threat of an injunction. Several respondents also stated that the right of access to court is important and should be maintained.</p>

<p>6.17. 
One respondent said ADR should not be seen as preferable to litigation. Another respondent said <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> arbitration should not be encouraged. This respondent said that allowing for regular litigated or arbitrated outcomes would reduce incentives to contribute to standards development. However, one respondent said ADR mechanisms should be promoted as effective ways to resolve disputes, especially to <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. Another respondent said there is potential for greater voluntary use of ADR.</p>

<p>6.18.
A number of responses also made reference to whether government intervention is needed in ADR. Most of these comments said the government should not intervene in dispute resolution or that solutions should be industry led. Some of these responses said government intervention may lead to forum shopping. Some respondents that stated the government should not intervene in dispute resolution said the government should provide the appropriate framework for <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing to occur or should encourage willing licensees and good faith negotiations to reduce the likelihood of disputes.</p>

<h4>Advantages and disadvantages of existing Alternative Dispute Resolution</h4>

<p>6.19. 
A number of respondents cited various advantages of ADR. These included confidentiality, speed, and lower costs than the courts. Respondents also said they had the advantages of allowing parties to have input into the composition of arbitration panels, and ADR having rules that can be modified to suit specific circumstances/features of a dispute. Some respondents said there were advantages in arbitration not being subject to appeal, and arbitration decisions being enforceable almost worldwide under the New York Convention. Some respondents also commented that international ADR can be used for cross-jurisdictional decisions on international disputes, which would reduce forum shopping.</p>

<p>6.20. 
Many respondents, including some that stated existing ADR means can be effective, reported disadvantages of ADR. The most common disadvantage stated was that, in contrast to litigation, ADR is not transparent. Some respondents stated this results in a lack of precedent and benchmarks for future cases and does not contribute to the broader understanding of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing. One respondent said this may also result in a lack of certainty of outcomes for the parties involved.</p>

<p>6.21. 
Respondents covered a number of other disadvantages. Some said arbitrators may lack the technical expertise required or the jurisdiction to decide certain matters, e.g. patent validity. Some respondents commented that arbitration is not necessarily cheaper or more efficient than litigation. Some stated ADR means also do not provide for discovery of prior licence agreements during disputes, allow public input, or may alter due process rights, e.g. the right to appeal or where burden of proof lies. A few respondents also commented that arbitration impinges on the ability of national jurisdictions to retain authority over the patent rights of their jurisdiction. One respondent said that whilst existing arbitration may be adequate to resolve disputes between individual parties it does not address industry-wide disagreements. Some responses said arbitration may not be suitable for <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> due to the smaller value of the disputes, or <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> being unfamiliar with the process.</p>

<h4>Proposals for Alternative Dispute Resolution</h4>

<p>6.22. 
Some respondents stated that it is not clear that further means of ADR are needed due to those that already exist, but proposed ways to encourage the use of ADR. Two respondents commented that existing arbitration could be improved by having dedicated guidance for <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> disputes. One respondent suggested current ADR means could be incentivised by ensuring no legal remedies are available to the courts that are not also available in ADR. This respondent suggested this could be achieved by preventing granting of injunctions in litigation except in rare circumstances. One respondent said the availability of accelerated <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> proceedings in front of independent, well-regarded courts would encourage quicker, good faith negotiations and would discourage opportunistic behaviour. This respondent also stated ensuring courts are cost and time effective is already a tool for resolving <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing disputes. One respondent stated that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing polices should be issued that provide guidance on how parties should behave in negotiations to reduce <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. This respondent also suggested that the government could impose deadlines for negotiations which if passed parties would need to enter into mediation.</p>

<p>6.23. 
Several respondents suggested changes that could be made to existing ADR mechanisms. These included making arbitration methods and decisions public, making arbitration decisions appealable, and allowing parties to look at previously agreed <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licences during ADR procedures, as occurs in court litigation. Some of these said early disclosure of other licences would help potential licensees check if licence offers are <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>. Some respondents also commented that arbitration should offer appropriate due process rights to parties, and arbitrators should be impartial and have relevant expertise. One respondent also stated ADR mechanisms should not automatically assume <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> essentiality, validity, and infringement when proceeding with <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate determination.</p>

<p>6.24. 
A number of responses included comments relating to the establishment of new ADR mechanisms. Some suggested international solutions were needed to promote consistency or address forum shopping. One of these respondents said such an international forum could be modelled on the copyright tribunals of the US and UK. One respondent suggested the government could moderate an initiative advised by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> experts and industry experts. A few respondents said independent tribunals could be established to deal with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes. One of these suggested a tribunal akin to an employment tribunal could be established that is lower in cost so that it is accessible to implementers.</p>

<p>6.25. 
Some respondents said <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could play a role in ADR. One of these respondents stated that arbitration within <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could help small companies and new entrants in the ICT sector. Some respondents suggested SDO membership could require arbitration or mediation prior to any litigation and for arbitration decisions to be published. One of these respondents stated that dispute resolution could involve a mandatory mediation hearing exploring the likely outcomes if the matter were to go to full trial, as is procedure in the Family Court in divorce proceedings. This respondent also suggested that having an exchange of comparable licence agreements between the lawyers only would maintain desired confidentiality of licences. Another respondent said that any new industry-led approaches need to be more cost-effective and quicker than litigation and arbitration. This respondent also stated any new forums need to provide tools enabling determination of whole <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> portfolios.</p>

    So-called ‘hold-up’ refers to the practice where a SEP holder demands an excessive license fee above a fair and reasonable rate.

    So-called ‘hold-out’ refers to the practice where an implementer delays agreeing a licence in order to escape payment of royalties or to pressure the SEP holder to agree to a lower licence fee than may be fair or reasonable. There is lack of agreement on what behaviour by an implementer constitutes hold-out. See Section 2 on competition and market functioning for more views on hold-out.<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:13" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>

    The value chain refers to the process and entities involved in adding value to a product from start to finish, for example combining raw materials to produce components, or combining components to produce an end product. The supply chain refers to all entities that handle a product up to its distribution to the consumer. Unlike the value chain, members of a supply chain do not necessarily add value, they may include intermediaries who simply transport inputs from one entity to another. Responses contained a mixture of uses of the terms “value chain” and “supply chain” even when arguing to similar conclusions. We have used the term that seemed most appropriate to the points of view we have attempted to summarise.<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:27" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
