<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Our aim is to produce the optimal intellectual property (<abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>) framework for the UK that will promote innovation and creativity both now and, in the future, while supporting the government’s ambitions set out in the Innovation Strategy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> and Diversification Strategy (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-supply-chain-diversification-strategy">Government’s Telecoms Diversification Strategy</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The IPO has been conducting a call for views to investigate whether&nbsp;the ecosystem around Standard Essential Patents <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> is functioning efficiently and effectively and strikes the right balance for all entities involved. The purpose is to help assess whether government intervention is required.</p>

<h2>Section 1 - The balance of the ecosystem and benefits to innovation and consumers</h2>

<p>Many respondents said that a balanced ecosystem was essential to supporting innovation and competition. Respondents also pointed to the benefits of standardisation for innovation and consumers in sectors which require technical interoperability. Some said no change is needed or that there is no evidence of a problem. However, others said that the system is imbalanced, either in favour of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> or implementers. Many respondents said that there were specific challenges which concerned them even if they thought that the system overall worked well.</p>

<p>We received many specific proposals for changes intended to benefit consumers, innovation, and competition in response to our opening questions and throughout. Responses discussed potential roles for Standard Development Organisations (<abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>),<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> commercial entities including patents pools, regulators and the UK Government in contributing to a balanced framework and protecting the interests of consumers.</p>

<h2>Section 2 - Competition and market functioning</h2>

<p>Competition issues competition law and guidance. Some respondents said there were no issues in respect of market power<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> in relation to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. These pointed to the rapid adoption of standardised technology and other indicators in support of this. Others argued that the requirement to offer licences on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>) terms meant that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders could not exercise potential market power derived from the incorporation of their technology in a standard.</p>

<p>However, many respondents said that there exists an imbalance of power to influence prices in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> negotiations. Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders said implementers derive power from the requirement to offer <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms, which gave them the ability to “hold-out”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> or delay entering into licences, while these terms were negotiated and litigated. Most implementers said that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders exercise market power, and some argued that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders used the threat of injunctions to coerce implementers to accept non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences (so called “hold-up”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>). Similarly, there were a mixture of views on whether there were wider issues related to competition and market functioning. Issues discussed included barriers to entry and market exclusion; “tying and bundling”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> of patents; and negative impacts of UK courts determining global licensing terms. Both sides of this debate submitted examples and court case evidence in support of their arguments.</p>

<p>A number of responses did not call for any changes to be made to competition law or guidelines. Some pointed to the benefits of patent pools<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> in addressing issues of pricing. On the other hand, some called for changes to address their concerns. Some called for changes to legislation such as the Patents Act 1977 to restrict the use of injunctions, or for the establishment of a tribunal to determine prices. Some also called for change to the Horizontal Guidelines<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>which cover issues of potential market power in relation to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>, or for investigations by the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Section 3 - Transparency</h2>

<p><strong>Transparency of essentiality, and over-declaration</strong>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> Respondents discussed the challenges for licensees of determining which patents were truly essential to the standard. Many respondents put the issue of transparency of essentiality of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> in the context of the policies of <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>. Some <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (<abbr title="European Telecommunications Standards Institute">ETSI</abbr>) which produces telecommunications standards, require disclosure of patents which merely have the potential to be essential to a standard. This is so that they can be the subject of a commitment to offer <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms before being incorporated into the standard. Some said this would naturally lead to so called “over-declaration” but that this was not genuinely problematic. Others said that over-declaration created serious problems. These included uncertainty, costs and inefficiencies for firms seeking to negotiate licences or involved in litigation, and asymmetry of information between negotiating parties and effects on prices.</p>

<p><strong>Essentiality checking.</strong> Some saw no need for an independent third-party essentiality checking service, because there was not a problem or because the parties involved in the negotiations were better placed to carry out the checks. Others stated that any such checks must be voluntary or that there must be recourse to the courts for essentiality checking. Others pointed to the existing essentiality checking services provided by patent pools in some sectors. However, some argued there was a need to introduce independent third-party checks and saw a role for governments, regulators and patent offices in prescribing how these should be carried out. Some thought patent offices could carry out such checks themselves. A number of respondents commented on the appropriate methodology for essentiality checks and the use of databases.</p>

<p><strong>Legal certainty.</strong> We asked whether greater legal certainty could be provided for essentiality checks and, if so, how. Many respondents, both <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers, said that a legally binding decision on essentiality and non-essentiality could only be made by the courts. Some respondents said it would be impractical to determine essentiality with legal certainty for more than a small number of patents or that this would require successful assertion of each and every <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> in a portfolio.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency of pricing.</strong>  We asked about whether there was sufficient transparency of licensing rates when entering into a negotiation, and whether some pricing transparency would be appropriate. Some argued there was sufficient transparency of pricing in markets for the most standardised technologies, for example cellular technology. Some also said that pricing transparency was difficult for markets in new technology, but that pricing becomes transparent as markets evolve. Some also gave the example of the transparency of pricing provided by public disclosures of prices by some patent pools.</p>

<p>However, several respondents did not think there was sufficient transparency. They raised specific concerns about the use of non-disclosure agreements in licensing terms. Some said this limited the availability of information about terms, made negotiation more difficult and created scepticism about whether licensees were being offered the best rate. We received a number of proposals to improve price transparency including to remove such restrictions in licensing agreements. Some respondents said that truly comparable licences should be made available during negotiations. Other examples included requirements for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to publicly disclose rates, or to disclose rates to a suitable body such as the relevant SDO, the IPO, a competition authority, or a tribunal similar to the Copyright Tribunal.</p>

<p><strong>Charging different <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rates to different licensees.</strong> We also asked whether there is a justification under <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> to charge implementers different rates when using the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> for the same purpose. Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders said that different approaches or methodologies might be used by different <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> owners to negotiate royalty terms, and all may be consistent with the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> concept because they reflect the market-based value of the licensed <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> or differences in the value created by different uses of the technology (e.g. in cars compared to domestic appliances). Some responded that the Supreme Court in their judgement in Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>rejected the argument that differences in pricing terms for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> is presumptively problematic and that the non-discrimination element of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> does not mean that every licensee is entitled to the same rate, even similarly situated licensees.</p>

<p>However, several respondents said that that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders bound by the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment have no justification to charge similarly situated users differently. Some respondents, mainly implementers, also added that they disagreed with arguments which said that differences in price were justified on differences in the value of end-product technology. These issues are further summarised below.</p>

<h2>Section 4 – Patent infringement and remedies</h2>

<p><strong>Levels of litigation.</strong> Some respondents said the current UK patent system and approach to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing generally works well. However, others said there were relatively high levels of litigation, and both <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers said that this created problems for them in terms of costs or finance. Views on the nature and causes of these problems differed and reflected the differing views on issues such as “hold-up” and “hold-out”, and transparency more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Global fairness and the decisions of national courts.</strong> Respondents were asked whether the current patent regime creates a fair global market. While there were some comments on the fairness or otherwise of the overall system, many respondents highlighted specific respects in which they said it was not fair. These included variation in the approaches of courts to injunction or damages, including protectionism, variations in the costs of enforcement, and unfair practices by <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or implementers. Many responses said that the UK Courts were a favoured destination for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or perceived to be friendly to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders. Many responses discussed the UK court’s determination of the terms of global licences in the case of Unwired Planet<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>, with differing views on whether that has contributed to unfairness, as discussed below.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement.</strong> Respondents were also asked about the sufficiency of the framework for enforcement of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> and the impact of the use of injunctions and anti-suit injunctions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> (ASIs). Some respondents said enforcement was costly and slow, or difficult. Most <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders said that injunctions should be available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> cases as for other patents, and that case law already provided a framework for their appropriate use in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> cases. Most implementers said injunctions should not be available or should only be available in rare circumstances. They argued the threat of an injunction can be used to pressure a licensee into accepting non-<abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms, and that in making a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment the patent holder had foregone any right to exclude others from the technology incorporated into the standard.</p>

<p>Some of those who said the current system left incentives for hold-out suggested that enhanced damages could be awarded instead of or in addition to injunctions. Some of those who said that injunctions should be used only in rare circumstances said that policy statements or changes to the Patents Act 1977 were needed.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-suit injunctions.</strong> Many respondents commented on the use of ASIs, which prevent a party from commencing or continuing the same legal action in another or foreign jurisdiction or enforcing a judgment obtained in foreign legal proceedings.  Some argued that ASIs could be useful in avoiding duplication of disputes and conflicting decisions in different jurisdictions. Some also argued that they must be available to implementers to prevent <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders choosing to pursue legal action in the most favourable jurisdiction to them. However, several respondents said that ASIs were problematic, adding to the cost, complexity and length of litigation or depriving <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders of their ability to enforce their patents. Some respondents said that ASIs had been used in the Chinese courts without due process. Respondents also said ASIs had been used to assert jurisdiction as a response to the determination of global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing terms in the case of Unwired Planet v Huawei.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<p>We received several proposals for discouraging the use of ASIs. One proposal was that the use of an ASI should be treated by the courts as a sign of being an unwilling licensee. Others said that the issue could not be solved at a national level and that their needed to be a convergence between jurisdictions as to when injunctions should be available in <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> disputes, or a single international forum for arbitrating disputes related to global licences.</p>

<h2>Section 5 – Licensing of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>
</h2>

<p><strong>Emerging technologies.</strong> We asked how the framework for <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> ecosystem might adapt for emerging technologies. Some respondents, including most <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders argued that the system generally worked well to encourage innovation, and that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> licensing was an enabler of technology take up. Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders, licensing administrators and others said that patent pools could offer a means for implementers in new markets to implement standardised technologies. Others, including many implementers, responded that concerns they had about the ecosystem generally applied, or especially applied, to emerging technologies. Some responses discussed specific concerns around impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) and UK small-to-medium enterprises (<abbr title="Small-to-medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr>). Concerns included the impact of court decisions seen as favourable to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders; cost, uncertainty and complexity, transparency, lack of information and understanding; and bad faith in negotiations. Responses also discussed the basis of licensing rates and who should be able to obtain a licence, which are discussed more generally below.</p>

<p>A number of respondents said that SDO should update their policies to accommodate emerging technologies and submitted specific proposals for change. Some respondents said there was no need for further government regulation in this area. Others said the UK should change the law or provide guidance.</p>

<p><strong>Flexibilities to improve efficiency for implementers.</strong> We asked whether flexibilities existed which could improve the efficiency of obtaining a licence. Some respondents said <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> arrangements provided sufficient flexibility and that court decisions, such as Huawei v ZTE<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> and Unwired Planet provided a balance for both parties in negotiations, and guidance to settle disputes on a case-by-case basis. Some respondents also responded to say that the practice of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders choosing to licence at a specific level of the value chain,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup> such as to end product manufacturers was efficient, and did not prevent access to technologies for those at other points on the value chain (such as component manufacturers).</p>

<p>However, many implementers and some others, argued that there were a number of sources of inefficiency for implementers. Difficulties stated included the preference of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders to provide licences at a specific, downstream, level of the value chain; the use of injunctions; transparency and disclosure; bad faith in negotiations; and broader challenges of obtaining a <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate. Some respondents proposed changes to the law to address the difficulties they said implementers faced. These included changes to UK law to restrict the use of injunctions or the introduction of principles to provide guidance on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> negotiations. Some respondents said the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> should amplify the guidance which already exists in the Horizontal Guidelines to address the issue of the point in the value chain at which a licence is offered. Some respondents also suggest sources of potential improvements besides changes to the <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> framework, such as greater provision or use of patent pools.</p>

<p><strong>Other means of improving efficiency.</strong> Responses to a follow up question on other means of efficiency around <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing generally said improvements could be made. Examples of proposals which have not been summarised elsewhere included more specific proposals aimed at providing greater transparency of licences (such as requirements to disclose and publish licensing rates); and proposals to incentivise good faith negotiations by requiring a punitive element for bad faith behaviour by licensors or licensees. Some said SME implementers could benefit from better awareness or understanding of licensing practices in response to this question. Some pointed to existing guidance which could be used. Some suggested guidance on negotiations and the information which should be provided would help improve efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Patent Pools.</strong> Many respondents said that patent pools can improve the efficiency of <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing, for example by providing transparency of pricing, and reducing costs and delays. However, some said that it could take years to establish a patent pool at critical mass and that they were more effective in some technology sectors than others. Some respondents said they saw some problems associated with patent pools (even if they also saw benefits). Some respondents said that having more than one patent pool for a standard made negotiating a licence more complex. Some respondents said that patent pools could raise costs for smaller <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders or licences. Some respondents had concerns about the transparency of ownership of patent pools and wanted more transparency about the licensing terms offered within them. They had similar concerns to those which have been raised in relation to bilateral negotiations, for example, about the willingness of implementers to enter into licences, or the point in the value chain at which licences are offered, were said to be concerns in the context of patent pools too.</p>

<p>No respondents said that patent pools should be mandated, and many said that to do so would be problematic. Some respondents said that the establishment of patent pools was best left to licensing administrators. However, some respondents said States or <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr> could have a partial role, such as encouraging or facilitating their establishment or providing guidance on their structure or terms.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing.</strong> We asked about the best way to resolve disputes around pricing and for views on related issues. Some respondents said that settlement of disputes over pricing was best left to the courts. Some said they favoured the practice by some courts of using comparable licences in settling disputes about an appropriate <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> rate. We also received many responses on the issue of point in the value chain at which licences should be offered (e.g., to a component manufacturer or to an end product manufacturer) and the distinct but related issue of the basis for setting royalties (e.g. in relation to a component or an end product).</p>

<p>Several respondents said that the <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> commitment should be interpreted to mean that standardised technology should be accessible to all, rather than licensed to all. Respondents submitted views on practical challenges and complexities of negotiating and enforcing licences if they were required to license to all and associated transactions. Licensing to a single point on the value chain was more efficient. Some further argued that the end product manufacturer was the most efficient point at which to provide a licence. Some said that component manufacturers are sufficiently protected by licensing terms which grant rights not just to make but to “have made” the technology covered by the patent.</p>

<p>However, several others said that licences should be available throughout the value chain to any company that wishes to take a licence. Some said refusal to supply licences to downstream component manufacturers would impact on innovation. For example, one respondent said it could harm the ability of component manufacturers to innovate on top of the standard. Other respondents argued that while component suppliers are unable to obtain licences to indemnify their customers for patent infringement, companies seeking to develop innovative products based on components face uncertainty regarding their exposure to infringement claims. Some argued that widening <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> licensing to component manufacturers would encourage new entrants and support competition.</p>

<p>On the related issue of the product in relation to which royalties are calculated, some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and others argued that royalties based on the end product were appropriate, either because this was most practical or because it better captured the value of the contribution of the standardised technology to the consumers. On the other hand, some implementers and others argued that the economic basis for calculating rates payable should be the selling price of the smallest saleable component of a product that implements the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> (such as a microchip). They argued that this ensures royalties reflect the value added by the <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr>, and not the value of any further end product innovation by the implementer.</p>

<p>We asked about the utility of schemes which define allowable costs to be used in the calculation of royalties. Several respondents said that methodological approaches already recognised by the courts should be used. Many respondents, both <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers, responded against introducing more formalised pricing methodologies or rules, as this would be overly inflexible or “one size fits all”.</p>

<p>Respondents discussed the merits of different pricing methodologies. Some advocated use of a fixed royalty per unit. Others advocated schemes which calculate royalties as a percentage of allowable costs, for example in relation to the features which derive value from the patented technology. Some respondents saw a role for a board or expert groups in making assessments of costs or value relevant to setting royalties. Some respondents said that how proposed royalties are calculated should be made more transparent to licensees.</p>

<h2>Section 6 -<abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> Litigation</h2>

<p><strong>Global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms.</strong> We asked about the benefits or otherwise of national courts determining the terms of global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences, as seen in the Unwired Planet case,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> which was the subject of a UK Supreme Court decision on appeal. Several respondents stated that the setting of global licensing rates can be more efficient than pursuing litigation in multiple jurisdictions. Some responded that global licensing decisions by the courts were reflecting industry practice of using global licences, and several <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders generally supported the approach of the UK courts. Some said that in the Unwired Planet decision the court was not forcing a potential licensee to accept a global licence. Rather they had the option to accept a UK limited injunction instead.</p>

<p>However, several respondents, including many implementers, said national courts should not be able to compel a party to accept a determination of global licensing terms. Many respondents saw this as extra-territorial judicial over-reach and said the effect was to encourage forum shopping and the use of ASIs. Some said global <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> determinations heightened concerns about the threat of injunctions being used to compel a potential licensee into accepting terms which are not <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>, and undermined the ability of potential licensees to challenge patents in different jurisdictions. Some said decisions made by the UK courts could discourage innovators away from the UK market, or threaten innovation by UK businesses, including <abbr title="Small-to-medium enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. Some of those who said the decision was problematic called for government intervention or clarification regarding the precedent set. Others said that international solutions were needed.</p>

<p><strong>Role of courts and <abbr title="Alternative dispute resolution">ADR</abbr>.</strong> We asked about the efficiency of case-by-case determination of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licensing terms, and about alternative dispute resolution (<abbr title="Alternative dispute resolution">ADR</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> mechanisms, such as mediation or arbitration. Many responses said court cases were not an efficient means of making determinations, and that litigation was costly and time consuming. Despite this, many of those respondents and others said that the courts are the only or best way of making determinations where negotiating parties can’t agree. The transparency of details of <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> licences and guidance on expectations of behaviour provided by the courts were benefits highlighted by many. Nonetheless some said that negotiated solutions or use of other forms of dispute resolution should be encouraged.</p>

<p>Many respondents said that existing means of <abbr title="Alternative dispute resolution">ADR</abbr> can be effective, although both parties have to agree to enter into this voluntarily. Advantages stated included lower cost, speed, confidentiality, flexibility, the absence of appeal, and the potential to be use for cross jurisdictional disputes. Disadvantages stated included that there was a lack of transparency and ability to provide precedents that arbitration was not always lower cost than litigation, the absence of provision for disclosure of prior licences, and a lack of technical expertise or jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Most respondents who commented said that <abbr title="Alternative dispute resolution">ADR</abbr> should not be mandatory, and some proposed incentivising voluntary use of existing <abbr title="Alternative dispute resolution">ADR</abbr> mechanisms. Others proposed changes to address what they saw as the disadvantages of existing mechanisms. On the other hand, some respondents proposed that requirements to enter into <abbr title="Alternative dispute resolution">ADR</abbr> could be mandated by <abbr title="Standard Development Organisations">SDOs</abbr>. Some respondents said there was a need for new forums for arbitration. A few respondents proposed there should be a new forum at an international level, which could be modelled e.g., on the UK Copyright Tribunal.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>The IPO would like to thank all contributors to the call for views on Standard Essential Patents and Innovation. The responses provided valuable information and frequently pointed to relevant evidence and data to consider.</p>

<p>Many respondents stated the importance of standards and <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> for innovation and consumers. We found that both <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers reported problems related to the efficiency or effectiveness of the ecosystem around <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr>. However, there was little consensus on the nature, extent, causes, and impact of problems in this area, with <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and implementers often advancing opposing arguments in response to the questions posed.</p>

<p>There was also little consensus on the need for government to intervene. Some <abbr title="Standard Essential Patent">SEP</abbr> holders and others argued for no change or minimal changes. Some respondents pointed to the potential of market led solutions such as patent pools. However, some implementers and others called for government intervention, through changing legislation, issuing guidance, or establishing or strengthening institutions or processes. Some of these proposals were intended to counter the effect of decisions which had been subject to careful reasoning in the UK courts, including the Supreme Court. And a number of respondents called for changes at an international level which might require co-ordination or collaboration between States.</p>

<p>The IPO believes that standards and standard essential patents will be of growing importance to the UK economy, and the government’s ambition for the UK to be a science and technology superpower and innovation hub by 2035. Given the breadth of issues raised and the divergence of the views on the case for government intervention, the IPO will require a further period while we assess the issues and, as appropriate, consider the merits of the proposals submitted. During this period, we will engage with businesses and others to ensure we have understood their concerns and seek further evidence where needed. We will report our findings to UK ministers in 2023 and would expect any significant policy interventions to be subject to consultation.</p>

<p>We will continue to work closely with other UK public authorities and government departments. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will contribute to this ongoing work to drive forward its ambitions set out in the 5G supply chain diversification strategy.&nbsp;Ministry of Justice will contribute to consideration of issues concerning dispute resolution and access to justice. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> envisages preparing and consulting on draft guidance on horizontal agreements later in 2022, including on standardisation agreements. Responses to this IPO call for views on <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> will inform any content in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s draft guidance that might relate to <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr>.</p>

<p>We will also continue to engage at an international level with other patent offices and others, recognising that <abbr title="Standard Essential Patents">SEPs</abbr> are used by global businesses and technologies, and some of the responses we received call for global collaboration to be considered.</p>

      <p>In the <abbr title="European Telecommunications Standards Institute">ETSI</abbr> IPR Policy, “declaration” refers to a commitment by a patent owner that ensures their patent is available for implementation of a standard. For example, a declarant making a commitment that their patent is licenced on <abbr title="Fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory">FRAND</abbr> terms. A disclosure informs an SDO of specific patent(s) that the patent holder believes may or may become essential to a standard. Responses contained a mixture of the uses of the terms “declaration” and “disclosure”. However, it was not clear to us those responses always observed this distinction when using these terms.
