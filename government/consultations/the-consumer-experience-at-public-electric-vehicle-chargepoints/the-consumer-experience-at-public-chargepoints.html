<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>The transition to zero-emission vehicles is central to meeting our ambitious climate commitments. We’re already making fantastic progress. In 2020, electric vehicles (<abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>) accounted for 1 in 10 new cars sold, up from 1 in 30 in 2019. Overall demand for fully electric vehicles grew by 186%.</p>

<p>As the first major global economy to pass a law that requires us to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the UK is on track to end its contribution to climate change. We’re committed to making lasting changes in the way we travel and to building back greener for the benefit of everyone.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-takes-historic-step-towards-net-zero-with-end-of-sale-of-new-petrol-and-diesel-cars-by-2030">November 2020, we committed to ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030</a>, with all vehicles required to have a significant zero-emissions capability (for example, plug-in and full hybrids) from 2030 and to be 100% zero emissions from 2035. We have committed to a world-leading £2.5 billion package to support consumers to make this transition.</p>

<p>Reliable and easily accessible charging infrastructure is key to making the switch to <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> as easy and smooth as possible. This is a fast-moving sector that has already seen tremendous growth of innovative technological solutions for drivers, such as using lampposts as a low-cost charging solution for those without off-street parking. 2020 saw more ultra-rapid chargepoints deployed than any year before. These can deliver up to 145 miles of range in just 15 minutes for a typical <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, it’s essential that <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers feel confident using the public chargepoint network. In this consultation, we set out proposals that mean current and future <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers will be able to locate available chargepoints simply, pay for a charge more easily and recharge their cars more reliably, regardless of where they are going in the UK. Drivers need to know they can rely on the public charging network for any journey they take. This will reduce range anxiety and position the UK as a world leader in deploying advanced <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging infrastructure.</p>

<p>These proposals will ensure the growth of <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> can take place at the pace required to hit our bold climate targets. To that end, the measures in this consultation represent significant progress towards our end goal: to ensure that drivers of electric vehicles have a refuelling experience equal to or even better than petrol or diesel vehicle drivers.</p>

<p>Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP</p>

<p>Secretary for State for Transport</p>

<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>In 2019, the government committed the UK to meet net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, to ensure the UK ends its contribution to climate change. Transport is now the largest sector for UK greenhouse gas emissions. Cars and vans alone represent 19% of all domestic emissions. The transition to zero-emission vehicles is therefore vital to realising our net-zero ambitions.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the government is taking decisive action to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans, with all vehicles required to have a significant zero-emissions capability (for example, plug-in and full hybrids) from 2030 and to be 100% zero emissions from 2035.</p>

<p>There are now over 300,000 ultra-low emission vehicles registered in the UK and over 20,000 public chargepoints installed for <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>. The government has committed £2.8 billion to support this transition.</p>

<p><abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint installation and operation is a relatively new and growing market. We want to encourage and leverage private sector investment to build and operate a self-sustaining public chargepoint network that’s affordable, reliable and accessible for all consumers.</p>

<p>As charging technology and infrastructure evolves and expands, new consumer offers will continue to emerge. We want to enable innovative charging approaches while ensuring that all consumers can charge their vehicle in a way that is as straightforward and reliable as refuelling a traditional vehicle. This is essential, not only for existing <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers but for giving people who are more reluctant to switch the confidence to do so.</p>

<p>This consultation sets our expectations and ambitions across 4 critical areas.</p>

<h3>Making it easy to pay</h3>

<p>Consumers should be able to charge their vehicle and pay with ease, as they would for any other service. There should be a minimum standard for payment across all chargepoints, which does not rely on the use of a smartphone. We seek views on the best way to achieve this that meets consumers’ needs and is commercially viable.</p>

<p>Consumers should be able to rely on their chosen payment method, whether they’re making a short or long journey. Implementing roaming across networks means consumers can access all public chargepoints with one membership card or smartphone app. As smartphone technologies advance, we want to see convergence towards fewer apps that can access thousands of chargepoints across the UK.</p>

<h3>Opening up chargepoint data</h3>

<p>All drivers should be able to locate available chargepoints easily when they need to charge their vehicle.</p>

<p>Opening up chargepoint data will enable the development of consumer-friendly apps and improve consumer experience.</p>

<p>It will also reduce costs by encouraging competition and innovation, and support system planning across the transport and electricity sectors.</p>

<h3>Using a single payment metric</h3>

<p>Consumers should be able to understand and compare pricing offers across the UK network to select the best available price, as is currently the case for petrol and diesel vehicles.</p>

<p>Standardisation to a pence-per-kilowatt hour (kWh) basis will enable a simpler pricing framework for all users. Providers would still be able to offer a range of bundled services tariffs.</p>

<p>This approach ensures alignment with the energy sector and the price of electricity used across the network, helping consumers compare how much they are paying at home with how much they are paying when they use the public charging network.</p>

<h3>Ensuring a reliable charging network</h3>

<p>Reliable infrastructure is critical to mass-market roll-out.</p>

<p>It’s essential that the public chargepoint network is maintained and that faults are repaired quickly to ensure a minimum 99% reliability across the charging infrastructure. A 24/7 helpline is required for those who need assistance when struggling to use a chargepoint.</p>

<h3>Emerging policy areas</h3>

<p>In addition to the 4 areas above, we’re seeking evidence on 3 emerging policy areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accessibility for disabled consumers</li>
  <li>weatherproofing and lighting</li>
  <li>signage</li>
</ul>

<p>We want to understand the issues facing consumers in these areas and whether there are priority areas to address. This will enable us to get an idea where there may be a need for government intervention in the immediate future and which agency is best placed to intervene.</p>

<p>We’ll be holding workshops to engage with industry and consumer groups to evolve the policy options for each of the 4 areas above to reduce the burden and costs while best meeting consumer needs. Parliamentary time allowing, we expect to bring in the necessary regulation following this consultation in autumn 2021.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Aims and scope of the consultation</h3>

<p>In 2019, the UK made history by becoming the first major global economy to pass legislation to end our contribution to climate change. Delivering net-zero emissions will require a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy including transport.</p>

<p>Cars and vans represent 19% of all domestic emissions. We’ll only achieve our net-zero commitment if we can transition this fleet to zero-emission vehicles.</p>

<p>In November 2020, the Prime Minister announced the commitment to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans, with all new cars and vans required to have a significant zero-emissions capability (for example, plug-in and full hybrids) from 2030 and be 100% zero emissions from 2035.</p>

<p>To support the transition to <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>, the government has committed £2.8 billion, with grants available for plug-in cars, vans, lorries, buses, taxis and motorcycles, as well as funding to support chargepoint infrastructure at homes and workplaces, on residential streets, and across the wider roads network.</p>

<p>We’re increasing the provision of chargepoints along the strategic road network through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-vision-for-the-rapid-chargepoint-network-in-england/government-vision-for-the-rapid-chargepoint-network-in-england">Rapid Charging Fund</a>.</p>

<p>We know high consumer confidence in charging infrastructure is crucial to securing the market transition at pace and ensuring a modern, innovative market that attracts investment. We’re building on the positive steps from industry to encourage the uptake of <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> through a better consumer experience at the public network.</p>

<p>This consultation reflects our ambitions for the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> sector to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>build confidence in the market</li>
  <li>build up the demand for <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>open opportunities for innovation and market investment</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an important stage of <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> roll-out across the country. The <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> driver of today is not the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> driver of tomorrow, with the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> market still in the early adopter phase. As we transition to mass-market roll-out, consumer needs and priorities will need to change to reflect the wider changing driver make-up.</p>

<p>We need to ensure this emerging market can continue to innovate and grow while providing an excellent consumer experience. Therefore, any new regulation must be proportionate and appropriate. This consultation sets out our baseline expectations to improve consumer experience when using the charging network. We’re proposing interventions in 4 areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quick payment process</li>
  <li>network reliability</li>
  <li>pricing transparency</li>
  <li>open data</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re also seeking evidence in areas where we think there may be a case for the government to intervene, but further evidence is required, such as accessibility.</p>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>) is conducting a forward-looking market study to help develop competition as the sector grows. This study is also looking at consumer interaction, including building consumer trust, pricing and access to a reliable charging infrastructure. We’ll be working alongside the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to ensure alignment in considering these and related issues.</p>

<p>This consultation covers all publicly available chargepoints in the UK, including those in the devolved nations. We’re considering these proposals alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/electric-vehicle-smart-charging">potential requirements for smart charging</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>The charging experience and our vision</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint market has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. In this short time, we’ve seen considerable market development and growing breadth of consumer offers such as payment apps covering multiple chargepoint networks and private bodies providing availability data; however, consumers too often report frustrations over unnecessary complexity when using public charging infrastructure. This is detrimental not just to the charging experience but to encouraging faster take-up of <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> by other consumers.</p>

<p>We’re consulting on measures to improve various stages of the consumer experience at public chargepoints, including:</p>

<h4>Locating chargepoints</h4>

<p>Consumers should be able to access a range of software solutions providing them with comprehensive and accurate chargepoint data that enables them to locate and access chargepoints with ease. Currently, chargepoint operators (<abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>) only display static information such as location and power rating related to their network on their apps.</p>

<p>More comprehensive private-sector led solutions are emerging such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zap-map.com/" rel="external">Zap-Map’s</a> platform and its provision of location and ‘live’ availability chargepoint data; however, this data is not openly available, and lack of mandated data provision standards means that chargepoint data can be incomprehensive and inaccurate, leading to a poor consumer experience.</p>

<h4>Comparing costs of charging</h4>

<p>We want consumers to be able to easily compare the cost of charging between different networks, helping drive competition and bring down prices. Evidence suggests that consumers are confused by a lack of comparability of pricing information at either public chargepoints or through other means (for example, smartphone apps).</p>

<p>The cost of electricity drawn from public chargepoints is priced using a range of different metrics. A lack of a standard pricing metric prevents consumers from easily comparing prices.</p>

<h4>Charging the vehicle</h4>

<p>Public chargepoint reliability is improving. Analysis<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> shows that in August 2019 around 8% of public chargepoints were out of service, a decrease from 15% in 2017; however, further improvements are required to drive consumer confidence.</p>

<p>Chargepoints being out of order undermines consumer confidence in the public chargepoint network and can put people’s safety at risk if they are left stranded and unable to charge their vehicle.</p>

<h4>Paying for the charge</h4>

<p>Paying for charge should be a smooth, hassle-free process for the consumer, regardless of who operates the individual chargepoint. Simple payment solutions have emerged.</p>

<p>But there remains no common method of access across chargepoint networks and consumers can sometimes need a different smartphone app or membership card for each network. This results in a more complicated experience than that enjoyed by petrol or diesel vehicle drivers and those on the continent, where roaming solutions exist.</p>

<h3>Legislative framework</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/18/contents/enacted" rel="external">Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 (<abbr title="Electric Vehicles Act">AEVA</abbr>)</a> enables the government to introduce regulations to improve the consumer charging experience and increase the provision of public chargepoints. This includes being able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>require a common payment method at all public chargepoints</li>
  <li>introduce requirements on <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to make available static and dynamic information on public chargepoints, and prescribe when, how, to whom and in what format the information is made available</li>
  <li>introduce availability and performance standards for public chargepoints</li>
  <li>introduce connector standards to ensure physical interoperability between <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> and public chargepoints</li>
</ul>

<p>The government also has powers under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/24" rel="external">Pricing Act 1974</a> to introduce a common pricing metric for the supply and sale of electricity to consumers.</p>

<h3>Timings and implementation</h3>

<p>The consultation period began on 13 February 2021 and will run until 10 April 2021, and we welcome feedback through the consultation period. We’ll then review the responses before responding formally.</p>

<p>We’ll work with stakeholders alongside this consultation to test and refine our proposals. We’ll also produce an impact assessment informed by the consultation responses before introducing any regulations. Any regulations will be introduced as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows.</p>

<h2>Policy proposals</h2>

<h3>Payment methods</h3>

<p>Consumers should be able to pay instantly for using public chargepoints in a smooth and hassle-free manner.</p>

<p>At present, consumers need to have multiple membership cards or smartphone apps to access the public charging network. Currently, only 41% of rapid and higher-powered chargepoints (50 kW+) have contactless debit or credit card payment as an option.</p>

<p>Consumers should have a comparably simple payment experience at all chargepoints. Consumers should be able to have a payment option that enables them to pay without the use of a smartphone. We seek views on the best way to achieve this that meets consumer needs and is commercially viable.</p>

<p>Fleet drivers need a simple payment solution that operates across the chargepoint network and allows them to manage their business effectively. We ask how best to deliver a roaming solution to achieve this.</p>

<p>We prpose the requirements would apply from the point of regulations coming into force for new chargepoints. There would be a 12-month period to retrofit existing chargepoints.</p>

<h4>Current state of the market and the problem to be addressed</h4>

<p>Historically, there have been numerous methods of payment for using public chargepoints for <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> including membership cards, SMS text and online web platforms. The most common method is by membership card (known as a radio-frequency identification or <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> card). If customers want to use different chargepoint networks then they require multiple cards.</p>

<p>Many <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> established subscription-based membership models where an <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> card is issued once a consumer has signed up to be a member of their network. Memberships create a sustainable income stream for <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> that enable them to attract private investment.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/897/contents/made" rel="external">Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations 2017 (<abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>)</a> helped to improve ease of payment by requiring chargepoint operators to provide impromptu access <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> at all public chargepoints by November 2018.</p>

<p>Under <abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>, chargepoint operators can prescribe their own method for accessing its services and set different pricing for members and non-members. Most chargepoint operators provide impromptu access through a smartphone app, contactless card payment, or a QR code provided at the chargepoint, which then directs consumers to a payment platform.</p>

<p>Drivers need to be able to pay quickly and easily for charging when making longer journeys. Consumers have reported frustrations with the number of apps and cards needed. They’re less likely to be aware in advance of which charging apps may be needed for their journey than on short-distance journeys or when charging near their work/home.</p>

<p>To remedy this, in July 2019, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that government wanted to see all newly installed rapid and higher-powered chargepoints provide debit or credit card payment by spring 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Several <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> have responded, and 41% of existing 3,500 rapid devices now have contactless card payment compared with 28% in 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. We’d expect to have seen more progress on new rapid devices, but this has not been the case.</p>

<p>Access to public chargepoints should also be achieved by a payment roaming solution, meaning that drivers can access any public chargepoint using one membership card or smartphone app. A roaming approach requires <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to cooperate and third parties to enable members of other networks to access their network.</p>

<p>In July 2019, the Secretary of State for Transport<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> signalled that government expects industry to develop a payment roaming solution across the charging network. The lack of payment interoperability is a regular theme raised by consumer bodies and fleet operators.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lowcvp.org.uk/projects/electric-vehicle-energy-taskforce.htm" rel="external"><abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Energy Taskforce</a>, which brought together over 300 stakeholders, has recommended that a roaming solution should be in place by the end of 2021 and adopted by all <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> at all chargepoints. Some progress has been made in the past 12 months, with peer-to-peer roaming agreements established between some <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and third-party aggregators.</p>

<h4>Emerging technologies</h4>

<p>This is a rapidly evolving market, with new technologies and business models emerging. We need to ensure that any solutions address the needs of current consumers, but we recognise maintaining flexibility is important to encourage innovation.</p>

<p>For example, plug and charge<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> technology would allow consumers to simply plug their car into a chargepoint and charge without the need for a membership card, smartphone app, or debit or credit card.</p>

<p>Instead, the car and the chargepoint would communicate to identify the consumer and their charging contract. Some original equipment manufacturers (<abbr title="Original equipment manufacturers">OEMs</abbr>) are testing this experimental technology, which could see charging speeds, times and cost limit preferences set from within the vehicle.</p>

<p>This would enable service bundles in which charging fees and ongoing vehicle loan finance are grouped into one payment plan.</p>

<h4>Minimum payment requirements for the consumer</h4>

<p>We’re encouraged by the innovation in the application of payment methods in the chargepoint sector, but further improvements are needed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/897/contents/made" rel="external">The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations 2017 (<abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>)</a> requires chargepoint operators to provide impromptu access at all public chargepoints, avoiding the need for membership.</p>

<p>Chargepoint operators can choose their preferred option for meeting this requirement and set differential pricing structures between members and non-members. Most chargepoint operators provide impromptu access through a smartphone app, contactless card payment, or a QR code provided at the chargepoint that then directs consumers to a payment platform.</p>

<p>In practice, impromptu payment often requires access to a smartphone or an online platform. We want to see more progress for supporting payments without reliance on a smartphone.</p>

<h4>Minimum payment outcomes we want to see</h4>

<p>Consumers arriving at a chargepoint should be able to start it and begin charging quickly. The payment process and the cost-per-charge should be easy to understand and to access with clear instructions given at the chargepoint.</p>

<p>Consumers should be able to easily understand and compare payment methods. All acceptable payment types should be displayed equally prominently on the chargepoint.</p>

<p>The minimum payment method should not require a mobile or fixed internet connection and should work at the location of the individual chargepoint – including where this is underground or where there’s no mobile signal.</p>

<p>If a chargepoint operator chooses to offer an impromptu solution requiring the consumer to connect to the internet via their phone, the chargepoint operator must also offer an alternative improvised option.</p>

<p>This could be in the form of contactless payment, for example, or a call or text-based solution. The minimum payment methods will exclude payment methods that require the use of a downloadable app, proprietary software or proprietary card before or after the transaction takes place. Options may include a form of contactless payment, for example, or, potentially, a call or text-based solution.</p>

<p>The impromptu solution should be available to all consumers, regardless of how long they are charging for, or how frequently they use a particular chargepoint or network. The definition of charge includes any amount of charge, with no time limit.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q1</strong>:  Are you in agreement that the payments specified should be allowed as an acceptable payment options? If you don’t agree, please set out why.</p>

<p><strong>Q2</strong>: If implemented, do you think these requirements should apply to all chargepoints? If not, which chargepoints should be covered and why?</p>

<p><strong>Q3</strong>:  What alternative solutions to contactless would provide consumers with a comparable quick and simple payment mechanism (provide evidence on costs)?</p>
</div>

<h4>Payment approaches for fleets</h4>

<p>Companies with fleets need access to a simple payment method that allows the company to monitor and manage payments centrally rather than relying solely on the individual driver. Typically, this has been managed through fuel cards. These enable fleet drivers to refuel their vehicle using any fuel station contracted with the refuelling card.</p>

<p>Leading fuel card suppliers issue <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> cards to individual drivers or cars, which they use to pay for the fuel they consume, and then aggregate, payment and utilisation data for the respective fleet. Fuel card companies are looking to replicate the service they provide for <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> fleets, and some have launched a recharging card; however, to date, only a small number of <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> are participating in charging cards for fleets.</p>

<p>The emergence of electric fleets is also key to growing the second-hand <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> market.</p>

<h3>Case study – Mitie</h3>

<p>Mitie operates a large commercial vehicle (van) and job-car fleet of approximately 5,500 vehicles. It transitioned this fleet to fully electric with 790 pure <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> already on the road (as of October 2020). With diesel vehicles, all drivers are provided with fuel cards to purchase fuel for their vehicles for business use, with the cost of the fuel paid directly by Mitie. On-street and communal parking charging infrastructure is critical to support the 45% of employees who do not have off-street parking.</p>

<p>To support the roll-out of <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> across fleets and to enable the fleets to effectively charge using the public network, there needs to be a mechanism for Mitie to pay for the electricity used to charge the vehicle directly.</p>

<p>A reclaim system would have a significant cash-flow impact on employees – potentially over £200 a month – acting as a barrier to electrification. Given multiple <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> with their own systems, and typically no commercial account capability, direct agreements are not considered to be a commercially viable approach.</p>

<p>Corporate cards (such as through Visa and Mastercard) require <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> butm even then, will create significant financial control challenges. Mitie’s preferred mechanism is either a recharge card (in the style of a fuel card) allowing the use of all public chargepoints, or a roaming solution through an app or software platform to achieve the same outcome of a fleet operator being able to pay for and reconcile all electricity used through public chargepoints.</p>

<h4>Roaming</h4>

<p>A roaming solution would provide a common method of access to all public chargepoints, including lower-powered chargepoints, through one membership card or smartphone app. It could also provide a payment solution to meet the needs of fleet vehicle drivers.</p>

<p>Several pan-European roaming solutions have been well received by consumers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. These have been supported by public and private sector investment, and can be implemented in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>E-mobility service providers (peer-to-peer model) – E-mobility service providers (eMSPs) are third-party charging aggregators that do not own and operate chargepoints but contract with individual <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and provide a single card or app so that drivers can access all the chargepoints of the <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> with which the third party is contracted.</li>
  <li>Roaming hubs – Platforms that connect eMSPs and <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, linking up their respective back offices. Drivers only need to register with one operator or <abbr title="E-mobility service providers">eMSP</abbr> to have access to all the chargepoints operating on the platform with one contract and invoice<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. eMSPs also use the platforms to agree electricity prices with <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, acting as a clearing house. Most, but not all, eMSPs use roaming hubs to provide their services. Their use is widespread on the continent, with Gireve and Hubject leading the markets in France and Germany respectively. The Gireve platform was established by various companies, including Renault and EDF. It provides access to over 75,000 chargepoints in 20 EU countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roaming requires the interoperability of operating protocols amongst <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and eMSPs. While Gireve and Hubject operate their own proprietary protocols, many eMSPs use the independently developed protocol, Open Chargepoint Protocol (<abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr>). This has been collaboratively developed by industry and represents a more decentralised system. This facilitates billing services (meaning: charge detail records) and provides data to the driver including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>static data on station specifications: connector types, power, location, operator name</li>
  <li>dynamic data on chargepoint availability</li>
  <li>session data after charging session completed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case study – <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> in the Netherlands</h3>

<p>Nearly all public chargepoints in the Netherlands are accessible with a single <abbr title="Radio-frequency identification">RFID</abbr> card. Following direction from the Dutch government, a trade association, eViolin, was launched by <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and freight services in 2012. This ensures payment interoperability through uniform standards across all networks (developed by industry under direction from the government).</p>

<p>eViolin also maintains a Central Interoperability Register, which assigns <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> a unique identification code for chargepoints to be used in payment-related communications between <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, eMSPs and other actors. The Dutch government, in conjunction with distribution network operators (<abbr title="Distribution network operators">DNOs</abbr>), contributes funding and has board representation at the Netherlands Knowledge Platform for Public Charging Infrastructure <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> (<abbr title="Netherlands Knowledge Platform for Public Charging Infrastructure">NKL</abbr>), which coordinates development of the <abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr> protocol.,</p>

<h4>Implementing roaming</h4>

<p>Any roaming solution must balance the potential benefits of improved customer experience and confidence in <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> against the potential impact of implementation costs on a largely new market. We have identified 4 options for consultation.</p>

<p><strong>1) Market-led approach – the government continues to work with industry to establish an industry-led roaming solution, but does not regulate at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>Intervention at this early stage could stifle the market and negatively impact the business case for installing and operating chargepoints. Charging cards for fleets and roaming solutions are emerging, and are expected to continue to develop over time as market grows and utilisation increases. However, in the short to medium term, it’s possible that no common method of access across all chargepoints, or effective payment solution for fleets, will emerge. This would undermine work to ensure a faster transition to mass-market for <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>2) Require all public chargepoints to be accessible via a QR code provided on, or close to, the chargepoint that then directs consumers to a payment platform.</strong></p>

<p>This would provide <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers with a relatively straightforward payment method accessible across the entire network. <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> would still be able to offer membership benefits; however, it would not deliver the payment and billing services required by fleet operators, and is reliant on drivers having access to a smartphone.</p>

<p>We recognise that upgrading the network to provide this facility will mean additional cost for <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and would be in addition to the contactless requirements we’re proposing for rapid and higher-powered chargepoints. We could limit the mandatory provision of the QR code to 3 to 22 kW chargepoints, leaving <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> the choice to provide this facility at rapid and higher-powered chargepoints if they wish.</p>

<p><strong>3) Government establishes an interoperable roaming platform.</strong></p>

<p>We could establish a UK interoperable roaming platform like those operating on the continent. This would enable drivers to access any charger with one membership card or smartphone app. However, it would be highly complex and costly. The full establishment and operation of a platform would require close collaboration with industry participants and require a longer timeframe to introduce.</p>

<p><strong>4) Require <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to open their networks to any third-party <abbr title="E-mobility service providers">eMSP</abbr> or each other without any discrimination.</strong></p>

<p>This would allow multiple roaming business models to emerge (for example, peer-to-peer or roaming hubs) without regulatory mandating of a preferred model. While this approach offers flexibility and advantages to consumers, it relies on <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> sharing commercial information with eMSPs outside of the CPO’s control.</p>

<p>This exposes the CPO to increased operational and reputational risk unless protections are established. There are also significant development and legal costs associated with connecting with other organisations to deliver charging services. In this scenario, we would propose the following supporting measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> in the UK would be required to publish and maintain a roaming tariff: this would reflect both the minimum price a CPO would accept for a third-party <abbr title="E-mobility service providers">eMSP</abbr> to pay per kWh to access their chargepoints and the maximum ad-hoc price they charge – <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> would also publish terms of payment for transparency and to encourage roaming agreements to materialise (such as expected payment timeframe)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> would allow access to a charging station from an <abbr title="E-mobility service providers">eMSP</abbr> that is willing to pay the roaming tariff, agrees to the published terms and meets a minimum level of baseline criteria</li>
  <li>the government would nominate an organisation to maintain a public list of roaming tariffs</li>
  <li>the market would be monitored by an independent body to ensure compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>eMSPs who wish to gain access to <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> through this regulation must meet the following minimum criteria. Any eMSPs that do not satisfy these could still operate in the market, but <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> would not be required to work with them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>minimum baseline criteria will be published and updated annually by the government or another organisation, and relate to the level of technical development, size and business processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>)-regulated eMSPs would be able to secure access to all UK <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> under this regulation: industry and government would work with the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> to deliver a regulatory regime that ensures minimum cybersecurity levels and payment processes by eMSPs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q4</strong>: Do you agree we should intervene now to implement roaming? If not why?</p>

<p><strong>Q6</strong>: Please provide reasons for your answers, including supporting evidence or analysis, and suggest any alternative approaches to achieving roaming. Please state any challenges you foresee and what you would need to address them.</p>

<p><strong>Q7</strong>: Do you agree with our suggested criteria when requiring chargepoint operators to allow access to their network?</p>
</div>

<h3>Provision of data on public electric vehicle chargepoints</h3>

<p>Consumers should be able to locate and access chargepoints with ease.</p>

<p>The lack of mandated data provision adhering to a standard means chargepoint data can be incomprehensive and inaccurate.</p>

<p>More comprehensive, private sector-led solutions are emerging; however, this data is not openly available, meaning there’s a lack of competition in the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> services market.</p>

<p>We propose that government will set a data standard that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> need to meet when making public-chargepoint-data openly available and will mandate that ‘must-have’ data types including location, power-rating and pricing data must be made available.</p>

<p>We propose the data standard should be the internationally recognised <abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr> as this provides the data types we think are likely to be most important to <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to work with <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and wider industry to determine if live ‘availability’ data can be provided without impacting commercial interests.</p>

<h4>Current state of the market and problems to be addressed</h4>

<p>Open, accessible and reliable chargepoint data is essential for innovation, providing information to consumers, strategic network oversight and meeting our net-zero targets. We share the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> Energy Taskforce’s wish for a greater breadth of data types to be openly available and accessible on a consistent and accurate basis<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We want to enable software developers and automotive manufacturers to develop the tools needed to help consumers easily locate and access public chargepoints. This will also support network companies in their investment decisions for reinforcing the electricity grid and procuring flexible solutions.</p>

<p>The government established the National Chargepoint Registry (<abbr title="National Chargepoint Registry">NCR</abbr>) in 2011 to provide a public database of publicly funded chargepoints across the UK. It was intended to encourage <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to publish a freely available static dataset of chargepoints (for example, location, power rating and connectors) to promote the uptake of <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>. But the data is incomplete and contains inaccuracies due to an absence of agreed data sharing standards or incentives on parties to update and maintain their data submissions.</p>

<p>Central and local government and other parties with an interest in network oversight, planning or data sharing, including distribution network operators (<abbr title="Distribution network operators">DNOs</abbr>), rely on oft-incomplete, unstandardised and inconsistent data. This impacts their ability to support network and new services development and optimisation.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zap-map.com/" rel="external">Zap-Map</a>, a user-friendly private-sector solution, is currently the most comprehensive data source available. We want to encourage greater competition and innovation in the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> services space. Most <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> provide data to its platform, including dynamic availability data for 70% of the network.</p>

<h4>Open data proposals</h4>

<p>We developed and tested options for making chargepoint data openly available. This involved comprehensive market research and over 60 interviews with key stakeholders across different sectors including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>central government</li>
  <li><abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr></li>
  <li><abbr title="Distribution network operators">DNOs</abbr></li>
  <li>planners</li>
  <li><abbr title="Original equipment manufacturers">OEMs</abbr></li>
  <li>software developers</li>
  <li>fleets</li>
  <li>power and utilities (<abbr title="Power &amp; Utilities">P&amp;U</abbr>) companies</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data types</h4>

<p>The table below presents a consolidated stakeholder view of ‘must-have’, ‘should have’ and ‘could have’ data types, and our preferred approach for making these data types available. We know that some stakeholders, particularly <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, have concerns about the sharing of live availability data. This is due largely to the commercial sensitivity around the utilisation of chargepoints.</p>

<p>But drivers must have access to the information they need to easily locate and access chargepoints. We invite evidence on options for making live availability data available to consumers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q8</strong>: Are there any ‘must-have’ data types that should not be made available? If not, state which data sets and why, providing evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Q9</strong>: Do you think that the ‘should have’ and ‘could have’ data types should not be mandated to be available now?</p>

<h4>Introduction of the open-data solution</h4>

<p>Data standard(s) for <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> are required to support the introduction of any open-data solution. Standards would specify the data types and the format they should be provided in, in addition to requirements for maintaining the data. They would also set out how provisions for access, storage and transportation of the data.</p>

<p>We propose that government set the standards for open public chargepoint data provision and delegate enforcement powers to an appropriate body. Feedback from stakeholder engagement indicates that most industry stakeholders believe that government is best suited to this role.</p>

<p>We propose to adopt a standard that meets the ‘must have’ data types, reflecting the public chargepoint network’s current and anticipated near-future needs. Adopting a single standard will help ensure consistency of data across the network.</p>

<p>Our preliminary research has indicated that developing a new standard specifically for the UK would be costly, delaying implementation of the recommended data sharing solution. We therefore propose to use the global and freely available <abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr> standard. We propose that the <abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr> latest standard is implemented throughout the CPO system. This would need to be reviewed regularly as the <abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr> standard is updated.</p>

<p>While alternative industry standards exist, <abbr title="Open Chargepoint Protocol">OCPI</abbr> is the most utilised standard not only in the UK but also other international <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> markets. The standard already enables widespread sharing of chargepoint data in Europe and is already familiar to or in use by some UK <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Flexibility to adapt to new standards in the future may be needed as standards or technologies emerge and/or evolve. We’ll keep under review the relevance of new and evolving standards, engaging with industry and consumers before adopting any new standards.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q11</strong>: Do you think that Open Charge Point Interface should be adopted as the standard for the provision of public chargepoint data across the chargepoint operator’s systems?</p>

<p><strong>Q12</strong>: Do you think that adoption of a standard will present challenges? If so, what challenges?</p>
</div>

<h4>Data architecture</h4>

<p>We’ve considered options for an industry-wide digital architecture to making public chargepoint data open and accessible. These have focused on 3 principal architectures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a distributed architecture, where <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> individually publish data and consumers connect with <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> on a bilateral basis</li>
  <li>a federated architecture, where data is ‘sent’ from multiple <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> through one or more platforms.</li>
  <li>a centralised architecture, where <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> ‘push’ their data to a centralised platform</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preferred approach for the industry data architecture</h4>

<p>The research found a hybrid (federated – centralised) data architecture to be the most appropriate solution for the UK. Under this model, <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> would manage their own data, sharing it with a centrally administered data broker through a push mechanism.</p>

<p>This approach provides a single unified interface (an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>) for consumers to access chargepoint data from one location (meaning: a third-party app). Each CPO retains ownership and management of their source data. It avoids creating a disproportionate cost of compliance for those needing to share or access the data. <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> data consumers will only need to access one interface, rather than multiple <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This simplifies the process and reduces costs. <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> would ensure the management and provision of data access complies with the standards and policies set out by the government.</p>

<p>To enable this hybrid architecture, we propose a central <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for use by consumers, and a centralised broker solution (with associated storage) to allow <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> or data providers to share static and dynamic data. Chargepoint data will be openly available for consumption in line with established data-sharing attributes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>, enabling data to be understood consistently by all stakeholders. This will be flexible to grow with the rate of growth of the sector.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1: Overview of the Hybrid Digital Architecture Model</strong></p>

<p>The model includes central storage of aggregated historic and static datasets, which eliminates the dependency and burden on <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to provide reports to support regulatory oversight and enforcement. It enables the creation of longitudinal datasets to inform ongoing government policy development.</p>

<p>Access to specific data sets may be limited to certain user types and this will be determined on a use case-by-use case basis. We’ll conduct a technical discovery, alpha and beta phase with input from industry in line with the Government Digital Service (GDS) code of practice<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>Alignment with Modernising Energy Data</h4>

<p>Modernising Energy Data Access (<abbr title="Modernising Energy Data Access">MEDA</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> is aiming to develop architecture to allow efficient data sharing, and enable interlinking of existing and new datasets, across different sectors. It offers an alternative approach to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#hybrid-digital-architecture-model">hybrid architecture model</a> as it may, for example, offer a solution that enables innovators to auto-pull open data from <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> as needed.</p>

<p>The Energy Data Taskforce (<abbr title="Energy Data Taskforce">EDTF</abbr>) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>, commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>), Ofgem and Innovate UK, published a series of recommendations in June 2019. These advocated a shift towards a ‘presumed open’ data triaging model, centred around making data more visible and accessible through better data management and cataloguing. More efficient exchange of data will allow the energy system to optimise the use of low-carbon energy solutions – including <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints.</p>

<p>While the <abbr title="Energy Data Taskforce">EDTF</abbr> has now ended, the Modernising Energy Data (<abbr title="Modernising Energy Data">MED</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> grou,p made up of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, Ofgem and Innovate UK, has undertaken the implementation of the taskforce vision, alongside the delivery of <abbr title="Modernising Energy Data Access">MEDA</abbr>. If viable, this would enable data-sharing between energy sector bodies, such as the <abbr title="Distribution network operators">DNOs</abbr> and energy suppliers, and reduce costs across the value chain.</p>

<p>Close collaboration with <abbr title="Modernising Energy Data Access">MEDA</abbr> also enables the possibility of reusing emerging data and digital infrastructure from other relevant initiatives. This is an opportunity to develop a coordinated, whole-system approach to data sharing, and to ultimately meet our net-zero targets.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q17</strong>: Do you think the government should use the data architecture that emerges from the Modern Energy Data Access competition as a vehicle for open electric vehicle data?</p>

<h3>Pricing transparency</h3>

<p><abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers should be able to easily compare the cost of charging between different networks.</p>

<p>Electricity drawn from public chargepoints by <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> is currently priced using a range of different metrics. This creates confusion for <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> drivers and a lack of comparability of pricing information between different chargepoint networks.</p>

<p>We propose to mandate <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to adopt a p/kWh metric for a unit of electricity sold under both subscription and pay-as-you-go (<abbr title="Pay as You Go">PAYG</abbr>) models.</p>

<p><abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> will have the flexibility on how they display pricing, consumption and cost information to the customer in a clear and easily accessible manner.</p>

<h4>The current state of the market and the problem we’re trying to solve</h4>

<p>In today’s market, <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> deploy a variety of different formats for pricing the cost of charging an <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr>. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a charge for the electricity drawn (p/kWh)</li>
  <li>a charge for the time spent charging (for example, p/minute or £ per 30 min/hour)</li>
  <li>a flat charge per charging session</li>
  <li>an annual or monthly membership fee, which can result in chargepoints that are free to use or charged at a lower rate per kWh or unit of time</li>
  <li>connection fees (a fee charged to connect to the chargepoint, approximately £1)</li>
  <li>overstay charges for customers staying when the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> has finished charging</li>
</ul>

<p>Most <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> charge for the electricity drawn in p/kWh. But analysis undertaken in August 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup> shows that 8 <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> were charging on a time or per session basis, and 12 were charging connection fees.</p>

<p>In 2016, we consulted on potential pricing formats ahead of the introduction of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/18/contents/enacted" rel="external">Automated and Electric Vehicles Act</a>.  An overwhelming majority of respondents favoured a pricing format of p/kWh.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/897/contents/made" rel="external">Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation 2017 (<abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>)</a> mandates that all public chargepoints must incorporate an intelligent metering system. Information on performance and how this is being converted for billing purposes must be available to customers at the point when they are recharging their vehicles<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup>. <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> can choose how they provide this information – for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>web app</li>
  <li>email</li>
  <li>SMS</li>
  <li>at the chargepoint itself</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these requirements, they do not force <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to charge for electricity drawn in p/kWh.</p>

<h4>Our proposed approach</h4>

<p>We propose to mandate <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to adopt a p/kWh metric for a unit of electricity sold under both subscription and <abbr title="Pay as You Go">PAYG</abbr> models. This would enable consumers to easily compare prices across the UK network and find the best available price. Any regulations brought forward would still permit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to provide free charging under their membership models (the kWhs drawn must be made available to the consumer after the charging event as required by <abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>parking and charging bundled offers, where both are provided in a one-off fee (the kWhs drawn must be made available to the consumer after the charge as required by <abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> applying overstay charges to prevent drivers from blocking a parking space after their charging session has ended</li>
  <li>giving <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> the flexibility on how they display the proposed p/kWh cost of charging to the customer, and then how they display the kWh consumed and the total cost of the charging event, so long as it is clear and easily accessible for all customers</li>
  <li>consumers being paid to provide energy from their <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> to the grid via vehicle to grid (<abbr title="Vehicle to Grid">V2G</abbr>) technology</li>
</ul>

<p>In the medium term, it’s intended that live pricing data will become available via our chosen <a class="govuk-link" href="#open-data">open chargepoint data solution</a>. This would then be available to consumers through third-party apps, further improving pricing transparency.</p>

<p>We propose that compliance with the pricing metric should apply as soon as the regulations come into force and that the unit price for electricity could change between the consumer first identifying a price for charging and then physically arriving at a chargepoint. The price the consumer pays must not change once they have initiated the charging event.</p>

<p>As the cost to the driver will be based on the quantity of electricity supplied, as determined by a meter, we consider that these meters are used for trade. They would therefore constitute a regulated active electrical energy meter which should comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1153/contents/made" rel="external">Measuring Instrument Regulations 2016 (MIR)</a>.</p>

<p>The use of MIR-compliant meters will help ensure that consumers are not short-sold electricity because of an inaccurate meter. We understand that it will be costly for <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to have to retrofit their charging fleet with MIR-compliant meters. Therefore, we propose that this requirement will only apply to newly installed or renewed chargepoints.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q19</strong>: Do you think the government should mandate a p/kWh metric? If not, why?</p>

<p><strong>Q20</strong>: Do you think the government should allow chargepoint operators to have the flexibility to determine how the cost of charging, the energy consumed, and the total cost of a charging event is made available to a consumer?</p>

<p><strong>Q21</strong>: Do you think the government should allow the exemptions to the p/kWh proposal and are there others we should consider?</p>

<p><strong>Q22</strong>: Do you think that Measuring Instruments Regulations-compliant meters should be mandated for newly installed and renewed chargepoints to ensure the energy provided to a vehicle is accurately recorded?</p>

<p><strong>Q23</strong>: Do you think that all chargepoints should have a Measuring Instruments Regulations compliant meters?</p>
</div>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

<p>Consumers should have access to a consistently reliable public charging network.</p>

<p>Public chargepoint reliability is improving. Analysis commissioned by the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles shows that in August 2019 around 8% of public chargepoints were out of service, a decrease from 15% in 2017. However, further improvements are required to drive consumer confidence in the public network.</p>

<p>We propose that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> must meet a minimum 99% availability standard as an average across its entire fleet of chargepoints. We expect industry to work with us to identify an effective approach to monitor reliability.</p>

<p>We propose that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> must provide a 24/7 call helpline for consumers so that help can be provided to consumers who are struggling to access or use a chargepoint.</p>

<p>We propose to allow <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> a one-year lead time from the point the regulations come into force to comply with the standard. This is to enable supply chains and manufactures to respond to improve the reliability of products readily available.</p>

<h4>Current state of the market and the problem we are trying to solve</h4>

<p>Public chargepoints require regular maintenance when used in the public domain. We’re aware of a significant number of chargepoints that are out of action at any one time or have a fault that damages the consumer experience using public chargepoints. This is largely a consequence of <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> or host sites having less of an incentive to repair them when utilisation rates are low.</p>

<p>There are different types of chargepoint failure. These include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>malicious damage – physical or cyber abuse of the chargepoint</li>
  <li>software malfunction (within the chargepoint or via the smartphone app)</li>
  <li>hardware malfunction – wear and tear (for example, chargepoint socket gets worn meaning drivers struggle to connect properly)</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis undertaken by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zap-map.com/" rel="external">Zap-Map</a> in July 2017 showed that 14.8% of public chargepoints or around 1 in 8 were out of service (including 4.1% partially operational)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>. By August 2019, 8% were out of service. This compares with the 99% availability expected by chargepoint operators in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the 2019 analysis is based on 60% of public chargepoints providing availability data to Zap-Map and many <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> cite much higher availability percentages.</p>

<p>Having a significant number of public chargepoints out of order creates inconvenience and frustration for consumers. It risks drivers running out of charge trying to find the next available chargepoint, posing a safety risk if they are left stranded.</p>

<p>Representations from industry highlight that many of the maintenance issues cited by consumers are derived from older charging equipment, some of which installed in the early days of the charging sector by local authorities who did not put in place adequate maintenance contracts.</p>

<p>We understand these views. But reliance on reputational impact alone will not deliver the improvements needed in sufficient time to ensure 99% availability across the network or consumer confidence in the public charging network.</p>

<h4>Our proposed approach</h4>

<p>We propose introducing regulations mandating that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> must meet a 99% availability standard as an average across its entire fleet of chargepoints.</p>

<p>Where a chargepoint has an assumed starting availability of  24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the operator would be allowed up to 4 days’ of downtime per chargepoint for repairs and maintenance a year.</p>

<p>For chargepoints with restricted hours, the 99% standard would apply to those restricted hours. By giving <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> the flexibility to meet the target as an average across its entire fleet, it provides them with longer lead times for more troublesome repairs such as tethered connector replacements.</p>

<p>We’re also proposing to mandate that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> provide a 24/7 call helpline for consumers so that assistance can be provided to consumers who are struggling to access a chargepoint, for example, if a CPO’s app isn’t working correctly on their phone. The provision of this service is already commonplace among most <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>. Consumers must be able to contact an operator for support, and to resolve any issues as quickly and as easily as possible.</p>

<p>We’ve considered applying that 99% standard to all chargepoints on a chargepoint network. But we do not consider this appropriate at this stage. It places a significant burden on <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, giving them very little flexibility in meeting the target at a time when the business case for installing and operating public chargepoints is challenging. A tighter standard may also skew the market towards larger <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> with greater financial backing and the ability to quickly improve their supply chains.</p>

<h4>Implementation of reliability standards</h4>
<p>We recognise that monitoring and reporting of the reliability standard presents challenges due to variation in chargepoint technologies, configurations and communication systems across different chargepoint networks. We want to work with industry to identify a solution to define ‘available’ and establish the best approach to collecting relevant data, where currently this is not openly and readily available. Options could include data collection, self-reporting requirements on <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, or the introduction of a gold-standard certification process.</p>

<p><abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> will need time to improve their supply chains and for manufacturers to improve the reliability of their products, which is an ongoing process. Therefore, we propose to give <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> a one-year lead time from the point the regulations come into force and having to be compliant with the standard.</p>

<p>The 99% fleet average target makes clear the downtime that is allowed across a chargepoint network. Therefore, we do not consider we need to specify repair times in regulations. We’ve considered whether any types of failure warrant exemption from the target in regulations. A failure that is out of the CPO’s control is a power outage causing the supply of electricity from the network connection to cease. Therefore, we would look to exempt this type of failure from the availability standard. <abbr title="Distribution network operators">DNOs</abbr> are responsible for correcting such an outage<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q24</strong>: Do you think that a reliability standard should be set?</p>

<p><strong>Q25</strong>: Do you think that the 99% availability standard should be set on a fleet average basis?</p>

<p><strong>Q26</strong>: Do you have any other suggestions to achieve a more reliable network?</p>

<p><strong>Q27</strong>: Do you agree a one-year lead time for operators to achieve reliability compliance after the regulations come into force is sufficient to implement the reliability proposals?</p>

<p><strong>Q28</strong>: If the reliability metric across fleets was enforced, we propose that there should be exemptions from the availability target that are out of the operator’s control. What types of failures should be exempt?</p>

<p><strong>Q29</strong>: Do you think the government should mandate that chargepoint operators provide 24/7 call centres? Should we mandate this be low-cost or free-to-call?</p>
</div>

<h4>Impact assessment</h4>

<p>A detailed impact assessment will be carried out drawing on the evidence gathered from this consultation. We expect the proposals in this consultation to result in hardware, software and operating costs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retrofit and install necessary equipment to all existing and new chargepoints to meet the minimum payment requirements (<a class="govuk-link" href="#minimum-payment">minimum payment requirements</a>)</li>
  <li>upgrade the chargepoint network to provide a QR code facility (<a class="govuk-link" href="#roaming-2">roaming option 2</a>)</li>
  <li>establish an interoperable roaming platform (<a class="govuk-link" href="#roaming-3">roaming option 3</a>)</li>
  <li>open chargepoint networks to any accredited third party <abbr title="E-mobility service providers">eMSP</abbr> (<a class="govuk-link" href="#roaming-4">roaming option 4</a>)</li>
  <li>gather and present ‘must have’ data (<a class="govuk-link" href="#open-data">open data</a>)</li>
  <li>adopt a p/kWh metric for a unit of electricity (<a class="govuk-link" href="#pricing-transparency">pricing transparency</a>)</li>
  <li>meet a 99% availability standard and provide a 24/7 helpline (<a class="govuk-link" href="#reliability">reliability</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect these costs to be offset by improvements in the consumer experience due to reduced search time, payment time and time planning journeys, and increased comparability of prices, enabling consumers to select the lowest price.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q30</strong>: Provide any cost and consumer data you may have to support a detailed assessment of these impacts (provide separate data for minimum payment methods, roaming, open data, price transparency and reliability).</p>

<p><strong>Q31</strong>: Do you think there are other impacts that have not been identified? If yes, what other impacts are there that you think have not been included (provide supporting evidence)?</p>

<p><strong>Q32</strong>: Are there any groups you expect would be uniquely impacted by these proposals, for example small businesses or people from protected categories? If yes, which groups do you expect would be uniquely impacted by each of these proposals? Provide supporting evidence.</p>
</div>

<h3>Enforcement and penalties</h3>
<p>We’ll work with <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and the wider industry to provide the support and guidance necessary to ensure the smooth introduction of the regulations, and to assist in compliance with the regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>We propose appointing an appropriate body to enforce the regulations. We’ll assess options ahead of the introduction of the regulations. We propose to introduce a similar approach to enforcement as that adopted under the <abbr title="Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations">AFIR</abbr>. The enforcement body will require powers to inspect, test and remove hard and software situated on both public and private land.</p>

<p>We anticipate that, where they consider there to have been a breach of the requirements, they may serve a notice on the person in breach describing the steps required to remedy it and by when. Where a person does not comply with the compliance notice, the enforcement body may require them to pay a civil penalty.</p>

<p>The civil penalty regime will need to be fair and proportionate, and ensure that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> are not penalised for aspects over which they have no control. Any civil penalties will be at the discretion of the enforcement body. This will take various factors into consideration, for example, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nature and perceived intent of the non-compliance</li>
  <li>number of consumers impacted</li>
  <li>frequency of non-compliance</li>
  <li>materiality of a penalty to company finances</li>
</ul>

<h2>Emerging policy areas</h2>

<p>Consumers need <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging to be as easy, if not easier, than current refuelling of petrol and diesel vehicles. Consumer protection is an area of growing importance that cuts across private and public spheres. This section outlines emerging policy areas, including accessibility, weatherproofing, lighting and signage.</p>

<p>We’ve explored these areas through existing user research and we’re seeking feedback on our proposed objectives. We’ll use this to inform our views on the extent to which any further intervention is required at this stage.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q33</strong>: Do you have concerns about consumer protection related to the use of public chargepoints that haven’t been discussed in this consultation? Please provide reasons, analysis or evidence on what other consumer protection issues should be considered by government in the future.</p>
</div>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Anyone, regardless of their mobility, should be able to access <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints. Currently, there’s little in the way of regulation that specifically directs <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> and local authorities to make chargepoints accessible to those who experience disabilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>, goods and services, including petrol filling stations, have a duty to make reasonable adjustments so that everyone can access their facilities. Provisions for adjustments are not prescriptive – leading to a different experience for disabled users depending on the station used.</p>

<p>The switch to mass-market <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> creates a significant opportunity to ensure that the UK has one of the most accessible and user-friendly chargepoint networks, and improves upon internal combustion engine (<abbr title="Internal Combustion Engine">ICE</abbr>) vehicle refuelling infrastructure accessibility. Retrofitting chargepoints is likely to increase costs overall.</p>

<p>An example of the most accessible public chargepoint in the UK is in Salford, which was co-designed with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.peoplesparking.org/" rel="external">People’s Parking</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup>. The bay is a dual blue badge and electric charging bay. In the recent survey by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ridc.org.uk/" rel="external">Research Institute for Disabled Consumers</a><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup>, of the respondents who had seen public charging for <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>, 73% perceived them as neither accessible nor easy to use. 26% categorised ‘finding accessible chargepoints’ as a key concern about owning an <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Case study – Motability, the disability and transport charity</h3>

<p>With the end of the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles rapidly approaching, a large and important group of consumers risk being left behind as we transition to a greener future. 21% of people reported a disability in 2018 to 2019 and that proportion is rising.</p>

<p>Motability estimates that there will be 2.7 million drivers living with disabilities in 2035, with up to 1.35 million partially or wholly reliant on public charging infrastructure. Yet, many components of this infrastructure – such as heavy charging cables, connectors that require force to attach and parking bays without dropped kerbs – are being designed without their needs in mind.</p>

<p>People living with disabilities are also less likely than non-disabled people to own or rent homes where effective home charging solutions can be implemented. Motability argues that if we’re to create a truly inclusive energy transition, accessibility must be a key focus of the <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> consumer experience.</p>

<p>Having a reliable mode of transport is particularly important to those who have a disability. It’s paramount to a person’s independence and autonomy that they can reliably use their vehicle. There are concerns around the current provisions for disabled users at chargepoints. These range from high raised kerbs and insufficient space around bays to charging cables as tripping hazards.</p>

<p>It’s important for any new and emerging technology to be user-friendly, both to support individual drivers and to encourage the widespread take-up of <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>. This is a complex area with responsibilities falling across several parties. We want to continue working with consumer representatives, <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr>, local authorities and other interested parties to understand priority issues and whether there is a need for central government intervention.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q34</strong>: Do you agree with the accessibility issues raised?</p>

<p><strong>Q35</strong>: Are there any accessibility issues we should regulate on?</p>

<p><strong>Q36</strong>: Should there be standards that are enforced/brought in across chargepoints (such as payment height and instructions)? If so, what standards?</p>

<p><strong>Q37</strong>: Do chargepoint operators need to provide supervised stations to help assist those with accessibility needs?</p>
</div>

<h3>Weatherproofing and lighting</h3>

<p>Chargepoints are installed in a diverse range of locations, often in more isolated locations than is the case for fuel stations for diesel or petrol vehicles.</p>

<p>One type of charging location where consumers can feel safe and covered is in a charging hub. Government, Innovate UK and industry have invested in hubs across the UK. The first installation of a hub was in Dundee within walking distance of the city centre with capacity to charge 18 <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> at once, while providing users with a sheltered and well-lit charging location.</p>

<p>Hubs have now been or are being set up in cities across the UK. Many are installed with roofing and lighting, solving issues surrounding weatherproofing, lighting and signage. The Mayor of London has specified the desire to have at least one hub in every sub-region of London.</p>

<p>However, much of the charging on the public network will not be in these types of larger charging hubs. We’re interested in views as to the extent to which requirements are needed to provide specific lighting and/or weatherproofing arrangements in other settings. We need to balance providing a safe experience for <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> consumers with the risk of additional cost and negative impact on local areas’ work to reduce street furniture, which could lead to residential opposition to new installation of public chargepoints<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q38</strong>: Does the lack of weatherproofing and lighting at most chargepoints require improvement? If so, what would this look like in your view?</p>

<p><strong>Q39</strong>: Should any improvement apply to all chargepoints or those in specific locations? If specific locations, can you identify which?</p>
</div>

<h3>Signage</h3>

<p>Drivers need to be able to locate chargepoints quickly and easily while driving. One option to support this would be to introduce signage requirements. We want to balance <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> signage requirements with local approaches to reducing street clutter. There are several existing policies to support locating individual charging points. We do not think additional mandatory requirements are required at this stage; however, we welcome views on this.</p>

<p><abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging is usually delivered in the form of a dedicated <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging or parking bay that is signed at the location to ensure use by <abbr title="Electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>; in common with other parking bays (for example, disabled badge holder bays), direction signs are not erected to them.</p>

<p>There is a dedicated standard on-street parking signage for <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints for use next to an <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> parking space with a chargepoint. Signage is enabled by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/362/contents/made" rel="external">Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions</a> with placement determined by local authorities. Whether <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging spaces require permits and other specific parking requirements is at the discretion of local authorities.</p>

<p>These signs indicate <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint locations in a standardised way without causing too much street clutter. We’ll continue to work with local authorities in providing advice and are currently developing guidance relating to the deployment of chargepoints to reinforce the need for proper signage for <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> parking bays without undermining local authorities’ work to de-clutter their streets.</p>

<p>Currently, chargepoints are not indicated on motorway service area (<abbr title="Motorway Service Area">MSA</abbr>) signage on the motorway. Current regulations require signing indicating up to 6 facilities. These are represented by pictogram symbols for facilities or brand logos and can be a mix of both. MSAs must pay for the cost of the signage (£30 to £40,000) and it’s therefore commonplace for the signage to include 6 of the main brand logos in exchange for a financial contribution from commercial operators.</p>

<p>The current government ambition is to have at least 6 high-powered, open-access chargepoints in every <abbr title="Motorway Service Area">MSA</abbr> in England by 2023. We’ll work with MSAs and <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> to ensure appropriate signage are provided as part of any funding provided under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-vision-for-the-rapid-chargepoint-network-in-england/government-vision-for-the-rapid-chargepoint-network-in-england">Project Rapid</a>. Over the next 5 to 10 years, as <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> charging becomes more profitable, we expect that <abbr title="Chargepoint operators">CPOs</abbr> will become one of the major commercial operators in MSAs and will be able to finance the location of their service, including on the <abbr title="Motorway Service Area">MSA</abbr> approach signage.</p>

<p>Consumers can also find the general location of chargepoints through apps such as Zap-Map, Google Maps and <abbr title="Electric vehicle">EV</abbr> navigation systems. However, the location on such services is not always precise. Implementation of our proposals to open data to third parties will enable other similar services to emerge. More precise latitude and longitude data from public chargepoints will be accessible by vehicle navigation systems and third-party applications pinpointing the exact location of the chargepoint.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q40</strong>: Is signage to chargepoints an area that requires improvement? If so, what would this action look like in your view?</p>
