<h2>Summary - Intervention and impacts</h2>

<h3>Policy background and rationale for intervention</h3>

<p>A Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>) investigation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> into the ‘Investment Consultants Market’ identified weak competition within both the investment consultancy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> (<abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>) and fiduciary management<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> (<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>) markets. These services influence or control decisions affecting pension scheme assets worth at least £1.6 trillion<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, and the retirement incomes of millions of people, so market weakness has extensive adverse impact. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> have introduced an Order with remedies to address the above market failure, which came into force on 10 December 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Two of the remedies will require pension scheme trustees to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out a qualifying tender process<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> when entering into or continuing an agreement with a fiduciary management provider under certain circumstances (Remedy One); and</li>
  <li>set objectives for the investment consultancy provider <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> when entering into an agreement for the provision of investment consultancy (Remedy Seven)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> need to integrate these remedies into pensions legislation to enable the Pensions Regulator (<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) to oversee them. This change should improve <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> market engagement which will improve value for money for members and enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to monitor and enforce compliance.</p>

<p>We intend to replicate these parts of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order so the duties on trustees will continue broadly as they were, although they will report compliance to <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> as the regulator, rather than the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Brief description of viable policy options considered (including alternatives to regulation)</h3>

<h4>1. Do nothing</h4>

<p>By doing nothing, in the 10 years that the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order would be in place (10 December 2019 to 9 December 2029) there would be dual regulatory bodies (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) working with occupational pension schemes. This would cause potential disruption and confusion to the industry along with criticism of an already perceived complex regulatory regime. Therefore, this option is not recommended.</p>

<h4>2. Introduce regulations to replace the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order as of 01 October 2022</h4>

<h4>Preferred Option</h4>

<p>This will ensure more effective supervision of the industry and would allow Government to meet its commitment to introduce regulations.</p>

<h4>3. Alternative to legislation</h4>

<p>Following the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report in 2019, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> produced a joint response with <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to accept <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendations. In the joint response, the government committed to take forward the recommendations put to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to pass legislation which brings the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order into pensions law<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>. Given the public commitment, and to ensure there are not dual regulatory bodies (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) working with occupational pension schemes, alternative to legislation is not appropriate.</p>

<h3>Preferred option: Summary of assessment of impact on business and other main affected groups</h3>

<p>The counterfactual is based on the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order which will be in force from 10 December 2019 to 9 December 2029. Our regulations will replicate part three (Remedy One) and part seven (Remedy Seven) of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order to bring compliance and enforcement under the remit of <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>. Therefore, the impacts assessed are those in addition to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<h4>Impact on Business</h4>

<p>We expect trustees will have to familiarise themselves with the new requirements to report compliance to <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> through the scheme return rather than through a compliance statement to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. We assume schemes will already have been complying with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order for 2 years and therefore, the familiarisation process will be simple. We estimate a total familiarisation cost of £1,220,000 in the first year only (2022/23).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order requires trustees to submit a compliance statement to confirm they have complied with the Order. This requirement will remain when <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> take over compliance and enforcement. The ongoing cost to schemes will be determined by differences between the questions in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> statement and the questions in the <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> scheme return. These differences are because of the regulator having to ask specific questions to determine the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> information that is not necessarily included in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> compliance statement. We estimate an ongoing total cost to all eligible schemes of £39,000 in each year.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order excluded certain schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> which we will instead bring into scope. These schemes will be required to set objectives<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> for the investment consultancy provider. The impact on the 8 schemes in scope is a total one-off cost in the first year of £278,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> and an ongoing cost per year of £286,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We will require schemes which delegated 20% (or more) of scheme assets without a competitive tender process in the period from 11 June 2019 to 9 December 2019 to tender for the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services provided by the relevant providers within a 5-year period of the earliest delegation (unless the scheme falls below the 20% threshold and does not come back up to or above it within that period). These schemes will bear the cost of tendering for those <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services on one occasion within that grace period. For the estimated 19 tenders in scope, the one-off cost is £97,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> split evenly from 1 October 2022 to 9 December 2024.</p>

<h3>Impact on Regulatory Bodies</h3>

<h4><abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr></h4>

<p>As a result of the regulations bringing compliance and enforcement under the remit of <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will be required to:</p>

<p>• amend the scheme return;</p>

<p>• monitor compliance with the regulations and identify non-compliance;</p>

<p>• take enforcement activity where necessary</p>

<p><abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> is funded by the General Levy paid by all registered pension schemes with more than one member. This levy and its impact are excluded from the definition of a regulatory provision in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. Therefore, it does not need to be reported on or verified under the Business Impact Target reporting requirements. Any increases in the levy therefore do not count towards the Equivalent Annual Net Direct Costs to Business (<abbr title="Equivalent Annual Net Direct Costs to Business">EANDCB</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will be incorporating this work into business as usual and do not anticipate that this will have an impact on the Levy. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> estimates the total costs in year 1 (2022/23) to be £69,000 (including one-off set up costs) and the ongoing costs to be £59,000 per year using 2014 powers<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. These cost estimates are based on several assumptions set out in the additional detail section and are rounded up to the nearest £1,000.</p>

<h4><abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr></h4>

<p><abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will no longer incur the costs associated with enforcing compliance against the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. This will result in an annual saving of £4,000, totalling £27,000 by the time the Order has concluded on 9 December 2029<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Preferred option</h3>

<h4>Evidence behind the rationale for intervention</h4>

<p>On 14 September 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>) published its decision to refer the supply and acquisition of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup> services to institutional investors and employers in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> for a market investigation. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> carried out an investigation into the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> market in 2017 and 2018. Having concluded this investigation and decided what action needs to be taken, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has introduced an Order<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup> which came into force on December 2019.</p>

<p>The Order implements the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> remedies to address weak competition found within the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> markets. Low engagement by some pension trustees, and difficulties accessing information, reduce the competitive pressure on investment consultants and fiduciary managers. As a result, pension scheme members may expect to pay higher prices for these services and receive a lower quality service than in more competitive markets. This lack of competition currently causes financial detriment for employer sponsors of Defined Benefit (<abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr>) schemes and members of Defined Contribution (<abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr>) schemes. Both <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services are used extensively by both <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> pension schemes. Any negative impact on scheme outcomes will be significant, accumulating and compounding over the long time horizon over which pension assets are invested<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>, typically spanning several decades<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>. According to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, these services have a major influence on pension scheme outcomes, affecting up to half of all <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> households<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup>. This change should improve trustee engagement with their <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> appointments which will improve value for money for members and enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to monitor and enforce compliance.</p>

<h4>Proposed Intervention</h4>

<p>The counterfactual is based on the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order which came into force on 10 December 2019 and is set to end on 9 December 2029. The counterfactual covers the vast majority of the appraisal period.</p>

<p>The regulations will come into force on 01 October 2022, 34 months after the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order was first introduced on 10 December 2019. Once regulations are in place, schemes will not be required to do anything differently to the requirements in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order except for the slight differences outlined below which we have quantified where possible.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order expires on 9 December 2029 meaning there will a period at the end of the appraisal period where the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order will no longer be in force.</p>

<p>We propose the impacts incurred from the expiration of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order to the end of the appraisal period are not material and follow business as usual. Any cost incurred takes place 10 years or more after the original <abbr title="coming into force">CIF</abbr> (coming into force) date of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<p>By the end of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, mandates would have already been tendered for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services and objectives set for <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> providers. Therefore, the only costs incurred during this period would be ongoing reporting costs. Schemes would have already completed the existing <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> scheme return 8 times, hence reporting does not require any additional familiarisation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> intervened to address the adverse effect on competition it had identified (primarily in relation to the conduct of providers and trustees). If, in year 9, providers or schemes were to engage in conduct that may result in the same or similar adverse effect on competition, there is a risk of further investigation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For 4 aspects there will be slight differences in policy between the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and these regulations. These are detailed below.</p>

<p>1. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order excludes certain schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> from remedies one and seven. <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> employer-sponsored master trusts and corporate schemes will now bear the cost of setting and monitoring investment objectives, we estimate there are 8 pension schemes affected by this measure.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> have used interconnected body corporate<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup> of the provider, or a partnership or ’joint venture‘ with the provider to determine whether organisations are connected and therefore whether a scheme is sponsored by an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> or connected body. We are proposing to use group undertaking<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup> to capture the full range of relationships. We do not know precisely how many organisations will be impacted by this policy change.</p>

<p>3. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> have regulated for the Local Government Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>) to be in scope of remedy 7. We do not intend to replicate this measure. We have made no provision for applying remedy 7 to the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr>, as regulations and guidance in relation to the <abbr title="Local Government Pension Scheme">LGPS</abbr> are a matter for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.</p>

<p>4. We will require schemes which delegated 20% (or more) of scheme assets without a competitive tender process in the period from 11 June 2019 to 9 December 2019 to tender for the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services provided by the relevant providers within a 5-year period of the earliest delegation (unless the schemes fall below the 20% threshold and do not come back up to or above it in that period). This means these schemes will bear the cost of tendering for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services provided by those existing providers on one occasion within that period.</p>

<p>The penalty process that will be adopted under <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations will follow the same process as is already in place and enforced by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> for the automatic enrolment charges measures.</p>

<h3>Costs and Benefits to Businesses <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>
</h3>

<h4>Trustees - Familiarisation</h4>

<p>We assume that it will take trustees 114 minutes to familiarise themselves with the new requirements which would involve reading and understanding the regulations and checking <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> guidance where necessary. This is an assumption based on the length of regulations (19 pages) and an assumed time of 6 minutes to read a page<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup>. We do not have a definitive figure for the total number of trustees that will be impacted so we estimated this using the number of schemes impacted multiplied by the average number of trustees per scheme. There are 5,220 <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes with 2+ members<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup> and there are 2,335 <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> Schemes with 2+ members<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>. For <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes with 2+ members, we estimate an average of 3.0 trustees per scheme and for <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes with 2+ members, we estimate an average of 2.7 trustees per scheme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>. We assume that trustees will be able to read and understand the regulations based on the requirement for trustees to have knowledge and understanding of the law relating to pensions and trusts<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>. We assume the average hourly wage of a trustee is estimated to be around £29 per hour<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>. This gives a total familiarisation cost of £1,220,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup> in the first year only (2022/23). We believe this is a cautious approach because not all trustees may need to familiarise themselves with the new requirements. Assuming only one trustee per scheme needs to familiarise themselves, this would give an estimate of £416,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup> in the first year only (2022/23).</p>

<h4>Trustees - Ongoing cost</h4>

<p>Trustees will be required to check their compliance, complete details on the statement, sign and send to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. As a result of bringing compliance and enforcement under the remit of <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>, trustees will be required to report compliance through additional questions in their existing scheme return. Table 1 sets out the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> reporting requirements. The questions for inclusion in the <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> scheme return ask for additional information to what is required for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> compliance statement such as names and addresses of ICs and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> providers and the dates they were appointed.</p>

<h3>Table 1: <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> Reporting requirements</h3>

<h3>
<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Reporting Requirements</h3>

<p>Trustees must submit a compliance statement in the following format and signed certificate to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> annually, confirming to what extent they have been compliant with the requirements of remedy one and remedy seven, during the reporting period.</p>

<p>Investment Consultancy and Fiduciary Management Market Investigation Remedy Compliance Statement for [insert name]</p>

<p>If the trustees are aware of any failure to comply with the requirements, they must report such compliance to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> within 14 days of becoming aware of it, and provide a brief description of the steps taken to address the failure.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Reporting Requirements to be used by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For Remedies one and seven the current scheme return process will be followed<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup> and trustees will have the following additional questions:</p>

<p>For <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> Services</p>

<p>(a) the name and address of the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider;</p>

<p>(b) the most recent date on which the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider was appointed;</p>

<p>(c) whether the trustees have set objectives for the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider, and if not, why not;</p>

<p>(d) whether the trustees have reviewed the objectives set for the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider and if not, why not;</p>

<p>(e) whether the trustees have reviewed the services provided by the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider and if not, why not.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> Services</p>

<p>(a) the name and address of the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider;</p>

<p>(b) the most recent date on which the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider was appointed;</p>

<p>(c) whether the trustees carried out a qualifying tender process<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup> in connection with the appointment or most recent change in the provider’s mandate, and</p>

<p>(d) if no such tender was carried out, why not.</p>

<p>Trustees will need to know this information to report compliance to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, but it may take additional resource to compile the information and complete the questions in the scheme return. We assume it would take one administrator per scheme an additional 20 minutes to source and compile the required names, addresses and dates, as we would expect a scheme to maintain records on their suppliers and recent tender processes. There are 5,220 <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes with 2+ members<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup> and there are 2,335 <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> Schemes with 2+ members<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup>. We assume the average hourly wage of an administrator is around £16 per hour<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup>. This gives an ongoing cost of £39,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup> in each year.</p>

<h4>Costs to business from extension of scope to include schemes where the principal or controlling employer of a scheme is themselves a provider of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services and Master Trusts for which an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm is the scheme strategist or scheme funder</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order has excluded certain schemes from both remedies one and seven. These include schemes where the principal or controlling employer of a scheme is themselves a provider of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services, and Master Trusts for which an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm (or a group undertaking of the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm) is the scheme strategist or scheme funder. It would be impractical in these circumstances to expect the scheme trustees to carry out a qualifying tender. However, we believe it is reasonable for the trustee of employer-sponsored master trusts or corporate schemes to set their <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> objectives, regardless of whether the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> is related to the sponsoring employer of the scheme. This means these schemes will now bear the cost of setting and monitoring investment objectives.</p>

<p>We estimate that there are 8 pension schemes affected by this measure.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We are aware of 4 master trusts sponsored by <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firms, all of which have now received authorisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 10 to 15 other <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> providers but some of these will use another organisation’s master trust or a personal pension scheme as a qualifying scheme for automatic enrolment. All firms will need to use a pension scheme for automatic enrolment, and they have 3 options – own trust, personal pension or someone else’s master trust. In the absence of any more knowledge, we assume the remaining 10 to 15 firms are split between these 3 options. This means 3 to 5 firms also have their own trust giving a central estimate of 4. We therefore estimate 4 more <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> sponsored single employer schemes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> provided a sample<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> of data on costs for remedy 7, gathered over the course of their investigation. Table 2 summarises the minimum, maximum and average costs to trustees to set strategic objectives and report against them, based on this sample of data. This includes both one-off costs in the first year and ongoing costs per year.</p>

<p>Source: Responses to Competition and Markets Authority information requests</p>

<p>Some respondents in the sample reported that they already set objectives for all clients, therefore the cost to trustees to set strategic objectives and report against them was zero in these cases.</p>

<p>We assume the 8 pension schemes affected by this measure are equally as likely to have already set objectives as the schemes in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> sample which means our best estimate of the cost to schemes would be an average including these zero responses.</p>

<p>Across the 8 schemes in scope, this therefore gives a one-off cost in the first year of £278,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup> and an ongoing cost of £286,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>Costs to business from change in scope because of the difference between interconnected body corporate and group undertaking</h4>

<p>We propose to use group undertaking rather than interconnected body corporate to define interconnected firms. This is because ownership relationships involving partnerships can still signify influence and control.</p>

<p>This change extends the range of schemes that are considered part of a group. A very small number of schemes who were not previously treated as connected to an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider and were therefore previously required both to tender and to set objectives in accordance with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order will now only be required to set objectives (we are excluding these schemes from remedy 1, but not remedy 7). We might reasonably anticipate that the majority of ICs and FMs will already be interconnected bodies corporate, because they are corporate bodies rather than partnerships or other unincorporated organisations. In the absence of any other evidence, we have assumed that fewer than 5 schemes will be excluded from remedy 1 because of this.</p>

<p>The effect of changing references in the definition of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services means that the services of firms who are not an interconnected body corporate but are a group undertaking will fall into scope of an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service so the trustees who use them will now be required to run a qualifying tender. Given that there are fewer than ten <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services, we assume that the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> captured all such schemes, and our amendment is to future-proof the regulations. Therefore, we could assume that no additional firms are in scope and assume no additional costs to business.</p>

<p>The effect of changing references to qualifying tender means that in certain instances where trustees were previously planning to run a qualifying tender with 2 firms who were not an interconnected body corporate but were a group undertaking, these would under our regulations count as only one firm, requiring the trustees to make endeavours to obtain an additional bid from a fiduciary management provider. We assume trustees would know to avoid more than one approach to firms which formed a group undertaking and would instead seek a different tender. They would not need to use reasonable endeavours to secure a tender from a fourth firm. This change would simply require them to use different criteria in identifying firms to approach before they make reasonable endeavours to encourage them to do so and to evaluate the tender received. Therefore, we could assume no additional costs to business of a change to the scope of this measure.</p>

<p>We are not replicating the use of ‘joint venture’ to determine whether organisations are connected (and therefore outside of remedies 1 and 7). We do not believe that any schemes will be affected by this change because the draft order on which the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> consulted did not mention joint ventures and it was not raised in any of the responses made by stakeholders.</p>

<h4>One-off cost to tender fiduciary management (<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>) services commissioned between 11 June and 9 December 2019</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services tendering requirements in Part 3 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s Order came into force on 10 December 2019. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order requires that, from 10 December 2019, trustees should carry out a competitive tender before awarding a fiduciary management mandate, or making changes to such a mandate, which will mean that 20% (or more) of the schemes relevant assets are delegated to persons providing <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services (other than excepted persons). ‘Relevant assets’ are any of the schemes assets which are not being managed by an excepted person. In some cases, the trustees will also have to carry out a competitive tender process in respect of arrangements entered into before the threshold is met or exceeded.</p>

<p>In respect of delegations made before 11 June 2019 (to persons other than excepted persons), without a competitive tender, and which cover 20% (or more) of the relevant assets of the scheme, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order requires trustees to have completed a competitive tender process within 5 years from the earliest of those delegations. Where the 5-year period expired on 10 June 2019 (or will expire by 10 June 2021), the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order requires trustees to have completed a competitive tender process by 10 June 2021. Our Regulations place an obligation on trustees to have completed an equivalent tender by the end of 1 October 2022. Trustees who complied with the requirement in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order before our Regulations came into force are not required to re-tender the relevant arrangements.</p>

<p>We will require schemes which delegated 20% (or more) of the scheme’s relevant assets without a competitive tender process in the period from 11 June 2019 to 9 December 2019 to tender for the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services provided by the relevant providers within a 5-year period of the earliest delegation (unless the schemes fall below the 20% threshold and do not come back up to or above it in that period). This means these schemes will bear the cost of tendering for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services provided by those existing providers on one occasion within that period.</p>

<p>We estimate 19 tenders have been carried out between 11 June and 9 December which are now in scope of these regulations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>According to ISIO, there were 946 delegations in 2019 and 1015 delegations in 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup> indicating a flow of 69 delegations per 12 months or 35 delegations per 6 months</li>
  <li>In 2018, 85% of schemes delegated more than 29% of assets.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup> In the absence of any other data, we have used the proportion of schemes delegating more than 29% of assets as a proxy for the proportion of schemes delegating 20% of assets<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Trustees who have already tendered are not affected by this change. In 2016, 34% of customers buying <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services carried out a formal tender so 66% were not tendered<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Therefore, we estimate this will result in 19 tenders<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> provided a sample<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup> of data on costs for remedy one, gathered over the course of their investigation. Table 3 summarises the range of minimum, maximum and average one-off costs to trustees to tender for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services, based on this sample of data. Firms provided a range for the cost of tendering for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services, so this has been presented using the lower and upper bounds.</p>

<p>Source: Responses to Competition and Markets Authority information requests</p>

<p>These cost estimates include the cost of a Third Party Evaluator (<abbr title="Third Party Evaluator">TPE</abbr>), which schemes are not required to use so we assume costs will be lower than the estimates provided and have therefore taken the minimum cost provided of £5,000 per scheme to tender for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services. The cost of tendering <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services should be lower than the estimates in table 3 because the use of <abbr title="Third Party Evaluator">TPE</abbr> is optional. According to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://home.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/uk/pdf/2019/10/Fiduciary-Management-Survey.PDF" rel="external">KPMG Report</a>, 61% of schemes reported using independent advice when selecting a fiduciary manager in 2019 and there is a ‘clear benefit of independent advice for schemes. However, the use of <abbr title="Third Party Evaluator">TPE</abbr> is not a legislative requirement and therefore the cost of using a <abbr title="Third Party Evaluator">TPE</abbr> has not been assessed as a business burden. The sensitivities around this have been considered later in the impact assessment.</p>

<p>For the 19 tenders in scope the one-off cost is £97,000 split evenly from 01 October 2022 to 9 December 2024. Based on these regulations coming into force on 01 October 2022, the cost to schemes are £44,000 in year 1 (2022/23), £44,000 in year 2 (2023/24) and £8,000 in year 3 (2024)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Costs and Benefits to Other Affected Parties</h3>

<h4>Benefits to schemes (in counterfactual)</h4>

<p>On the benefits resulting from competitive tendering, evidence in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> indicates schemes that ran a formal tender paid significantly lower fees (on average) than those who did not. The baseline results indicate that the average scheme could save almost £600,000 over a ten-year period because of running a formal tender. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s indication of the cumulative impact of such savings across pensions schemes, assuming there are 40 additional tenders a year as a result of remedy one, would be an annual saving in the range of £540,000 to £3.24m. They also state that the benefits are far wider than a potential reduction in fees and overall benefits for schemes will be much larger as this does not consider the wider benefits resulting from higher quality of service.</p>

<p>On the benefits resulting from setting objectives, according to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> this will drive greater engagement by trustees, helping them to monitor the quality of their investment consultant and increasing competitive pressure to ensure the investment consultant is offering a high quality of service<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup>. It was not possible for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to quantify all the potential benefits with precision<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>These benefits will arise as a result of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and are therefore already realised in the counterfactual of the preferred option.</p>

<h4>Benefits to scheme members (in counterfactual)</h4>

<p>According to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, millions of pension scheme members and their dependents are affected by advice and decisions from investment consultants and fiduciary managers. The <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> (Pension Protection Fund) estimate there are just under 10 million people in private sector <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> estimate there are around 23 million members in <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>These benefits will arise as a result of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and are therefore already realised in the counterfactual of the preferred option.</p>

<h4>Benefits to schemes (additional to counterfactual)</h4>

<p>As a result of increased scope of our regulations compared to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, an additional 8 pension schemes will now be required to set and monitor investment objectives. We expect the benefits to schemes to be in line with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s expectations that this will help trustees to monitor the quality of service provided by their investment consultant. As it was not possible for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to quantify the direct benefits resulting from setting strategic objectives, we have not quantified this benefit.</p>

<h4>Costs to <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Table 4 sets out the estimated set up costs provided by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>. Table 5 sets out the estimated costs provided by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> for monitoring and enforcing compliance with remedies 1 and 7 using 2014 powers. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will be incorporating this work into business as usual and do not anticipate that this will have an impact on the Levy. These cost estimates are rounded up to the nearest £1,000.</p>

<p>Source: The Pensions Regulator estimate, unpublished data</p>

<p>These cost estimates are based on the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The costings are estimated on existing processes and do not include the potential costs of more complex cases that might arise</li>
  <li>There is insufficient data to make robust assumptions on the number of schemes in scope for the 2 remedies and in turn the estimated number of cases which might arise. (<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> do not have a robust estimate for the number of breaches per annum)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will adopt a flexible risk appetite in response to volumes of non-compliance reporting</li>
  <li>One-off costs are based on adopting existing processes and adding questions to the scheme return. These costs would be higher if new processes have to be established</li>
</ul>

<p>We have not quantified the cost to <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> of consulting on and producing guidance for trustees in support of the remedies because this is based on the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendation which <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> have accepted rather than being a requirement of the regulations.</p>

<p>As the relevant sector regulator, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> expects to allocate resource towards enforcing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations through robust compliance monitoring. Hence, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> costs are greater than the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> savings.</p>

<h4>Benefits to <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>
</h4>

<p>With regards to compliance, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will no longer incur the costs associated with enforcing compliance against the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. The estimated annual cost of <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> compliance is £4,000, totalling £27,000 by the expiration of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote">[footnote 56]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Wider Economic and Societal Impacts</h3>

<p>The intended impact is better value for pension scheme members through better access to the information trustees need to assess value for money (fees, costs, quality etc.) <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> sponsoring employers and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> members are less likely to pay higher prices for lower quality services for <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> than they otherwise would. In turn this can have a major impact on pension scheme outcomes through the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> influence on the overall strategy, asset allocation and risk management. Any positive impact on scheme outcomes will accumulate and compound over time, especially given the length of many <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> appointments, and the time horizon over which pension scheme investment decisions are made.</p>

<p>Increased competition may lead to more switching in the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> market and challenge dominance of incumbent firms providing services, allowing smaller firms or specialist consultants to enter the market. This may in turn encourage schemes to be more adventurous around alternative investments which require specialist advice, such as infrastructure. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> took the view that this was a proportionate regulatory intervention to address the adverse effect on competition of the current market situation and that this remedy was intended to have a positive overall effect on competition.</p>

<h3>Key Assumptions and Sensitivity Analysis</h3>

<p>The following are key areas of sensitivity for the costs of the regulations and extension of scope compared to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<h4>1. One-off cost to trustees to familiarise themselves</h4>

<p>We assume it will take all trustees 114 minutes to familiarise themselves with the new requirements giving a total familiarisation cost of £1,220,000 in the first year only (2022/23). When allowing for sensitivity around this assumption of 50% (i.e. 57 or 171 minutes), holding everything else constant the cost estimate decreases to £610,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote">[footnote 57]</a></sup> and increases to £1,829,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote">[footnote 58]</a></sup>. The remaining assumptions used in this calculation are based on the latest data from the Pension Protection Fund, The Pensions Regulator and the Office for National Statistics.</p>

<h4>2. Ongoing cost to trustees to source and compile the additional information required for <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> scheme return</h4>

<p>We assume it would take one administrator per scheme 20 minutes to source and compile the required names, addresses and dates giving a total ongoing cost of £39,000 in each year. When allowing for sensitivity around this assumption of 50% (i.e. 10 or 30 minutes), holding everything else constant the cost estimate decreases to £20,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote">[footnote 59]</a></sup> and increases to £59,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:60" rel="footnote">[footnote 60]</a></sup>. The remaining assumptions used in this calculation are based on the latest data from the Pension Protection Fund, The Pensions Regulator and the Office for National Statistics.</p>

<h4>3. One-off and ongoing cost to the additional 8 schemes in scope to set objectives and report against them</h4>

<p>We assume there are 8 schemes in scope based on master trusts sponsored by <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firms and other <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> providers that we are aware of. We assume the 8 pension schemes affected by this measure are equally as likely to have already set objectives as the schemes in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> sample giving a total one-off cost in the first year of £278,000 and an ongoing cost per year of £286,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote">[footnote 61]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When allowing for sensitivity around the volume assumptions of 50% (i.e. 4 and 12 schemes in scope), holding everything else constant it has the following impact on the cost estimates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One-off cost decreases to £139,000 and increases to £417,000;</li>
  <li>Ongoing cost per year decreases to £143,000 and increases to £429,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote">[footnote 62]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When allowing for sensitivity around the cost assumptions based on the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> evidence, the minimum one-off and ongoing costs would be £0, and the maximum one-off and ongoing costs would be in excess of £800,000. Using the average excluding zeros (i.e. if the 8 schemes impacted all incur a cost), holding everything else constant it has the following impact on the cost estimates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One-off cost increases to £445,000;</li>
  <li>Ongoing cost per year increases to £458,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:63" rel="footnote">[footnote 63]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Ongoing cost to trustees from change in scope (as a result of the difference between interconnected body corporate and group undertaking)</h4>

<p>We do not know precisely how many organisations will be impacted by this policy change.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We have assumed that the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> captured all schemes which now fall into scope of an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service in the counterfactual and therefore that no additional trustees are required to run a qualifying tender and there is no additional cost to business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have assumed that, based on our regulations, trustees would know to avoid more than one approach to firms which formed a group undertaking and would instead seek a different tender and therefore that no additional trustees are required to make endeavours to obtain an additional bid from an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider and there is no additional cost to business</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>5. One-off cost to tender 19 fiduciary management (<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>) delegations commissioned between 11 June and 9 December 2019</h4>

<p>We have estimated there are 19 tenders in scope based on the evidence from the ISIO Survey and <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Report and that the cost to tender for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services will not include the cost of a <abbr title="Third Party Evaluator">TPE</abbr>, giving a one-off cost of £97,000 which is split evenly from 01 October 2022 to 9 December 2024<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:64" rel="footnote">[footnote 64]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When allowing for sensitivity around the volume assumptions of 50% (i.e. 10 and 29 delegations in scope), holding everything else constant, the one-off cost decreases to £51,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote">[footnote 65]</a></sup> and increases to £148,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:66" rel="footnote">[footnote 66]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When allowing for sensitivity around the cost assumptions based on the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> evidence, the average one-off cost would be £22,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:67" rel="footnote">[footnote 67]</a></sup> and the maximum one-off cost would be £66,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:68" rel="footnote">[footnote 68]</a></sup>. Holding everything else constant the one-off cost increases to £421,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:69" rel="footnote">[footnote 69]</a></sup> and £1,262,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:70" rel="footnote">[footnote 70]</a></sup> respectively.</p>

<h4>6. Ongoing <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> savings to not enforce Order once <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations have been set (until the expiration of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order)</h4>

<p>We assume the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> compliance process takes 6 weeks to enforce resulting in an annual saving of £4,000 per year. When allowing for sensitivity around the time assumptions of 50 per cent (i.e. 3 and 9 weeks), holding everything else constant, the one-off saving decreases to £2,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:71" rel="footnote">[footnote 71]</a></sup> and increases to £6,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:72" rel="footnote">[footnote 72]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations come into force the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> confirmed they will no longer enforce the Order. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations are scheduled to come into force on 01 October 2022 and the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order will conclude on 10 December 2029. The period between the start of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations and the end of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order is 7.17 years, resulting in a total saving of £27,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:73" rel="footnote">[footnote 73]</a></sup>. When allowing for sensitivity around the time assumptions of 50% (i.e. 3 and 9 weeks), holding everything else constant, the total saving decreases to £14,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:74" rel="footnote">[footnote 74]</a></sup> and increases to £41,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:75" rel="footnote">[footnote 75]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>7. One-off and ongoing costs to <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The cost estimates provided by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> using 2014 powers, give a one-off cost of £10,000 in the first year and an ongoing cost of £59,000. When allowing for sensitivity around the one-off cost assumptions of 50%, one-off costs decrease to £5,000 and increase to £15,000. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> provided conservative and worst-case scenario estimates for the number of mandatory tendering breaches. This resulted in a lower-bound ongoing cost of £45,000 and an upper-bound ongoing cost of £73,000<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:76" rel="footnote">[footnote 76]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Small and Micro Business Assessment</h3>

<h4>Scope of Regulations</h4>

<p>The proposed regulations will affect <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> pension schemes with 2+ members including hybrid schemes but excluding Executive Pension Schemes (<abbr title="Executive Pension Schemes">EPSs</abbr>) and Small Self-Administered Schemes (<abbr title="Small Self-Administered Schemes">SSASs</abbr>) The regulations will affect pension scheme trustees and sponsoring employers regardless of sector or size.</p>

<p>These small and micro pension schemes (<abbr title="Executive Pension Schemes">EPSs</abbr> and <abbr title="Small Self-Administered Schemes">SSASs</abbr>) have been deemed out of scope of the regulations as it would be disproportionate for it to apply to them. For these schemes, where the members are all trustees, or directors of a corporate trustee, it would be unreasonable to make trustees undertake the time and cost to tender or set objectives when they are already directly incentivised to do so to improve their own outcomes.</p>

<p>Most small businesses do not administer their own pension schemes, but instead use an external provider to meet their duties.</p>

<h4>Findings from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Report</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> found that small schemes and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes are less engaged in the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> market<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:77" rel="footnote">[footnote 77]</a></sup> and the supply of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services to smaller pension schemes is particularly unconcentrated<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:78" rel="footnote">[footnote 78]</a></sup>. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report defines ‘small’ schemes as those with assets below £100 million.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> survey found that smaller schemes are less likely than larger schemes to purchase <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>49% of smaller pension schemes use <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services compared to 94% of large schemes</li>
  <li>18% of smaller pension schemes buy <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services compared to 26% of large schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:79" rel="footnote">[footnote 79]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In their report<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:80" rel="footnote">[footnote 80]</a></sup>, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> highlighted concern that the costs or time required for mandatory tendering may result in a scheme incurring costs which could represent a greater relative burden on smaller schemes. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> however concluded that the mandatory tendering remedy should have no minimum threshold for scheme size as this would reduce effectiveness (the problems are more prominent amongst smaller schemes so including a minimum threshold and exempting these schemes would mean these benefits would not be realised). This suggests small and micro schemes may be disproportionately impacted by these regulations as they may need to invest relatively more resources in meeting the new requirements. As the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> have not excluded these small and micro schemes in their Order (with the exception of <abbr title="Executive Pension Schemes">EPSs</abbr> and <abbr title="Small Self-Administered Schemes">SSASs</abbr>) these schemes are already in scope in the counterfactual of the preferred option.</p>

<h4>Data on <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> Schemes by Size</h4>

<p>Table 6 shows that the majority of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes have more than 100 members though there are a significant number of schemes with fewer than 100 members. Table 7 shows that the majority of <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes in scope have fewer than 100 members. These tables refer to scheme size and are not a direct measure of the number of employees in the underlying sponsoring employer. The vast majority of members are in schemes with more than 100 members<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:81" rel="footnote">[footnote 81]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The costs to business fall to the trustees of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes so small and micro businesses that sponsor <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes may be affected. Small and micro businesses would not be directly impacted by the change in regulation, but they may face indirect costs if small schemes face higher relative charges that are then passed onto sponsoring employers. However, assessing the impact of the proposed changes on this group is difficult, as small and micro pension schemes may not necessarily correspond to small and micro businesses<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:84" rel="footnote">[footnote 84]</a></sup>. As there is currently no robust evidence to link pension scheme size to employer size, it is disproportionate to accurately assess the impact on small and micro businesses.</p>

<p>The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (<abbr title="Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings">ASHE</abbr>) dataset provides information on the size of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> sponsoring employers with active members. This will only include those who are contributing to a <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> or <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> pension so will exclude members who are in schemes closed for future accrual but it helps to provide an indication of the size of sponsoring employers.</p>

<p>Table 8 shows the proportion of Private sector and Not for Profit active <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> members by employer size. The majority of active <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> members work in businesses with 50 or more employees. 15% and 4% of active <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> members work in Small and Micro businesses respectively<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:85" rel="footnote">[footnote 85]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If small and micro businesses use smaller sized pension schemes (rather than participating in a multi-employer scheme) then they may encounter a higher cost because of the regulation relative to their overall cost, but they will benefit from the introduction of the requirements. However, small and micro businesses are not the same as small and micro pension schemes.</p>

<p>Small and micro businesses make up more than 50% of active NEST membership<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:90" rel="footnote">[footnote 90]</a></sup>. As many small and micro businesses use large pension schemes, we anticipate no disproportionate impact.</p>

<p>A Post-Implementation Review (<abbr title="Post-Implementation Review">PIR</abbr>) has been added to the Statutory Instrument (<abbr title="Statutory Instrument">SI</abbr>). <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has committed to a review of the regulations and a report will be published by 31 December 2028.

      <p>Analysis conducted in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Final Report did not exclude ‘assets held by excepted persons’. Therefore, 85% of schemes delegate more than 29% of total assets. In the absence of additional evidence, we have used the above assumption as a proxy for the proportion of schemes who delegate more than 20% (or more) of assets (excluding excepted persons). Given the above, the estimated number of delegations that took place between 11 June and 9 December could be an over-estimate.&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:47" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
