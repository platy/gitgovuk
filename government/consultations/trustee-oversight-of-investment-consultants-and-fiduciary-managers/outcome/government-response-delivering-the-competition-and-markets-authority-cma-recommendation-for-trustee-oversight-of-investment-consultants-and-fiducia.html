<h2>Chapter 1: Summary</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1. Following a reference from the Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>) carried out an investigation into the provision of Investment Consultancy (<abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>) and Fiduciary Management (<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr>) services to pension schemes. In simple terms, investment consultancy is the provision of advice to trustees on investment strategy and related matters. Fiduciary management involves the delegation of some investment decisions by trustees to advisers alongside providing advice on investment related matters. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> provisional decision report was published in July 2018<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>2. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> provisionally found an adverse effect on competition and likely customer detriment for trustees, and in turn the employer sponsors of Defined Benefit (<abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr>) schemes and the members of Defined Contribution (<abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr>) schemes.  They proposed remedies to encourage better trustee engagement when buying both <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services, and better disclosure of fees and performance.</p>

<p>3. On 12 December 2018 the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> published its final report<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> on its market investigation. The report confirmed their findings that for both services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a low level of engagement by trustees;</li>
  <li>there is a lack of clear and comparable information to assess value for money; and</li>
  <li>customers are steered by consultants towards their own higher-cost fiduciary management services, giving them an incumbency advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>4. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is legally required to take such action as it considers to be reasonable and practicable to remedy, mitigate or prevent: the adverse effect on the competition concerned or any detrimental effects on consumers as a result<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. In this case, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has put in place an Order which was made on 10 June 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>  and has been fully in force since 10 December 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> report also made a number of recommendations to government (Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and Her Majestyâs Treasury (<abbr title="Her Majestyâs Treasury">HMT</abbr>)) and to regulators (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> and The Pensions Regulator (<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>)) to facilitate the implementation of the remedies (see Annex A (extract from <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> Final report, page 283)). The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> recommendation to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> was that it should make the necessary legislation to enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>, rather than the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, to oversee the duties on trustees.</p>

<h3>Government Response to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report</h3>

<p>6. The government produced a joint response<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="Her Majestyâs Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> which was published on 12 March 2019, accepting the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendations.</p>

<p>7. In the joint response, the government committed to taking forward the recommendations put to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to make the relevant legislation. This would bring the provisions of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order into pensions law for remedies one (mandatory competitive tendering of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services) and seven (setting objectives for their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services) and enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to oversee the new duties on trustees, rather than leave long term enforcement of a small aspect of the legislation applicable to occupational pension schemes to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> also accepted the recommendation to produce guidance to help trustees comply with the new procedures. The joint response also acknowledged that <abbr title="Her Majestyâs Treasury">HMT</abbr> would consider their recommendation and consult in due course on amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (<abbr title="Regulated Activities Order 2001">RAO</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>, in response to <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> recommendation to bring investment consultants within the remit of the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>9. The <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> were obliged by law to respond separately as they made the original <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> referral and their response<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> was published on 26 February 2019.  Their response confirmed that they supported bringing <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services into their regulatory remit and this would allow them to consult on rules to incorporate the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> remedies into <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>âs regulation of the sector.  Their response also confirmed that they would consult on introducing into the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> Handbook the relevant rules for firms offering fiduciary management services.</p>

<p>10. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> published its consultation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> on 29 July 2019 proposing the necessary changes to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 and the Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 2005. The consultation was published alongside a proposed draft of the legislation (then titled âThe Occupational Pension Schemes (Governance and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2019â<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> ) and the Impact Assessment<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>11. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> published their draft guidance to support the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> Order on 31 July 2019 for consultation. Their final guidance was published on 28 November 2019.</p>

<h3>Our Proposals</h3>

<p>12. We viewed the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> remedies (trustees setting objectives for investment consultants and the mandatory competitive tendering on first adoption of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> or the continuation of historic untendered <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr>) as a positive step for improving ongoing trustee engagement and likely to lead to consequential improvements in the value for money of <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services.</p>

<p>13. We therefore proposed to largely replicate, with some minor alterations based on slight policy differences, the relevant parts of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> Order in our legislation, along with the monitoring and compliance requirements to allow <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to act as the regulator in relation to these duties.</p>

<h3>Responses to the consultation</h3>

<p>14. The consultation on policy proposals and on proposed changes to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 and the Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 2005 was launched on the 29 July 2019 and ran until 2 September 2019.</p>

<p>15. We asked 9 questions on the policy proposals and draft regulations to bring the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order into pensions law for remedies one and seven. The questions asked in the consultation are attached at Annex B.  We received 22 formal responses to the consultation from a range of individuals and organisations (see Annex C).  The responses are detailed in Chapter 2. During the consultation, we conducted further engagement with stakeholders, including regulators, trustees, consultants, asset managers, law firms, actuaries and trade associations.</p>

<h3>Summary of changes</h3>

<p>16. This document sets out the governmentâs response to the consultation responses we received.  The government has considered all the responses we received when finalising the draft Regulations. This document also sets out the changes to our policy proposals and the rationale for these changes, along with changes being made to the draft Regulations.</p>

<p>17. As private pensions policy is reserved in Wales and Scotland, the consultation, and this response, applies to Great Britain.  Private pensions policy is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Government Response</h2>

<p>18. This chapter sets out the governmentâs response, following the consultation on taking forward the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendations and proposals from their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> Market Investigation final report published on 12 December 2018.</p>

<h2>Timing of the Legislation</h2>

<p>19. Subject to Parliamentary approval, we anticipate that our Regulations will come into force on 1 October 2022. This is a delay from our original coming into force date proposed at consultation. This is as a result of reprioritisation brought on by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>20. The draft Regulations will have been laid before Parliament at the time of publication of this consultation response and are subject to the affirmative procedure. This means that they can only be made with the approval of Parliament. There will be an interval of at least 3 months between the Regulations being laid in draft and their coming into force. This is so that any differences in the duties for trustees (although relatively minor) from those dictated by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order are publicised through this consultation response, the draft Regulations and the Impact Assessment which are published alongside it.  This will give trustees and other interested parties time to take account of the differences.  Additionally, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will be updating their published guidance to reflect the final regulations ahead of commencement.</p>

<p>21. Trustees are already complying with the requirements of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order which has been in force from 10 December 2019.  The Regulations will replace parts 3 and 7, and parts 9 to 11 as they relate to parts 3 and 7, of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, with some variations as outlined in the original consultation.</p>

<h2>Schemes in Scope</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>22. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order makes clear that all registrable <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> occupational pension schemes with 2 or more members are in scope of both remedies 1 and 7 other than those mentioned in Article 1.6 of the Order. Schemes mentioned in that Article include schemes which are not registrable schemes (see section 59 of the Pensions Act 2004) and public service pension schemes falling within the definition in section 318 of the Pensions Act 2004 (other than the local government pension scheme (<abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr>).</p>

<p>23. Our consultation and draft regulations proposed not to exclude public service pension schemes (<abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr>) defined by the Pensions Act 2004 (the 2004 Act), but instead limit scope to schemes with trustees. As <abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr> established under the 2004 Act are statutory schemes, they do not have trustees. Additionally, our regulations exclude all schemes which meet the <abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr> definition in the Pension Schemes Act 1993.</p>

<p>24. We did not propose to make any provision in respect of the <abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr>, as regulations and guidance in relation to the <abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr> are a matter for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>).</p>

<p>25. In addition, where the trustees of a pension scheme are contracting authorities for the purposes of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015, appointments which they make following a procurement exercise under those Regulations are not caught by remedy one under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. We have maintained that position.</p>

<p>26. Finally, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order also excluded certain other types of scheme from both remedies 1 and 7. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schemes where the principal or controlling employer of a scheme is themselves a provider of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services to the schemes</li>
  <li>defined contribution (<abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr>) master trusts for which an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> firm (or an interconnected body corporate of the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> firm) is the scheme strategist or scheme funder</li>
</ul>

<p>27. As our consultation outlined, we agreed that it would be impractical in these circumstances to expect the scheme trustees to carry out a competitive tender for <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services when they would have a clear and legitimate preference to use the services of the sponsoring employer. However, we believed it was reasonable for the trustee to set their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> objectives and monitor performance against them, regardless of whether the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> is connected with the sponsoring employer of the scheme. This is because the member could still potentially suffer detriment if this is not done. Therefore, these schemes are not excluded from remedy 7 and trustees of these schemes should set objectives for their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>.</p>

<p>28. We proposed not to make any changes to the treatment of schemes whose trustees own a provider of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services. Such schemes would remain out of scope of both remedies 1 and 7.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>29. There was broad support that there should be no size limit to schemes within the scope of this legislation.  A couple of respondents had concerns about the additional governance burden for small schemes or that the regulations may not lead to smaller firms entering the market.</p>

<p>30. One respondent suggested that <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> sponsored âDefined Benefit master trustâ type schemes could be excluded from the requirement to tender for the same reasons as <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> master trusts.</p>

<p>âIs the policy intent that commercial <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> master trusts are excluded from the requirements? In other words if the âproviderâ of the master trust is also the investment adviser or manager. If so we think it would be helpful for the Draft Regulations to make this clearer (in the same way that the Draft Regulations refer to <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> master trusts as defined in the Pension Schemes Act 2017)â Association of Pension Lawyers (<abbr title="Association of Pension Lawyers">APL</abbr>)</p>

<p>31. A further comment was that one of the categories of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providers that they thought should be caught by the excepted person exclusion, is the type of in-house investment consultant/fund manager which are established by the trustee for the benefit of the scheme alone â and often known as Occupational Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> firms.</p>

<p>ââ¦.we understand that the policy intention is that they (<abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr> Firms) should be excluded but that the vagaries of the structures adds only uncertainty. For that reason, we wonder whether an Excepted Person should explicitly include a reference to an <abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr> Firm to provide clarity and certainty.â Association of Pension Lawyers (<abbr title="Association of Pension Lawyers">APL</abbr>)</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>32. As stated in the consultation document, the regulations will apply to all the Pension Scheme Trustees of Occupational Pension Schemes, subject to the limited set of exemptions as set out in the background to this section above.</p>

<p>33. We have made clarificatory amendments to the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations, as detailed in the box below, to ensure that the legislation aligns with Article 3.6 and Article 4.4 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order (appointments by trustees who are  contracting authorities for the purposes of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015) as stated in paragraph 26 above.</p>

<p>34. Whilst we acknowledge the concerns raised about the governance burdens for small schemes, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> investigation concluded that they found the levels of engagement in investment consultancy vary considerably across different types of pension schemes and small schemes and <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes are less engaged in this market based on a number of indicators.  They concluded therefore that the burden on small schemes in addressing the adverse effects on competition was proportionate.  We accepted the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> recommendation and did not consult on this point.</p>

<p>35. It is important that all relevant schemes address the adverse effect on competition (<abbr title="adverse effect on competition">AEC</abbr>) identified by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> and that all members of these schemes are receiving value for money from their investments.</p>

<p>36. On â<abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Master trustsâ, we have not provided an exemption for defined benefit âmaster trustsâ which are provided by <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> firms from the requirement to tender for <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services. This is because this type of scheme (<abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> master trust) was not prominent in the market and not considered as part of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> investigation, so we do not have any evidence of an adverse effect on competition and were thus not excluded from the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<p>37. Having carefully considered the responses, we have concluded that the following additional amendments should be made to the scope of the regulations as consulted on, as set out below.</p>

<h4>Out of scope (from <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> definition) investment managers co-owned by trustees (Trustee Owned Companies)</h4>

<p>38. One of the categories of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> Providers intended to be caught by the excepted person exclusion in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order is the type of in-house fund manager/investment consultant established by the trustee for the benefit of the scheme alone - often known as an â<abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr> Firmâ.</p>

<p>39. A number of large occupational pension schemes have established their own â<abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr> Firms<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>â  to whom the trustees of the scheme then delegate their investment management functions in accordance with sections 34 and 36 of the Pensions Act 1995. These <abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr> Firms are in-house authorised firms which can carry on a number of regulated activities - including managing investments and providing advice - whilst benefitting from a lighter-touch <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> regime because they can only provide their services to the pension scheme(s) that have established them.</p>

<p>40. The <abbr title="Association of Pension Lawyers">APL</abbr> raised concerns about the definition of âtrustee owned companyâ in the consultation draft of the Regulations.  The concerns flowed from the requirement that to be a trustee owned company it would have to be wholly owned by trustees of one particular pension scheme.</p>

<p>41. However, we do not want to exclude <abbr title="Occupational Pension Scheme">OPS</abbr> firms by definition as we believe this in itself could be subject to an avoidance risk.  We have therefore revised the definition of âtrustee owned companyâ used in the new provisions to capture not only those companies which are wholly owned by the trustees of a single occupational pension scheme, but also companies which are wholly owned by the trustees of several different occupational pension schemes or the trustees of one or more such pension schemes together with one or more companies which themselves fall within the definition of âtrustee owned companyâ.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Clarificatory amendments to paragraph 8 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations (as inserted by the draft Regulations) to ensure that the Schedule is aligned with Article 3.6 and Article 4.4 of the CMA Order (appointments by trustees who are contracting authorities for the purposes of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015).</p>

<p>We have amended the definition of âtrustee owned companyâ in new regulation 31(2) of the 1996 Regulations (as inserted by the draft Regulations) so that companies which are owned by the trustees of several different occupational pension schemes are within scope of that definition.</p>
</div>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>42. We explained in our consultation document that there were no set definitions in pensions law for <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services and <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services. It is important that trustees, the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> markets and wider pensions industry have a joint understanding of what is meant by these services and therefore proposed definitions of both services were included in the draft Regulations.</p>

<p>43. Although the definitions closely followed those definitions set out in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, we proposed making some relatively minor changes to align terminology with existing pensions legislation and simplify drafting in a small number of places.</p>

<h3>Investment Consultancy Services</h3>

<p>44. With regards to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> definition of advice (below), the drafting in the consultation version of the regulations (new regulation 36(3) and (4) of the 1996 Regulations), was provided to support the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> definition of advice (in Article 2.1 of the Order).</p>

<p>âThe reference to âadvisesâ means the provision of advice on the merits of the Pension Scheme Trustees taking or not taking a specific course of action and includes, [but is not limited to] a recommendation or guidance to that effect.â</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<h4>Widening the definition</h4>

<p>45. Some of the consultation responses commented on the differences between our definition of <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services compared to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr>.</p>

<p>âThe <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order contains a reference to advice being on the merits of âtaking or not taking a specific course of action and includes a recommendation or guidance to that effect.â We note this language has been removed from the Draft Regulations, the effect of which is to make the definition of advice significantly broader than the definition in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. This not only creates inconsistencies in the interpretation of advice and <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> and <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services, but most importantly has the effect of materially widening the scope of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> and <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services, thereby resulting in overly complex, burdensome and unwarranted obligations falling on both firms and trustees.â Investment Association</p>

<p>âIn our view, a definition of investment consultancy services more in line with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>âs Order, is required to provide more certainty for the trustees and providers, which does not refer to investment strategy and includes the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>âs helpful definition of adviceâ. Mercer</p>

<h4>Exemption of high-level commentary provided by an Actuary</h4>

<p>46. Responses to our consultation strongly contested the removal of the exemption from the definition of investment consultancy, for the âhigh level commentaryâ provided by an actuary in an actuarial valuation.â</p>

<p>âIt is vitally important to understand that actuaries provide such comments within the scope of their ordinary advice to assist their clients in understanding the interaction between assets and funding or other actuarial matters, but without directly advising clients on what assets to hold or not to hold, in other words: without providing investment advice.â   Barnett Waddingham LLP</p>

<p>âWe do not agree with the proposed removal from the definition of âInvestment Consultancy Servicesâ of the explicit exemption for high level commentary by the scheme actuary. We think the position would be clearer if the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>âs exemption wording was replicated in the regulations.â Aon</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<h4>Widening of the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> definition</h4>

<p>47. For greater consistency with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, we have inserted an additional provision in  new regulation 31 of the 1996 Regulations to make it clear that it does not matter, for the purposes of Part 6 of the 1996 Regulations, whether advice is given in a recommendation or in guidance or otherwise (see new regulation 36(6)(b)).</p>

<p>48. As highlighted above, comments were also received in relation to regulation 35(3)(a)(i)(ee) of the consultation draft of the Regulations where we proposed to include advice on investment strategy in the definition of â<abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> servicesâ.  We have not removed the reference to investment strategy from that definition as it is our view that when advice is being given by an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider about anything that is investment related, then it is pertinent to set objectives in respect of what that advice will deliver.  It is our view that this approach is consistent with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order (see in particular, paragraph 23 of the Explanatory Note to the Order which states âthe [investment consultancy] services may also include (but do not have to include) advice in relation to investment strategy or the appointment of a Fiduciary Management Providerâ).</p>

<p>49. More generally, we have, in response to the comments on the definition of â<abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> servicesâ, also made a number of amendments to the definition of â<abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> servicesâ for the purposes of the Regulations so it more closely aligns with the definition in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. We believe that this will offer valuable reassurance to trustees who are concerned that the definition of advice is too broad. This also avoids the risk of deviation in intent between the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and our Regulations, something stakeholders called for.</p>

<h4>Exemption for high level commentary given by an actuary</h4>

<p>50. With regards to the exemption for high level commentary provided by actuaries in actuarial valuations, we have, in response to stakeholder comments, added a provision to the Regulations to make clear that the provision of such commentary is not by itself the provision of âinvestment consultancy servicesâ.</p>

<p>51. However, we do understand that some actuaries might provide both actuarial advice and investment consultancy services to the same pension scheme trustees.  That is not to say that a natural part of the role of a scheme actuary or actuarial advisor is to advise on investment decisions, rather it is an additional and sometimes complementary service that is being provided by those individuals or firms to those trustees.</p>

<p>52. Where an actuary also provides services which are investment consultancy services to the trustees of an occupational pension scheme in scope of the Regulations, those trustees must set objectives for that person in relation to the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services which they provide, and review those objectives, as required by the Regulations. It should be clear to trustees and actuaries when they have self-evidently gone past the scope of âhigh level commentaryâ and are therefore providing advice which meets the definition of investment consultancy services in our regulations, irrespective of the capacity in which they report offering it.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have made amendments to the definition of âinvestment consultancy servicesâ to align more closely with the definition of those services in the CMA Order (new regulation 34 of the 1996 Regulations).</p>

<p>We have added a provision to the regulations to make clear that the high-level commentary provided by an actuary in an actuarial valuation is not itself a service falling within the definition of âinvestment consultancy servicesâ (new regulation 34(4) of the 1996 Regulations).</p>
</div>

<h3>Fiduciary Management Services</h3>

<p>53. In the section of the draft regulations that described the meaning of â<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providerâ we included a condition to set out that a provider is also considered to provide an <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> service (<abbr title="Financial Management service">FMS</abbr>) where (subject to other conditions in the regulations) they are appointed to carry out asset management, up to 12 months prior to being appointed to provide <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> [services].  This was to ensure that the regulations provide clarity by covering all appointment scenarios or sequences and avoid any potential misunderstandings or loopholes.</p>

<p>54. We also sought to define an <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> provider in regulations via a two-element approach, describing this in regulations as investment consultancy + asset management = fiduciary management.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>55. The responses to the consultation highlighted a number of differences in the proposed definition of âfiduciary management servicesâ for the purposes of the Regulations when compared to the definition used in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. In addition, respondents also commented on the following 2 issues.</p>

<h4>Transition management arrangements</h4>

<p>56. This term describes a situation where the trustees delegate authority - sometimes to their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> - just for a short period to move assets in their current portfolio to another arrangement and replace/remove the current manager.  Stakeholders expressed the view that it would not be appropriate to tender every time they want to adjust their portfolio.</p>

<p>âWe are concerned that the definition of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> as drafted could unintentionally include other services. In particular, where trustees outsource the transition of assets when making portfolio changes. They may delegate authority to their consultant, but it would not be appropriate to have to tender every time they want to move assets in their portfolio. A possible solution would be to reference the duration of the appointment/project with short term exercises being excluded.â Aon</p>

<p>ââ¦the definition would seem to catch a transition management arrangement in which trustees temporarily delegate certain of their investment discretions to the trusteesâ investment consultant for the purpose of transitioning the schemeâs investments from one fund manager to another. It is not clear to us whether this reflects the policy intention, which we understand to be to treat ongoing delegated investment relationships (rather than temporary or ad hoc arrangements) as being subject to the requirements.â Travers Smith LLP</p>

<h4>Asset Managers subsequently delivering <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>
</h4>

<p>57. One stakeholder suggested that the proposed definition of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services did not capture, contrary to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, the situation where an Asset Manager (<abbr title="Asset Manager">AM</abbr>) (who has been appointed for 12 months or longer) begins to give investment consultancy advice.</p>

<p>âWe have some concerns the definition of fiduciary management does not capture the situation where an asset manager (who has been appointed for 12 months or longer) begins to give investment consultancy advice. The resulting combined service is indistinguishable from fiduciary management. In our experience, this situation is fairly common.â Lane Clark &amp; Peacock LLP</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>58. We have made a number of amendments to the definition of âfiduciary management servicesâ for the purposes of the Regulations, taking account of the points raised above, so that the definition is more closely aligned with the definition in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<h4>Transition Management</h4>

<p>59. On transition management arrangements, we have considered the issue raised regarding the short-term delegation by trustees to their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> for the transition of assets during portfolio changes and replacement/removal of managers.  We agree that carrying out such a specific transition service should not be within the scope of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services.</p>

<p>60. We have, therefore, amended the Regulations to make clear that carrying out transition management services alone will not mean that a person is a fiduciary management provider for the purposes of the Regulations (see new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations, paragraph 3(6)).</p>

<h4>Asset Managers subsequently delivering <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> Advice</h4>

<p>61. With reference to asset managers who provide advice after they are appointed as a manager, we agree that such a person should be a fiduciary management provider for the purposes of the Regulations irrespective of whether the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services are provided within the first 12 months of their appointment as asset manager. We have therefore updated the draft Regulations to remove the time limit of âwithin 12 months beginning on the appointment dateâ of the asset manager being appointed. This will also align with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have amended paragraph 3 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to align the definition of FM services more closely with the definition of FM services in the CMA Order. In particular:</p>

<p>We excluded âtransition managementâ from the scope of FM services (see paragraph 3(6) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations);</p>

<p>We amended paragraph 3(8)(a)(iii) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations so there is no longer a requirement that the relevant advice has been provided within 12 months of the person being appointed to manage a schemeâs assets.</p>
</div>

<h2>Group Undertaking</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>62. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order provides for persons to be regarded as connected where they are interconnected bodies corporate, or in a partnership or participating in a joint venture. They used these specific connections to identify whether a scheme was sponsored by an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> or connected body, or a service met the definition of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr>.</p>

<p>63. Our proposal was to use âgroup undertakingâ to capture the full range of relationships which determine whether or not persons were to be regarded as connected for the purposes of our Regulations. The difference between the definitions of group undertaking and the interconnected body corporate lies in the kinds of bodies which are interconnected. Interconnected body corporate does not capture partnerships or unincorporated associations. So, if a partnership or an unincorporated association were the parent of a body corporate, the 2 would form a group undertaking but not an interconnected body corporate. Interconnected body corporate is therefore a subset of group undertaking.</p>

<p>64. Unlike the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, however, we did not propose to make provision which allowed bodies to be treated as connected if they are participating in the same joint venture. This meant that we did not propose to treat an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider participating in a joint venture with an <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> provider as an â<abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> firmâ (and so if that <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider is the scheme sponsor or scheme strategist of a <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> Master Trust scheme, they would remain within scope of remedy 7) and also that connection via a joint venture would not be sufficient to exempt the provision of services by certain persons from the definition of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services.</p>

<p>65. This approach was taken because a joint venture does not signify the same level of ownership and control, given that control will be shared with one or more other undertakings.  We also believe that there could be an avoidance risk, so that where a scheme sponsor and an <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> had a joint venture, they would not be required to run, or bid for, a competitive tender. This could inadvertently incentivise firms to create joint ventures to circumvent this duty. We therefore intended that where sponsors and FMs are connected via a joint venture, there should still be a requirement to run a competitive tender.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>66. There was broad support for the policy proposal from all respondents.</p>

<p>âWe agree that the proposal to use group undertakings in the context of the proposed regulatory changes is sensible as it captures a broader range of ownership and control structures between scheme sponsors and ICs/FMs.â EY</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>67. We note the support for the use of group undertaking for the purposes of determining whether bodies are connected to each other and do not intend to make any changes to the policy described above.</p>

<p>68. However, we have made some changes to our definition of âfiduciary management servicesâ to make clear that an asset manager who is connected to an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider via a joint venture can be an <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> provider for the purposes of our Regulations.  This change is made to clarify and put beyond doubt the original policy position, as set out in the consultation document, that such a connection alone would not be sufficient to mean that a person could benefit from any of the âconnected personâ exemptions in the Regulations. The updated definition makes it clear that where an asset manager and a provider of investment consultancy services are connected via a joint venture, the asset manager can be a fiduciary management provider and the duty to tender for the provision of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services can apply.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have made amendments to our definition of FM services at paragraph 3(8) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to make clear that an asset manager who is connected to an IC provider via a joint venture can be an FM provider.</p>
</div>

<h2>Mandatory tendering for fiduciary management</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>69. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order sets out the circumstances under which the trustees are required to carry out a competitive tender process.  This was outlined in the historic and ongoing tests and both tests need to be considered by trustees before deciding whether the competitive tender process is necessary. Our regulations refer to this process as a âQualifying Tender Processâ.</p>

<p>70. Our proposals only excluded buy-in policies from the calculation of assets, whereas the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order Explanatory Note sets out that the assets of the scheme are the funds held by the trustees of the scheme, excluding any asset-backed contribution (<abbr title="asset-backed contribution">ABC</abbr>) arrangements.</p>

<p>71. Our proposals also confirmed that, as with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, for sectionalised pension schemes the 20% threshold is calculated from the whole of the scheme not a section of the scheme.</p>

<p>72. We made small changes to drafting to make clear that the service remains <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr>, even if no advice has been given in the past 12 months.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<h4>Asset Backed Contributions (<abbr title="asset-backed contributions">ABCs</abbr>)</h4>

<p>73. Several stakeholders suggested that our regulations should be aligned with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order in excluding <abbr title="asset-backed contributions">ABCs</abbr> from the âmanageable assetsâ of a scheme.  The majority of comments were around the valuation of such assets.</p>

<p>âWe believe the decision to include asset-backed contribution (<abbr title="asset-backed contribution">ABC</abbr>) structures in the definition of manageable assets of a scheme could result in difficulties when putting the regulations into practice, due to the subjective nature of any valuation of an <abbr title="asset-backed contribution">ABC</abbr> structure. As such, we believe <abbr title="asset-backed contributions">ABCs</abbr> should be excluded to make valuations more straight-forward for schemes.â PLSA</p>

<h4>Sectionalised Schemes</h4>

<p>74. A small number of stakeholders commented on our proposal that for sectionalised schemes, the 20% test is calculated from [taking account of] the whole of the scheme, not a section of the scheme.</p>

<p>âIt is unclear to us why the 20% threshold should be tested only at scheme level and not also at section level if a scheme consists of multiple legally fully segregated sections. Imagine that one section had assets worth 19% of the whole scheme. The entirety of the assets of that section could be entrusted to fiduciary managers without breaching the 20% threshold.â SPP</p>

<p>âWe welcome <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>âs clarification that the 20% threshold for sectionalised schemes will be calculated for the whole of the scheme and although out of scope for this specific consultation, we believe it worthwhile emphasising here that it would be helpful to schemes if this decision was reflected in <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPRâs</abbr> accompanying guidanceâ PLSA</p>

<h4>Ongoing tendering requirement</h4>

<p>75. One stakeholder pointed out that the duty in our regulations to carry out a qualifying tender for new and existing <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> provider appointments would not apply where a scheme appoints or re-appoints a fiduciary manager after this first occasion on which the threshold is exceeded.</p>

<p>âThe reference to the asset management threshold being met âfor the first timeâ under paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Schedule means that the duty to carry out a qualifying tender exercise would not apply where a scheme appoints or re-appoints a fiduciary manager after the first occasion on which the threshold is exceeded.</p>

<p>We would expect the requirement to carry out a qualifying tender process to apply to all <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> appointments made, and new mandates entered into, on or after 6 April 2020 where the 20% threshold is met (unless an exception applies). However, based on our reading of the draft Regulations, they do not currently achieve this.â</p>

<h4>Lacuna period</h4>

<p>76. Article 4 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order tests whether the 20% threshold was met on 10 June 2019. In our consultation, the equivalent provision in our draft Regulations tested whether that threshold was met immediately before the Regulations come into force.   Some stakeholders identified scenarios where schemes could have a different status under Article 4 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and under our Regulations.  One stakeholder also identified a lacuna in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order which meant that where a scheme met or crossed the 20% threshold between 11 June and 9 December 2019 would not be captured by Article 4 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.  It was noted that the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations had closed this loophole.</p>

<p>âWe note that the obligation under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order to run a competitive tender process for fiduciary management appointments comes into force on 10 December 2019. We also note that the provision in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order relating to running a competitive tender for existing fiduciary management appointments applies to appointments entered into before 10 June 2019.  Consequently, there appears to be a lacuna in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order in respect of fiduciary management appointments entered into between 10 June 2019 and 10 December 2019.  We note that this lacuna in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order appears to be addressed by the Draft Regulations as currently draftedâ¦.â Travers Smith LLP</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<h4>Asset Backed Contributions</h4>

<p>77. In the case of <abbr title="asset-backed contributions">ABCs</abbr>, having carefully considered the views of stakeholders, and because management of these assets cannot be delegated, we have concluded that they will be excluded from scope of the calculation of assets.   We have made an amendment to the meaning of âmanageable assetsâ for the purposes of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to make clear that both <abbr title="asset-backed contributions">ABCs</abbr> and buy-in policies are not to be taken into account when working out if the asset management threshold is or would be met (see new paragraph 3(5) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations).</p>

<h4>Sectionalised schemes</h4>

<p>78. We will maintain the policy position set out at the time of the consultation on sectionalised schemes and continue in line with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> approach of calculating the 20% test from the assets of the whole scheme.  Trustees are responsible for the whole scheme and we want to encourage them to engage with the <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> appointment process, in line with the 20% test and the adverse effect on competition found by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Ongoing tendering requirement</h4>

<p>79. We have made amendments to the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to ensure, as was the intention at the time of the original consultation, that our Regulations do in fact align with the tendering requirements imposed by Articles 3 and 4 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<p>80. These amendments are intended to ensure that the ongoing nature of the duties in Article 3 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order is replicated in our legislation. In particular that the relevant requirements to carry out a competitive tender process will not apply only when a scheme first meets or exceeds the asset management threshold after the Regulations come into force, but also each time it subsequently meets or exceeds that threshold, due to intended amendment to the contractual assets under management,  having previously fallen below it (see Part 3 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations).</p>

<p>81. In addition, we have amended paragraph 9 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to make clear that the duties in that paragraph apply each time the trustees are required to carry out a tender under paragraph 8 of the new Schedule. The duty in paragraph 9 will not apply in respect of any <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providers who were appointed following a competitive tender process under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, a qualifying tender process under our Regulations or a procurement exercise under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015.</p>

<p>82. We have also amended the provisions in Part 2 of that Schedule (which give effect to Article 4 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order) to make clear that trustees do not have to carry out a qualifying tender under that Part where their scheme falls below and remains below the asset management threshold (see new paragraph 7(2)(a) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations).</p>

<p>83. We have also updated the deadline by which the requirements in paragraph 7 in Part 2 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations must be complied with by schemes currently caught by Article 4.2 or 4.3 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. These amendments are necessary to take account of the fact that our Regulations will now come into force after the expiry of the period set out in Article 4.3 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and may come into force after the period in Article 4.2 has already expired for some schemes.  Schemes to which Article 4.2 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order currently applies will in effect have the remainder of any grace period under that provision to complete the tendering process for the purposes of our Regulations. Where the trustees of a scheme have started a competitive tender process under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order before our Regulations come into force and complete the process within the remainder of the grace period, they will be treated as having complied with the duty in paragraph 7(1) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations.  Schemes which have completed a competitive tender process in accordance with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order before our Regulations come into force will not be required to carry out a further tender under this paragraph. However, provision is made to allow <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to take action if the trustees of any of those schemes have still not completed a tendering process by the end of the day on which these Regulations come into force.</p>

<h4>Lacuna period</h4>

<p>84. In relation to the âloopholeâ in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, this arises because certain tests in Article 4 of the Order are tied to the date on which the Order was made, rather than when it comes into force.  As already confirmed, this loophole was closed by the consultation draft and we have made a policy decision to retain that position (see paragraph 6(1)(a) and (3) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations).</p>

<p>85. These schemes, together with any others which meet the asset management threshold immediately before the Regulations come into force and not caught by Article 4.2 or 4.3 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, will have a similar period of time to complete their tender process as schemes currently caught by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<h4>Other Amendments</h4>

<p>86. Article 1.6(f) and 1.7 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order make clear that certain providers of fiduciary management services (including trustees of the scheme or trustee owned companies and controlling employers) are outside of the scope of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, along with the assets which are being managed by those persons.   However, the effect of these provisions was not fully reflected in the consultation draft of the Regulations â in particular, the calculation of the asset management threshold did not allow for assets being managed (or proposed to be managed) by these excepted persons to be disregarded and we had not excluded from our definition of â<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providerâ a person who is providing asset management services but is connected to an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider who is an excepted person.</p>

<p>87. We have updated the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to make clear that assets being managed by the persons mentioned in Article 1.6(f) or 1.7 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order are to be disregarded when determining whether a scheme meets or will meet the asset management threshold (see new paragraph 4 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations, which sets out how the asset management threshold is to be calculated and defines âin-scope assetsâ. Paragraph 3 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations defines âin-scope <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providerâ and âout-of-scope <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providerâ, and paragraph 2 of the new Schedule defines âexcepted personâ).</p>

<p>88. We have also updated the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to make clear that the duties in that Schedule apply only in relation to the appointment of, or changes to the mandates of, <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providers who are not excepted persons, and that the duties do not apply to persons who would be <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providers only because of a connection to an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider who is an excepted person (see the new definition of âin-scope <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providerâ in paragraph 3(11) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations and also changes made throughout the new Schedule to make clear that the new duties only arise in relation to the appointment etc. of such in-scope providers).</p>

<p>89. These amendments were considered necessary to bring our regulations in line with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Orderâs approach to the assets under management which count towards the 20% threshold for tendering.</p>

<p>90. We have also made a minor change to paragraph 3(9) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to ensure that the advice limb of the definition of â<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> providerâ is more closely aligned with the corresponding provision in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have revised the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations as follows:</p>

<p>We have made an amendment to the meaning of âmanageable assetsâ for the purposes of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to make clear that both ABCs and buy-in policies are not to be taken into account when working out if the asset management threshold is or would be met (see new paragraph 3(5) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations).</p>

<p>To ensure that our Regulations align with the tendering requirements imposed by Articles 3 and 4 of the CMA Order, we have updated paragraphs 7 to 10 of the new Schedule to the 1996 Order. For similar reasons changes have been made to the definition provisions in paragraph 3 of the Schedule and to the manner in which the asset management threshold is to be calculated.</p>

<p>A change to paragraph 3(9) of the new Schedule to the 1996 Regulations to ensure that the advice limb of the definition of âFM providerâ is more closely aligned with the corresponding provision in the CMA Order.</p>
</div>

<h2>Setting objectives for Investment Consultants</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>91. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report set out its remedies for improving the investment consultancy services received by customers.  The aim is that pension scheme trustees better monitor the performance of their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider by setting and measuring them against an appropriate set of strategic objectives. Trustees must not enter into an agreement for the provision of <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services unless strategic objectives have been set for the provider.</p>

<p>92. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> measure applies to anyone providing a service which meets the proposed legal definition of investment consultancy, whether that service is described or promoted as being investment consultancy. Where a scheme engages with its actuary, or an independent financial adviser or any other person providing services meeting this definition, it will be subject to the objective setting requirements.</p>

<p>93. We largely replicated this in our proposals, only making changes in some aspects so that the measure sits better with existing pensions legislation. We referred to âobjectivesâ rather than âstrategic objectivesâ to avoid the unintended perception that only objectives relating to investment strategy should be included.</p>

<p>94. We did not, however, intend that advice from the scheme lawyer(s) on investment matters is considered as <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> and therefore we have specifically excluded from our regulations the duty for trustees to set objectives for them.</p>

<p>95. Our proposal set out that we expected trustees to:</p>

<p>a)	set objectives for their investment consultancy service that have regard to the statement of investment principles,</p>

<p>b)	review the performance of each <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider against their objectives at least every 12 months, and</p>

<p>c)	review the objectives at least every 3 years and without delay after any significant change in investment policy</p>

<p>96. We have not made provision in law, but we expect that objectives:</p>

<p>(a)	include a clear definition of the outcome expected to be delivered and the timescale over which it will be delivered,</p>

<p>(b)	should be relevant to the services provided,</p>

<p>(c)	should also enable the trustee to measure the performance of the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> services provided</p>

<p>97. Where trustees have existing arrangements with ICs which pre-date the coming into force of these regulations for which they have not yet set objectives, our draft legislation proposed that they should set objectives with immediate effect.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>98. There was generally broad support for our proposals around setting objectives for <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> providers.</p>

<p>99. Most of the stakeholders who responded on this aspect were supportive of our proposal for trustees to set âobjectivesâ:</p>

<p>âYes, we are supportive of the requirement to set objectives, including making them broader than âstrategic objectivesâ as originally envisaged in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.â Buck</p>

<p>100. A couple of stakeholders commented about the requirement for trustees to review the performance of their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> every 12 months:</p>

<p>âAlso, we think that for some of our clients it may not be practical for Trustees to review the performance of their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider every 12 months. For smaller schemes, in particular, it will be quite onerous to go through that process when they may only have 1 meeting per year with their Investment Consultant.â  First Actuarial LLP</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>101. Whilst we acknowledge that smaller schemes may have less opportunity to engage with their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> provider, we do not intend to make any changes to the policy set out in our proposals.  In line with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and the adverse effect on competition found by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, it is important that all trustees review the performance of their <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> to ensure value for money for the scheme members.</p>

<p>102. The draft regulations envisaged the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> objectives as being set at commencement even where objectives were set separately under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.  To ensure that the requirement to review the objectives at least every 3 years and without delay after any significant change in investment policy does not inadvertently become extended, we have amended new regulation 35(4).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have made an amendment to regulation 35(4) to ensure that the review period for objectives set under the CMA Order does not extend beyond 3 years.</p>
</div>

<h2>Reporting Compliance</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>103. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> Order requires pension scheme trustees to submit compliance statements to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> confirming the extent to which they had complied with the articles of parts 3 and 7 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order which were in force during the reporting period.</p>

<p>104. Our regulations will enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to oversee the remedies that apply to trustees and for them to carry out the appropriate monitoring, compliance and enforcement activity. Trustees will be required, within the existing scheme return process, to report compliance in relation to the new requirements outlined in the legislation.</p>

<p>105. Amendments to the Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 2005<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup> (âthe Registration Regulationsâ), will require <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to ask additional questions on the scheme returns for trustees to complete.  This gives opportunity for schemes to certify compliance or non-compliance and to provide <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> with intelligence which it may be beneficial to investigate further.  Our proposals in the consultation set out the details of what the scheme returns will include.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>106. There was broad support for our proposals in connection with the compliance process.</p>

<p>âYes, we agree with the introduction of specific requirements on the format of the registrable information which will allow <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to monitor and carry out compliance.â EY</p>

<p>107. One stakeholder noticed an error in the draft regulations.</p>

<p>âThe new paragraph 3(A) in Part 3 (Registrable Information) should, we believe, reference ââ¦ Part 6 of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 (âthe 1996 Regulationsâ).</p>

<p>âIn Part 3 (Schemes at or above the asset management threshold), at paragraph 12.(2), we believe the cross-reference should be to sub-paragraph (1) and not sub-paragraph (2).â Mercer</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>108. In terms of information and guidance on the compliance processes, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will be providing this for trustees ahead of commencement of the regulations.</p>

<p>109. We have agreed two amendments to the regulations. The first to correct an error in regulation 3C(e) in Part 3 (Registrable Information) to clarify that this should read âwhether trustees have reviewed the performance of the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr> providerâ¦â not the service.</p>

<p>110. The second is to amend the new paragraph 3B in Part 3 (Registrable Information) which should reference ââ¦ Part 6 of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 (âthe 1996 Regulationsâ).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have made 2 amendments to our regulations concerning the new registrable information requirements:</p>

<p>To correct an error in new regulation 3D(e) of the Registration Regulationsâ to clarify that this should have read âwhether trustees have reviewed the performance of the IC providerâ¦..â not the service.</p>

<p>To amend new regulation 3B of the Registration Regulations which should reference ââ¦ Part 6 of the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 .</p>
</div>

<h2>Penalties</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>111. Our consultation document sets out that the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMAâs</abbr> approach is to give directions in writing for the purposes of carrying out, or ensuring compliance with, their Order and that they may vary or revoke any directions so given.</p>

<p>112. Our regulations set out our approach to using a discretionary regime of compliance notices and penalties. This process is similar to the compliance provisions already required for the automatic enrolment charges measures which <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> trustees will already be familiar with.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>113. A minority of respondents commented on this section of our proposals. Again, these queries were around the practicalities of the penalty process.</p>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>114. We do not propose to make any amendments to the regulations for our penalty proposals. Guidance provided by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will be issued once the regulations are made.</p>

<h2>Impacts</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>115. An Impact Assessment (<abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr>) estimating the direct and indirect costs to business and others was published alongside the consultation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order was used as the counterfactual, therefore only impacts that arise above and beyond the Order contribute to the Equivalent Annual Net Direct Cost to Business (<abbr title="Equivalent Annual Net Direct Cost to Business">EANDCB</abbr>).</p>

<p>We specifically asked for evidence of:</p>

<h4>(a) Competitive tender:</h4>

<p>Our assumptions about the use of group undertaking rather than interconnected body corporate to determine whether fiduciary managers (FMs) are independent of one another and therefore able to compete. We did not know precisely how many organisations would be impacted by this policy change. We assumed trustees would avoid more than one approach to firms which formed a group undertaking and would instead seek a different tender.</p>

<h4>(b) Definition of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> Services:</h4>

<p>Our assumptions around changing the references in the definition to group undertaking rather than interconnected body corporate, and services therefore falling into scope of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr>. We did not know precisely how many organisations would be impacted by this policy change. We assumed the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> captured all such schemes and that no firms are impacted by the change in the definition of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services.</p>

<h4>(c) Schemes where the principal or controlling employer of a scheme is themselves a provider of <abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> services, and Master Trusts for which an <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> firm (or a group undertaking of the <abbr title="Investment Consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="Fiduciary Management">FM</abbr> firm) is the scheme strategist or scheme funder:</h4>

<p>Our assumptions around the number of schemes impacted and therefore required to set and monitor objectives.</p>

<h4>(d) Compliance reporting:</h4>

<p>Our assumptions around the resources to compile the information and complete the questions in the scheme return.</p>

<h3>Stakeholder responses</h3>

<p>116.	We received 4 responses on the <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr> which can be categorised into 6 themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr> did not fully consider the costs of compliance for schemes outside the scope of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order but in scope of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The additional time quoted to complete the scheme return is an underestimate. One respondent expressed the administrator populating the scheme return may not have access to the information required, hence ongoing compliance costs should be higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IAs should measure the total impact to business, therefore costs imposed by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order should be included within the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>âs calculations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of trustees required to familiarise themselves with the new statutory instrument should be higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Respondents challenged whether a non-lawyer could read and understand a page of regulations in 2 minutes. A more realistic time assumption was suggested to be in the region of 2 to 3 hours per trustee to familiarise themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr> did not consider the cost of assessing advisors against objectives or the cost to obtain legal advice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Government response</h3>

<p>117. The government acknowledges the scope of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations is greater than the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. There are 4 differences in policy between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations and the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>118. We have quantified the cost of increasing the scope where possible, such as the cost incurred by employer-sponsored master trusts to set and monitor against investment objectives. However, in some instances we were not able to quantify costs such as the difference between âinterconnected body corporateâ and âjoint-venture groupingsâ. Unquantifiable differences were raised at consultation and no concerns were received, therefore the government concluded the impact to schemes would be immaterial.</p>

<p>119. The government recognises there are additional reporting requirements under <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations, and these are detailed in the <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order requires trustees to check their compliance, complete details on the statement, sign and send to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. Since <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations broadly replicate the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, trustees will already be reporting against the vast majority of the compliance statement. It has been assumed the time taken to compile the additional information is 20 minutes â though upper and lower compliance costs have been considered as part of sensitivity analysis.</p>

<p>120. The counterfactual used for the appraisal period is the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. In a âDo Nothingâ scenario, schemes would be required to comply with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, therefore we do not consider it appropriate to include costs already imposed by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order. The <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr> only assesses the impact on business, and other key stakeholders, above and beyond the existing <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order.</p>

<p>121.  For <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes with 2+ members, we estimate an average of 3.0 trustees per scheme and for <abbr title="Defined Contribution">DC</abbr> schemes with 2+ members, we estimate an average of 2.7 trustees per scheme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>. We expect trustees will have to familiarise themselves with the new requirement, but this could be lower for some schemes. If instead, only 1 trustee per scheme needed to familiarise themselves with the new statutory instrument, costs would be less.</p>

<p>122. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulation broadly replicates the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, therefore we do not expect familiarisation to be a significant additional burden. By the time <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations have been introduced trustees would have already been complying with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order for at least two years, and trustees would have been able to draw upon <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> guidance to assist compliance during that period. Following feedback received, we have increased the time we assume it will take trustees to familiarise from 30 to 114 minutes. The <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr> calculates upper and lower familiarisation costs as part of sensitivity analysis.</p>

<p>123. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order requires pension schemes to (1) carry out a qualifying tender process when entering into or continuing an agreement with a fiduciary management provider and (2) set objectives for the investment consultancy provider when entering into an agreement for the provision of investment consultancy. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations broadly replicate the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order, therefore under the Order schemes would already be assessing advisors against objectives. Additional costs raised in the consultation responses would be required as part of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order and are therefore included in the counterfactual.</p>

<p>124. Recognising the uncertainty around the imposition of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations, the <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr> includes sensitivity analysis around the core assumptions. We have included feedback from the consultation where possible. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> have accepted the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendation to produce guidance for trustees in support of the remedies. Given the level of sensitivity analysis and feedback received, we have not considered the time taken to read <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> guidance in the <abbr title="Impact Assessment">IA</abbr>.</p>

<p>125. A Post-Implementation Review (<abbr title="Post-Implementation Review">PIR</abbr>) requirement has been added to the regulations (Part 4 of the draft Regulations). <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has committed to a review of the regulations and a report will be published by 31st December 2028. The report will assess to what extent the policy objectives have been achieved and if the regulations are still appropriate. If the regulations are still deemed appropriate, additional reviews and reports will be published in intervals not exceeding 5 years.</p>
