<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This consultation seeks views on the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Governance and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations. These proposed regulations would integrate an Order produced by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, following their investigation into the investment consultants market, into pensions law. The regulations set out the steps which trustees need to take when using investment consultant and fiduciary management (<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>) services, and enable The Pensions Regulator (<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) to oversee these responsibilities and ensure more joined-up and efficient compliance.</p>

<h3>About this consultation</h3>

<h4>Who this consultation is aimed at</h4>

<ul>
  <li>pension scheme trustees</li>
  <li>pension scheme service providers, other industry bodies and professionals</li>
  <li>civil society organisations</li>
  <li>pension scheme members and beneficiaries</li>
  <li>any other interested stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose of the consultation</h4>

<p>This consultation seeks views on both the policy proposals described in this document and the draft regulations appended to them.</p>

<h4>Scope of consultation</h4>

<p>Pensions policy is a reserved matter in Scotland and Wales, this consultation therefore applies to England, Wales and Scotland. It is anticipated that Northern Ireland will make corresponding legislation.</p>

<h4>Duration of the consultation</h4>

<p>The consultation period begins on 29 July 2019 and runs until 2 September 2019. Please ensure your response to the draft regulations reaches us by that date as any replies received after that date may not be taken into account.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Background and overview</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>1.	This section summarises the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s investigation and reports into the investment consultancy (<abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>) services industry which have led to these proposed regulatory changes.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> market investigation</h3>

<p>2.	Following a reference from the Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> carried out an investigation into <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services to pension schemes. In broad terms, <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> is the provision of advice to trustees on investment strategy and related matters. <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> involves the delegation by trustees of some investment decisions to advisers. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s provisional decision report was published in July 2018<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>3.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> found an adverse effect on competition and likely customer detriment for trustees, and in turn the employer sponsors of defined benefit (<abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr>) schemes and the members of defined contribution (<abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr>) schemes. They proposed remedies to encourage better trustee engagement when buying both services, and better disclosure of fees and performance.</p>

<p>4.	On 12 December 2018 the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> published its final report<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> on its market investigation. It confirmed their findings that for both services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a low level of engagement by trustees</li>
  <li>there is a lack of clear and comparable information to assess value for money</li>
  <li>customers are steered by consultants towards their own higher-cost <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services, giving them an incumbency advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is legally required to take such action as it considers to be reasonable and practicable to remedy, mitigate or prevent: the adverse effect on the competition concerned or any detrimental effects on consumers as a result<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. In this case, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has put in place an Order which was laid on 10 June 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> and the remedy provisions of the order will come into force on 10 December 2019.</p>

<p>6.	The report also made a number of recommendations to government (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and HM Treasury (<abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr>)) and to regulators (<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) to facilitate the implementation of the remedies (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a">Annex A</a>). The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> recommendation was to pass the necessary legislation to enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to oversee the duties on trustees.</p>

<p>7.	It is government policy to accept <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendations and respond within 90 days, unless there are strong policy reasons not to do so.</p>

<h4>The government’s response to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report</h4>

<p>8.	The government produced a joint response<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> which was published on 12 March 2019 accepting the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> recommendations.</p>

<p>9.	In the joint response, the government committed to take forward the recommendations put to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to pass legislation. This would bring the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> Order into pensions law for remedies 1 (mandatory competitive tendering of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services) and 7 (setting objectives for their <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services) and enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to oversee the new duties on trustees rather than long term enforcement of a small aspect of the legislation applicable to occupational pension schemes by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> also accepted the recommendation to produce guidance to help trustees comply with the new procedures. It also acknowledged that <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> would consider their recommendation and consult in due course.</p>

<p>10.	The <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> were obliged by law to respond separately as they made the original <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> referral and their response<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> was published on 26 February 2019. Their response confirmed that they supported bringing <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services into their perimeter and this would allow them to consult on rules to incorporate the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s remedies into <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>’s regulation of the sector. Their response also confirmed that they would consult on introducing into the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr> Handbook the relevant rules for firms offering <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services. This consultation is anticipated by April 2020.</p>

<p>11.	Similarly, it is expected that <abbr title="HM Treasury">HMT</abbr> will consult later this year on amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>, in response to <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s recommendation to bring investment consultants within the remit of the <abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Overview of our regulations</h3>

<p>12.	We view the proposed remedies set out by the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> as a positive step for improving ongoing trustee engagement and consequential improvements in the value for money of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services. Setting strategic objectives for ICs should empower trustees to monitor performance and value for money more closely. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> regulations, like the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order, should increase competition, allowing smaller and specialist firms to enter the market.</p>

<p>13.	Likewise, the mandatory competitive tendering on first adoption of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> or the continuation of historic <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> may encourage trustees to become more engaged with their investment strategy and make more informed decisions about their schemes’ governance structure, and better decisions around both value and costs.</p>

<p>14.	We have replicated parts 3 (<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> tendering) and 7 (<abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> objectives) of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order in the main, with slight differences in the policy approach as set out in Chapter 2. The monitoring and compliance parts of the order (parts 9 and 10) will also be brought into pensions law through our draft regulations, enabling <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to carry out their regulatory function for these processes. Again further detail of the differences of approach are set out in Chapter 2.</p>

<p>15.	<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will shortly be consulting on their guidance so that stakeholders can review the regulations and guidance together.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>16.	For the purposes of this consultation and the draft regulations we are aiming for a December 2019 or January 2020 laying date and we propose a coming into force date of 6 April 2020.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Our proposals</h2>

<h3>Schemes in scope</h3>

<p>1.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order prescribes that all registrable <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> and <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> occupational pension schemes with 2 or more members are in scope of both remedy 1 and 7 with a number of exceptions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relevant small schemes and executive pension schemes</li>
  <li>public service pension schemes (<abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr>) as defined by the Pensions Act 2004, although local government pension scheme (<abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr>) are in scope for remedy 7</li>
  <li>schemes which are not tax registered</li>
</ul>

<p>2.	Our regulations do not exclude <abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr> as defined by the Pensions Act 2004, but instead limit scope to schemes with trustees. As <abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr> established under the 2004 Act are statutory schemes, they do not have trustees. Additionally, our regulations exclude all schemes which meet the <abbr title="public service pension schemes">PSPSs</abbr> definition in the Pension Schemes Act 1993.</p>

<p>3.	Our regulations do not therefore apply to the <abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr>. In particular, we have made no provision for applying remedy 7 to the <abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr>, as regulations and guidance in relation to the <abbr title="local government pension scheme">LGPS</abbr> are a matter for Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.</p>

<p>4.	In addition, where the trustees are contracting authorities for the purposes of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, they are excluded from remedy one under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order. We have maintained that position.</p>

<p>5.	Finally, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order also excludes certain other types of scheme from both remedies 1 and 7. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schemes where the principal or controlling employer of a scheme is themselves a provider of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services to the schemes</li>
  <li>master trusts for which an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm (or an interconnected body corporate of the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm) is the scheme strategist or scheme funder</li>
</ul>

<p>6.	We agree that it would be impractical in these circumstances to expect the scheme trustees to carry out a competitive tender for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> when they would have a clear and legitimate preference to use the services of the sponsoring employer. However, we believe it is reasonable for the trustee to set their <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> objectives and monitor performance against them, regardless of whether the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> is connected with the sponsoring employer of the scheme. The member can suffer detriment if this is not done.</p>

<p>7.	We are not proposing to make any changes to the treatment of schemes whose trustees own a provider of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> and/or <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services. Such schemes will remain out of scope of both remedies 1 and 7.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 1</h3>

<p>a) Do you agree with our proposals for the scope of the regulations?<br>
b) Do you agree that the draft regulations meet the policy intent?</p>
</div>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>Definitions of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services</p>

<p>8.	As yet there are no definitions in pensions law for <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> or <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services. For the purpose of the regulations it is important that trustees, the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> markets and wider pensions industry have a joint understanding of what is meant by these services. Proposed definitions of both services are therefore introduced.</p>

<p>9.	We have closely followed the definitions of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order, although we have made some relatively minor changes to align terminology with existing pensions legislation and simplify drafting in a small number of places.</p>

<p>10.	In the section of the regulations that describe the meaning of ‘<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider’ we have included a condition to set out that, a provider is also considered to provide an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service where (subject to other conditions in the regulations) they are appointed to carry out asset management, up to 12 months prior to being appointed to provide <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>. This is to ensure that the regulations provide clarity by covering all appointment scenarios or sequences, and avoid any potential misunderstandings or loopholes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 2</h3>

<p>The draft definitions for IC Service and FM Service are contained in the definitions section of the draft regulations.</p>

<p>a) Do you agree with our definitions?<br>
b) Do you agree that the draft regulations meet the policy intent?</p>
</div>

<h3>Use of group undertaking to identify whether bodies are connected</h3>

<p>11.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> proposed the use of “interconnected body corporate of the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider or a partnership or joint venture with the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider” to determine whether organisations were connected for the purposes of identifying whether a scheme was sponsored by an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> or connected body, or a service met the definition of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>.</p>

<p>12.	The “interconnected body corporate” definition, which is typically used in <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> legislation, captures corporate bodies which are subsidiaries of the other, or subsidiaries of subsidiaries, and those with a common parent corporate body.</p>

<p>13.	We are proposing to use group undertaking to capture the full range of relationships. The difference between the definitions of group undertaking and the interconnected body corporate lies in the kinds of bodies which are interconnected. Interconnected body corporate does not capture partnerships or unincorporated associations. So if a partnership or an unincorporated association were the parent of a body corporate, the two would form a group undertaking but not an interconnected body corporate. Interconnected body corporate is therefore a subset of group undertaking.</p>

<p>14.	We anticipate that group undertaking will capture a broader range of ownership and control connections than interconnected body corporate – ownership relationships involving partnerships can still signify influence and control.</p>

<p>15.	Unlike the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order, we do not propose to include the use of ‘joint venture’ in our regulations. This is because joint venture does not signify the same level of ownership and control, given that control will be shared with one or more other undertakings. We also believe that there could be an avoidance risk, so that where a scheme sponsor and an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> had a joint venture, they would not be required to run, or bid for, a competitive tender. This could inadvertently incentivise firms to create joint ventures to circumvent this duty. We therefore intend that even where sponsors and FMs are connected through a joint venture, there should still be a requirement to run a competitive tender.</p>

<p>16.	The overall effect of these changes is that a small number of schemes which might under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order have been in scope of both remedies would now be deemed as sponsored by an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>/<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider and therefore now excluded from remedy 1, although still included in remedy 7. We do not have evidence to suggest that any schemes currently excluded in the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order from both remedies because of a joint venture connection will be now in scope of both remedies.</p>

<p>17.	In addition, a very small number of services which might not have been defined as <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> under the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order – because the firms providing advice did not form an interconnected body corporate with the provider of investment management – would meet the definition of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> if they form a group undertaking.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 3</h3>

<p>a) Do you agree with our proposal to use group undertaking?<br>
b) Do you agree that the draft regulations meet the policy intent?</p>
</div>

<h3>Mandatory tendering for <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>
</h3>

<p>18.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> proposed that trustees must, when entering into or continuing with a <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> agreement, in certain circumstances, carry out a process they called a competitive tender process. This means a process by which pension scheme trustees, or another person appointed by them to act on their behalf, have invited or used reasonable endeavours to obtain bids for the provision of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services from 3 or more unrelated <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> providers and have evaluated the bids received.</p>

<p>19.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order, and our regulations, set out the circumstances under which the trustees are required to carry out a competitive tender. These are outlined in the ‘historic’ and ‘ongoing’ tests. Both of these tests will need to be considered by trustees before deciding whether the competitive tender process is necessary.</p>

<p>20.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order sets out that the assets of the scheme are the funds held by the trustees of the scheme, excluding any asset-backed contribution (<abbr title="asset-backed contribution">ABC</abbr>) arrangements and buy-in policies, although they do not define asset backed contributions and buy-in policies in either their Order or Explanatory Note. Our regulations only exclude buy-in policies from the calculation of assets, as we understand these arrangements are much more commonly used than <abbr title="asset-backed contributions">ABCs</abbr>. A very small proportion of <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes make use of <abbr title="asset-backed contribution">ABC</abbr> arrangements, and numbers of schemes adopting such arrangements does not appear to be significantly increasing.</p>

<p>21.	Elsewhere, we have largely replicated the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order, although we have made some suggested changes to drafting to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the group undertaking test to determine whether FMs are independent of one another and therefore able to compete</li>
  <li>changing and clarifying references in the definition of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services means that the services from firms who are not an interconnected body corporate but are a group undertaking will fall into scope of an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service (see paragraph 17 above)</li>
  <li>make clear that the service remains <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>, even if no advice has been given in past 12 months. It was the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s intention that the test for an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service is a one-off test, so that where a service has met the definition of an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service in relation to a particular scheme at a particular point in time, it should continue to meet the definition of an <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> service – for as long as arrangements are still in place for the provision of that service</li>
</ul>

<p>22.	For the avoidance of doubt, it is our intention, as with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order, that for sectionalised pension schemes, for example, hybrid schemes, the 20% threshold is calculated from the whole of the scheme not a section of the scheme.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 4</h3>

<p>a) Do you agree with our proposals for FM tendering?<br>
b) Do you agree that the draft regulations meet the policy intent?</p>
</div>

<h3>Setting objectives for investment consultants</h3>

<p>23.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> report set out its remedies for improving the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services received by customers. The aim is that pension scheme trustees better monitor the performance of their <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider by setting and measuring them against an appropriate set of strategic objectives. In addition to this it is the intention that trustees must not enter into an agreement for the provision of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services unless strategic objectives have been set for the provider.</p>

<p>24.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> measure applies to anyone providing a service which meets the proposed legal definition of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>, whether that service is described or promoted as being <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>. Where a scheme engages with its actuary, or an independent financial adviser or any service meeting this definition, it will be subject to the objective setting requirements.</p>

<p>25.	We have largely replicated this, only making changes in some aspects so that the measure sits better with existing pensions legislation. We refer to “objectives” rather than “strategic objectives” to avoid the unintended perception that only objectives relating to investment strategy should be included. We have also dropped the exclusion of “high level commentary” by scheme actuaries from the definition of <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>, as a service meeting the definition of one appears to have no practical possibility of meeting the definition of the other. We do not, however, intend that advice from the scheme lawyer(s) on investment matters is considered as <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> and therefore we have specifically excluded from our regulations the duty for trustees to set objectives for them.</p>

<p>26.	We expect trustees to:</p>

<p>a)	set objectives for their <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> service that have regard to the statement of investment principles<br>
b)	review the performance of each <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider against their objectives at least every 12 months, and<br>
c)	review the objectives at least every 3 years and without delay after any significant change in investment policy</p>

<p>27.	We have not made provision in law, but we expect that objectives:</p>

<p>(a)	 include a clear definition of the outcome expected to be delivered and the timescale over which it will be delivered<br>
(b)	should be relevant to the services provided<br>
(c)	should also enable the trustee to measure the performance of the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> services provided</p>

<p>28.	Where trustees have existing arrangements with ICs which pre-date the coming into force of these regulations for which they have not yet set objectives, our draft legislation proposes that they should set objectives with immediate effect.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 5</h3>

<p>a) Do you agree with our proposals for investment consultant objectives?<br>
b) Do you agree that the draft regulations meet the policy intent?</p>
</div>

<h3>Reporting compliance</h3>

<p>29.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> proposed that pension scheme trustees would be required to submit compliance statements to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> confirming the extent to which they had complied with the articles of parts 3 and 7 of the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order which were in force during the reporting period.</p>

<p>30.	Our regulations will enable <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to oversee the remedies that apply to trustees and for them to carry out the appropriate monitoring, compliance and enforcement activity. Trustees will be required, within the existing scheme return process (through the exchange platform), to report compliance in relation to the new requirements outlined in the legislation. The compliance process follows the same processes as those currently in place for the automatic enrolment charges measures.</p>

<p>31.	Amendments to The Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 2005<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>, will require <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> to ask additional questions on the scheme returns for trustees to complete. This is because it gives opportunity for schemes to certify compliance or non-compliance and to provide <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> with intelligence which it may be beneficial to investigate further. The scheme return will include:</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> Services</h4>

<p>(a)	the name and address of the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider<br>
(b)	the most recent date on which the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider was appointed<br>
(c)	whether the trustees have set objectives for the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider, and if not, why not<br>
(d)	whether the trustees have reviewed the objectives set for the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider and if not, why not<br>
(e)	whether the trustees have reviewed the services provided by the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr> provider and if not, why not</p>

<h4>For <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> Services</h4>

<p>(a)	the name and address of the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider, and<br>
(b)	(for schemes which are under the 20% threshold of scheme assets on the coming into force date)<br>
i.	the most recent date on which the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider was appointed<br>
ii.	whether the trustees carried out a qualifying tender process in connection with the appointment, and if not, why not<br>
(c)	(for schemes which are over the 20% threshold of scheme assets on the coming into force date)<br>
i.	the date on which the <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> provider was first appointed<br>
ii.	whether the trustees have carried out a qualifying tender process in connection with the arrangements, and if not, why not</p>

<p>32.	We are also proposing to remove the following requirements from the scheme return as these are unnecessary for most schemes or of limited usefulness for <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the scheme is a public service pension scheme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>whether the scheme or any part of the scheme is protected by a Crown guarantee<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>the nature of the business of any relevant employer<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 6</h3>

<p>a) Do you agree with our proposed approach to compliance?<br>
b) Do you agree that the draft regulations meet the policy intent?</p>
</div>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>33.	The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> approach is to give directions in writing for the purposes of carrying out, or ensuring compliance with their order. They may vary or revoke any directions so given.</p>

<p>34.	Our regulations set out our approach to using a discretionary regime of compliance notices and penalties. This process is similar to the compliance provisions already required for the automatic enrolment charges measures which <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> trustees will already be familiar with.</p>

<h3>Question 7</h3>

<h3>Other minor regulatory changes</h3>

<p>35.	A number of other minor technical changes are included in the regulations so that they better align with the terminology and style of existing pensions legislation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 8</h3>

<p>Do you have any comments on these or any other aspects of our proposals or the drafting of the regulations?</p>
</div>

<h3>Impacts</h3>

<p>36.	A draft impact assessment estimating the direct and indirect financial impacts on business and on others has been published alongside this consultation. We are using the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> order as the baseline and only the new legislative changes will contribute to the equivalent annual net direct cost to business of this package of regulations. We would welcome any evidenced comments on the impact assessment.</p>

<p>37.	Specifically, we would welcome evidence of:</p>

<h4>a) Competitive tender</h4>

<p>Our assumptions about the use of group undertaking rather than interconnected body corporate to determine whether FMs are independent of one another and therefore able to compete. We do not know precisely how many organisations will be impacted by this policy change. We assume trustees would avoid more than one approach to firms which formed a group undertaking and would instead seek a different tender.</p>

<h4>b) Definition of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services</h4>

<p>Our assumptions around changing the references in the definition to group undertaking rather than interconnected body corporate, and services therefore falling into scope of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr>. We do not know precisely how many organisations will be impacted by this policy change. We assume the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> captured all such schemes and that no firms are impacted by the change in the definition of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services.</p>

<h4>c) Schemes where the principal or controlling employer of a scheme is themselves a provider of <abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> services, and Master Trusts for which an <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm (or a group undertaking of the <abbr title="investment consultancy">IC</abbr>-<abbr title="fiduciary management">FM</abbr> firm) is the scheme strategist or scheme funder</h4>

<p>Our assumptions around the number of schemes impacted and therefore required to set and monitor objectives.</p>

<h4>d) Compliance reporting</h4>

<p>Our assumptions around the resources to compile the information and complete the questions in the scheme return.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Question 9</h3>

<p>Do you have any comments on these or other business burdens and benefits, and wider non-monetised impacts we have estimated in the draft impact assessment?</p>
