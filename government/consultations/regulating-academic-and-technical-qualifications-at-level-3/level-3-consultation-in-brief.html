<h2>Our consultation is proposing amends to our regulations that will bring students high-quality alternatives to A levels and T Levels, by</h2>

<ul>
  <li>making sure these qualifications are high quality:
    <ul>
      <li>proposing requirements for the assessment of content, so that the knowledge, skills and understanding are assessed appropriately for
        <ul>
          <li>alternative academic qualifications where there is no nationally-set subject content</li>
          <li>alternative technical qualifications where subject content should align with the employer-led occupational standards published by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education</li>
          <li>seeking views on how to ensure the standards of those assessments that are directly graded by assessors</li>
          <li>requiring awarding organisations to explain how they will design, develop, deliver and award these qualifications</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>making it clearer to understand the purpose of these qualifications, so that it is simpler for students to make informed choices and navigate the level 3 qualifications landscape:
    <ul>
      <li>specifying the general purposes (for alternative academic qualifications only)</li>
      <li>seeking views on grading scales and how these qualifications are titled to help users identify these qualifications and understand their results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seeking views on Ofqual’s approach to regulating for alternative technical qualifications</p>
  </li>
  <li>ensuring that the alternative academic qualification assessment arrangements are thorough, manageable and support standards to be maintained:
    <ul>
      <li>specifying 40% as the minimum percentage of a qualification that must be assessed through an exam</li>
      <li>expecting exams to be marked by the awarding organisation and be available in up to 2 assessment series on set dates in each academic year</li>
      <li>allowing awarding organisations to either mark or grade non-exam assessments themselves, permit centres to assess them, or use a combination of these approaches</li>
      <li>requiring awarding organisations to set non-exam assessments themselves and to allow them to accept marks from centres on up to 2 occasions in each academic year</li>
      <li>requiring awarding organisation to use approaches to setting standards that will allow the consistent maintenance of standards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
