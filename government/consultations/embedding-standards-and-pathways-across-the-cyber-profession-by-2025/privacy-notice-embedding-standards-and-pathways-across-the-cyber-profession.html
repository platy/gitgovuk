<span class="number">1. </span>Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport privacy notice for the consultation to embed standards and pathways across the cyber profession by 2025</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Who is collecting my data?</h3>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) helps to drive growth, enrich lives and promote Britain abroad.</p>

<p>We protect and promote our cultural and artistic heritage and help businesses and communities to grow by investing in innovation and highlighting Britain as a fantastic place to visit. We help to give the UK a unique advantage on the global stage, striving for economic success.</p>

<p>This website (“Website“) is run by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (“we” and “us“, “DCMS“). DCMS is the controller for the personal information we process, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Purpose of this Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>This notice is provided within the context of the notice provided to meet the obligations as set out in Article 13 (this sets out the info we have to provide  where the data is received directly from the data subject). Article 13 of UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). This notice sets out how we will use your personal data as part of our legal obligations with regard to Data Protection.</p>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> explains how we deal with your information. It also explains how you can ask to view, change or remove your information from our records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Privacy policies of other websites</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.qualtrics.com/privacy-statement/" rel="external">Privacy statement for the survey website</a></p>

<p>Please note, additional terms in our (DCMS’s) contract with Qualtrics ensure that your data will not be transferred out of the EU.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>What is personal data?</h3>

<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural living person, otherwise known as a ‘data subject’. A data subject is someone who can be recognised, directly or indirectly, by information such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or data relating to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. These types of identifying information are known as ‘personal data’. Data protection law applies to the processing of personal data, including its collection, use and storage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>What personal data do we collect?</h3>

<p>Most of the personal information we collect and process is provided to us directly by you. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal identifiers, contacts and characteristics (such as name and contact details including email addresses)</li>
  <li>information relating to the size and sector of your employer, organisation or business</li>
  <li>information on how you use this website (this includes IP address and analytical cookies)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>How will we use your data?</h3>

<p>We use personal information for a wide range of purposes, to enable us to carry out our functions as a government department.</p>

<p>Your personal data is being collected as an essential part of the consultation process, so that we can contact you regarding your response and for statistical purposes, such as to ensure individuals and organisations cannot complete the survey more than once, or to recontact you for further information (should you grant us this permission).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>What is the legal basis for processing my data?</h3>

<p>To process this personal data, our legal reason for collecting or processing this data is: Article 6(1).</p>

<p>Article 6(1) you have freely given your consent – it will be clear to you what you are consenting to and how you can withdraw your consent</p>

<p>The lawful basis that we rely on to process your personal data will determine which of the following rights are available to you. Much of the processing we do in DCMS will be necessary to meet our legal obligations or to perform a public task. If we hold personal data about you in different parts of DCMS for different purposes, then the legal basis we rely on in each case may not be the same.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>What will happen if I do not provide this data?</h3>

<p>Completion of the consultation is optional and you are not required to complete the survey. In addition, you can complete the survey and opt out of providing personal data.</p>

<p>Much of the data we seek to process is optional and you are given the choice within the survey of not answering a question. However, in some cases the collection of data is mandatory in order to process your response (i.e. IP address, cookies).</p>

<p>If you do not agree to the collection of this data you should not complete the survey.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9 </span>Who will your data be shared with?</h3>

<p>We will let you know if we are going to share your personal data with other organisations – and whether you can say no. You can ask us for details of agreements we have with other organisations for sharing your information.
If you write to us on a subject that is not our policy area, and the response needs to come from another government department, we will transfer your correspondence, including the personal data, to that department.
You can also ask us for details of any circumstances in which we can pass on your personal data without telling you. This might be, for example, to prevent and detect crime or to produce anonymised statistics.
We won’t make your personal data available for commercial use without your specific permission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.10 </span>How long will my data be held for?</h3>

<p>We will only retain your personal data for 2 years after the close of the consultation  in line with DCMS retention policy. This is so that the department is able to contact you regarding the result of the consultation, following analysis of the responses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.11 </span>Will my data be used for automated decision making or profiling?</h3>

<p>We will not normally use your data for any automated decision making. If we need to do so, we will let you know.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.12 </span>Will my data be transferred outside the UK and if it is how will it be protected?</h3>

<p>We will not send your data beyond the European Economic Area. If we need to do so, we will let you know.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.13 </span>Links to other websites</h3>

<p>Where we provide links to websites of other organisations, this privacy notice does not cover how that organisation processes personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy notices of the other websites you visit.</p>

<p>Qualtrics is the online survey platform used to submit responses to this consultation. They will store the data in accordance with the controller’s instructions and their privacy policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.14 </span>What are your data protection rights?</h3>

<p>You have rights over your personal data under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018). The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is the supervisory authority for data protection legislation, and maintains a full explanation of these rights on their website 
DCMS will ensure that we uphold your rights when processing your personal data.</p>
