<p>Any personal data supplied by you when responding to the consultation will be processed by the Home Office in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and in accordance with Home Office data protection privacy notices. The Secretary of State for the Home Department is the controller of this information.</p>

<h2>Data we are collecting</h2>

<p>We have asked respondents to provide the following information for the purpose of the consultation should they wish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the capacity in which they are responding to the consultation (individual, organisation, trade body or other representative group)</li>
  <li>name of the organisation, trade body or other representative group</li>
  <li>details of the organisation, trade body or other representative group (if relevant)</li>
</ul>

<p>Individually or collectively, this and any other information provided in the consultation may enable a respondent to be identified. If someone responds to the online consultation survey, we will consequently also collect their IP address, and if someone responds via email, we will have collected their email address.</p>

<p>We will not keep any personal data collected longer than is necessary for the purpose for which they are being processed. Your personal data will be retained for as long as necessary for the purpose of the consultation and any associated policy decisions and in accordance with the Home Office data retention policy.</p>

<h2>How and why the Home Office uses your information</h2>

<p>This consultation includes proposals to:
* Examine the support for an Emergency Evacuation Information Sharing (EEIS) proposal, which aims to support the fire safety of residents unable to self-evacuate in an emergency situation;
* Implement a fire safety ‘toolkit’ for all responsible persons;
* Create a working group to establish in what capacity neighbours can assist with evacuation in an emergency situation.
* Establish a call for evidence for a number of areas, including for evidence of existing workable Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans.</p>

<p>The purpose of the consultation is to gather views which will be used to inform future policy and legislation.</p>

<p>During the consultation period the Home Office will engage with a wide range of external stakeholders and individuals. The Home Office collects and processes personal information including during the course of this consultation to enable it to carry out its statutory and other functions. The Home Office is only allowed to process your data where there is a lawful basis for doing so. In this case the Home Office, as a government department, may process personal data for the purpose of a public task i.e. the consultation. We consider the processing to be necessary for the performance of this task carried out in the public interest.</p>

<p>The personal data collected will assist to understand the views of respondents and to see if there are significant differences between types of respondents and to assist future policy development. We may illustrate findings through quotes provided to the consultation. We will ensure these are appropriately anonymised and do not include any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We will publish high-level analysis, including breakdowns by the data we collect and the organisations who have responded, but not individuals, in the government response to this consultation. This will help us and those reading the government response to understand how views differ across different groups.</p>

<h2>How we will process your personal data</h2>

<p>We will not publish IP or email addresses, or any personal information inadvertently provided in the responses. The Home Office will process your information in accordance with data protection legislation and the Home Office Personal Information Charter.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this consultation, the Home Office will not share your information with other organisations, apart from those processing personal data on its behalf. Where such processing is undertaken outside the EEA, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure that your rights in relation to data protection will not be compromised by this.</p>

<p>Your personal data will not be used for any automated decision making.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">More information about how the Home Office looks after your personal information can be found at: www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter</a>.</p>

<h2>Storing your information</h2>

<p>Your personal information will be held on a secure government IT system for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it is being processed and in line with departmental retention policy. <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">More details of this policy can be found at www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter</a>.</p>
