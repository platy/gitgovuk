<span class="number">1. </span>Summary - Intervention and impacts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Policy background and issue, Rationale for Intervention and Intended Effects</h3>

<p>Lack of long-term planning and poor risk management among some trustees in defined benefit (<abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr>) occupational pension schemes presents the risk that their members will not receive the full benefits they have been promised. To reduce the risk to members the Pension Schemes Act 2021 requires trustees of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> pension schemes to determine a funding and investment strategy for ensuring that pensions benefits can be provided over the long term.</p>

<p>The 2018 White Paper<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> found that the scheme funding system was working well for the majority of (<abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr>) pension schemes, but good practice was not universal. It proposed a package of measures to improve decision-making and governance for all schemes by delivering clearer more enforceable scheme funding standards, with a greater focus on risk management and longer-term planning.</p>

<p>Some schemes were taking a short-term view of funding requirements and may not be effectively setting an investment strategy and managing the long-term obligations of the scheme and therefore inadequately anticipating or managing scheme funding risks. Severely underfunded schemes present a risk to members, the Pension Protection Fund (<abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr>) and ultimately other <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr> levy payers. If the sponsoring employer of the scheme becomes insolvent then the scheme may have to enter the <abbr title="Pension Protection Fund">PPF</abbr>, resulting in some members potentially losing 10% or more of their benefits<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. Therefore, government intervention is necessary to ensure that schemes are making investment decisions in a way which results in the highest probability of members receiving their pensions in full. The draft regulations set out the key principles for setting and revising the funding and investment strategy and detail the evidence that must be provided in the statement of strategy. The practical details and metrics will be provided by The Pensions Regulator (<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) in a revised <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice. These changes are necessary to raise standards and to ensure all schemes plan for the long term and mitigate risks in a maturing <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> landscape. They are also needed to support <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s scheme funding powers by making clearer what all <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes are required to do.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Brief description of viable policy options considered (including alternatives to regulation)</h3>

<p>We considered the following options:</p>

<h4>Option 0: Do nothing</h4>

<p>Leaving the system unchanged would not deliver improvements to the scheme funding regime. Funding standards would lack clarity, which would continue to lead to poor decision making by schemes, and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> would continue to find them difficult to enforce. Although many schemes have a long term objective (<abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr>) in place, evidence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> suggests that a sizeable minority do not. As a result, members of these schemes would be at risk of poorer retirement outcomes, because of poor decision making outside the scope of existing <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> powers.</p>

<h4>Option 1: Making the <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice enforceable</h4>

<p>Making the <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> enforceable would not resolve the problem of lack of clarity and could make things worse by giving statutory force to something that was already unclear. In addition, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> has already taken steps to support trustees’ voluntary application of the Code, and this has not been enough to suggest that making it enforceable would be effective.</p>

<h4>Option 2 (preferred option): Introduce secondary legislation to provide detail of the requirements in the Pension Schemes Act 2021 to:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Impose a duty on trustees to have a funding and investment strategy so that as a minimum by the time the scheme is significantly mature there is low dependency on the sponsoring employer and investments have high resilience to risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Require trustees to set out the funding and investment strategy in a statement of strategy that is signed by the chair of the trustees on behalf of the trustee board, who must appoint a chair if they do not already have one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introduce a new regulation, to be used alongside existing regulations to support clearer funding standards by clarifying key terms such as “appropriateness” and “prudence”, in secondary legislation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Preferred option: Summary of assessment of impact on business and other main affected groups</h3>

<p>We will not be able to determine the full impacts and costs that are introduced by these legislative changes until the detail of all components of the regime are known – this includes the Pensions Regulator’s revised Defined Benefit Funding Code of practice which will contain more detailed guidance and specification on how to comply with legislative requirements in setting the Funding and Investment Strategy. A Business Impact Target (<abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> will be completed by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> following their consultation to accompany the revised <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice. At this stage, we give a high-level assessment of possible business and other impacts. Once that is completed, we will update our impact assessment of these legislative changes accordingly.</p>

<p>We anticipate there to be minor familiarisation and implementation gross cost to business, partially offset by savings for schemes associated with improved clarity of the requirements.</p>

<p>The impact of any changes to deficit repair contributions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> (<abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr>) as a result of the funding and investment strategy will be included in <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr> assessment. These costs would result from legislative changes however it is the <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> revised <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice which will determine the scale of these costs.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Additional detail – policy, analysis, and impacts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Setting the long term objective - costs and benefits to businesses</h3>

<h4>1. Background information – scheme liabilities; and scheme running strategies and objectives</h4>

<p><abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> pension schemes provide pensions and other benefits usually based on final salary or career average salary and length of service, as set out in the scheme rules. Risks, including longevity risk and investment return risk<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, are borne by the scheme and its sponsoring employer not members. A scheme’s funding position is evaluated annually as required by legislation and an actuarial valuation is completed at least every three years.</p>

<p>A scheme’s funding position is the difference between the assets the scheme holds and its liabilities (i.e. how much it is expected to have to pay out to its members). <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> liability (and hence funding position) estimates inherently carry an element of uncertainty as, for example, it is impossible to estimate future longevity or investment returns with certainty. There are a range of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> scheme liability measures, each designed and used for a specific purpose. They differ in the way the assumptions needed to assess scheme liabilities (like future investment returns) are made. The most relevant measures for the purposes of this impact assessment are the Statutory Funding Objective (<abbr title="Statutory Funding Objective">SFO</abbr>) and the International Accounting Standard Nineteen (<abbr title="International Accounting Standard Nineteen">IAS19</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Statutory Funding Objective: The “statutory funding objective” requires schemes to have sufficient and appropriate assets to cover its “technical provisions”. A scheme’s “technical provisions” (<abbr title="technical provisions">TPs</abbr>) are defined as the amount required, on an actuarial calculation, to make provision for the scheme’s liabilities. Trustees and employers agree the methods and assumptions (which must be prudent) used in the actuarial calculation. The Pension Schemes Act 2021 introduces a new requirement for a scheme’s <abbr title="technical provisions">TPs</abbr> to be calculated in a way that is consistent with the funding and investment strategy as set out in the statement of strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International Accounting Standards 19: This valuation method is used when companies report their annual accounts. The methodology is set on a common basis to facilitate international comparisons.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Details of all four widely used valuation methods are set out in <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s ‘Understanding the different ways of valuing a defined benefit scheme’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Scheme liabilities are a product of a range of factors including: the number of members; the amount of pension benefits and survivor benefits promised; and longevity. Some of these factors are not known and will be estimated by the scheme actuary using assumptions agreed by the trustees and the employer.</p>

<p>Existing good funding practice, encouraged by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s current <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> scheme funding code of practice and other guidance, already encourages schemes to have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> and to use an Integrated Risk Management model to consider risks to funding, investments and employer covenant in an integrated way. However, this good practice is not mandatory.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes may have different strategies and objectives regarding how they are run in the long-term (more detail and discussion can be found in the White Paper). Examples of an acceptable funding and investment strategy (referred to as a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> in the White Paper) could be to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reach self-sufficiency at significant maturity with a funding and investment strategy that has high resilience to investment risk and low dependency on the sponsoring employer (the minimum requirement)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buy-out by a set time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter a consolidator vehicle within an agreed timeframe</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The existing good funding practice, facilitated by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>, already encourages schemes to have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> in place. However, it is not mandatory.</p>

<h4>2. The baseline / counterfactual</h4>

<p>Most <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> (sometimes known as a target) in place. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Research 2018<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> found 76% of trustees and 79% of employers responded that schemes closed to future accrual had in place a journey plan or long-term target, which leaves nearly a quarter that did not have an explicit long-term target. Surveys from pensions consultancies also tend to suggest that most schemes already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr>. For example, according to Aon’s Survey<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>, which interviewed 170 schemes, only 8% did not have a long-term plan (but note that Aon’s clients may not represent the industry average).</p>

<p>Based on this evidence, we assume that 80% of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> in place (a lower end estimate between the 76% <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> research and 92% Aon Survey). As this is a point in time estimate, we also assume that there is a constant proportion in the counterfactual over time. This assumption is based on signals suggesting that although the proportions of schemes with different objectives have been changing over recent years, the proportion reporting no or unknown objectives stayed broadly similar (e.g., 6% according to Aon’s survey 2015 and 8% according to Aon’s survey 2017).</p>

<p>However, as pointed out by <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> and referenced in the Department’s White Paper, schemes may well have a long-term plan but for some the plan may be largely aspirational and does not drive funding and Deficit Repair Contribution (DRC) commitment. Such schemes will need to adjust their funding plans and sponsoring employers will need to fund their schemes in line with their <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr>. Any schemes with a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> which is currently weaker than low dependency funding by significant maturity will need to set a stronger long-term target as part of their new funding and investment strategy and must be funded to that level.   Employers are already required to fund the pension benefits and the new funding and investment strategy does not itself increase overall costs. But it may well bring forward contributions and increase costs in the short and medium term.</p>

<h4>3. Business impacts</h4>

<p>The proposed option will require schemes to set a funding and investment strategy for providing pension benefits over the long term. The 2018 White Paper referred to this as a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr>. The minimum requirement is low dependency funding<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> by significant maturity with a high resilience to investment risk. A minority of schemes which remain open to both further accrual and to new members, which are in a steady state and not maturing, will not move towards their long-term funding and investment targets.</p>

<p>The business impacts will mainly be for schemes whose <abbr title="technical provisions">TPs</abbr> are currently weaker than what would be required for them to achieve low dependency funding at significant maturity with a high resilience to investment risk (i.e., they are on the wrong path).</p>

<p>These schemes will have to strengthen their <abbr title="technical provisions">TPs</abbr>, potentially leading to the emergence of a deficit or an increase in deficit, and therefore potentially requiring <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr> or increased <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr>. Other impacts will arise for schemes currently taking too much unsupported risk (i.e., too weak an employer covenant and/or too mature).</p>

<p>The draft Regulations and <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s revised <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice will link the investment risk that a scheme should support to the strength of the employer covenant and scheme maturity. The Code will provide specific metrics for discount rates for the fast-track compliance route. The full impacts will be assessed as part of the <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr> assessment following the Code being consulted on.</p>

<h4>3.1. Familiarisation and implementation costs.</h4>

<p>There are 5,220 <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes in total<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>. As set out above, we assume 80% already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> in place. That means the remaining 1,044 schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> will be directly affected by the requirement. As some schemes may have a largely aspirational plan, which does not drive scheme management and funding decisions, we make an assumption about the number of schemes with a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> that does not drive scheme management decisions. The percentage of schemes with a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> that is only aspirational could be anywhere between 0% and 100%. In the absence of any certain information, we assume that half of those that already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> have it as an aspiration – i.e., 2,088<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> schemes. Sensitivity analysis around this assumption is conducted below in section 3.1.1.</p>

<p>Initially, these draft Regulations set the requirements. However, the <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> Code will define the concepts quantitatively. It will look at what is low dependency (discount rate and other assumptions), significant maturity and high resilience to risk. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> has undertaken an initial consultation and published an interim response<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> sought views on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Their proposed approach to the revised <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice (twin-track compliance routes and their approach to prudence and risk-taking).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key principles that they propose should underpin the Code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Options for how these principles could be applied in practice through more detailed guidelines).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will undertake a second consultation on the draft <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code of Practice itself and the guidelines it will contain, informed by the responses to this first consultation, their <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr> (following the consultation) and legislation. At this stage, before the consultation and exact requirements and guidance are agreed, we cannot estimate familiarisation and implementation (and other) costs with certainty. As set out above, a full assessment will be in <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr>. For now, we give an illustration of the potential scale of impact only.</p>

<p>Through discussion with policy colleagues who have worked on the funding and investment strategy legalisation, the following assumptions have been made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It will take a day (8 hours) for a trustee to read through and ‘absorb’ the changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One trustee from those schemes that already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> will need to familiarise (sharing the information with other trustees of the scheme is then assumed to be negligible).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All trustees from those schemes that have none or just an aspirational <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> will have to familiarise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are 3.2 trustees per <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> scheme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>, on average. Assuming an average hourly wage of a trustee of around £29 per hour<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> and applying the figures and assumptions above gives a cost estimate for familiarisation at the secondary stage of around £2.8 million<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Those schemes that do not already have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> will need to agree one, as part of determining their funding and investment strategy. It must be agreed with the employer which is likely to involve negotiations along with advice from the scheme actuary and advisers such as investment managers and covenant advisers. Associated costs are expected to vary on a scheme-by-scheme basis – from negligible for those that already have a clear strategy and just need to formalise it, to potentially material for those that are currently applying a short-term approach to scheme management (focused only on the next triennial review). At this stage, we cannot quantify the costs of determining and agreeing a funding and investment strategy due to the scheme specific nature and significant uncertainties involved. <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> will consult before any changes to the <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> Funding Code are made and will analyse the impact on their <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr>. As mentioned in the Department’s White Paper, <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s initial view based on their experience is that the governance costs of setting a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> will be relatively low for those already adopting good practice and applying the principles set out in the <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> funding code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>3.1.1. Familiarisation/Implementation Cost- Sensitivity Analysis</h4>

<p>We have arbitrarily assumed that 50% of the schemes with a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> have it as an aspiration rather than firm commitment. If all schemes with a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> were to have this as an aspiration rather than firm commitment, all 5,220 schemes would have to go through the full familiarisation process with all trustees reading through and transposing the requirements. In this worst-case scenario, the total familiarisation cost to businesses would be approximately £3.9 million<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>. However, if all schemes with a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> currently have it as a firm commitment, then only schemes who do not have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> currently would have to complete the full familiarisation process. As discussed above we assume 20% of schemes do not have a <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> currently, and therefore only 1,044 schemes would have to go through the full familiarisation process. This would result in total familiarisation costs of around £1.7m<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>3.2. Ongoing costs and benefits.</h4>

<p>As set out above, having a funding and investment strategy in place will not alter the schemes’ underlying pension liabilities. However, it may have some implications on scheme servicing and associated costs. Broadly speaking, clearer funding requirements, including a funding and investment strategy, may have the following implications on some schemes:</p>

<p>1)	Scheme liability estimates and associated contributions.</p>

<p>Any estimates of scheme liabilities and hence net funding position inherently carry a degree of uncertainty (irrespective of the funding and investment strategy that is chosen). Those schemes that are currently targeting artificially low pension scheme liabilities and/or inconsistently with their <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> may need to revise their approach because of the proposed changes. In some cases, the change in the valuation may lead to an estimated deficit or a higher estimated deficit which will in turn require a recovery plan and <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr> or higher <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr>. This does not change the real (underlying) pension liability; but it alters the way the scheme is being serviced. In essence, some contributions into the scheme are brought forward, but the overall funding requirement over the scheme’s lifetime is not altered. However, applying discounting (as required by the HMT’s Green Book) to cash flows means there may be a net cost to business from contributions brought forward even if the overall scheme’s lifetime gross servicing cost remains unaffected. The impact of any changes to <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr> as a result of the funding and investment strategy will be included in <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr> assessment.</p>

<p>However, in some cases the scheme funding (and hence business cost) impact may be the opposite. Current lack of clarity in funding requirements and the scheme’s <abbr title="long term objective">LTO</abbr> means there is a risk that in some cases schemes may be applying overly cautious assumptions for the purposes of their valuations leading to inflated deficit estimates and associated costs. The requirement to have a specific funding and investment strategy and clearer funding standards more generally may lead to savings for some schemes.</p>

<p>In any case, clearer requirements are expected to reduce the amount of time and resources schemes need to invest in understanding what is required from them.</p>

<p>2)	A change in the scheme’s chosen investment strategy.</p>

<p>Existing evidence shows that many schemes are already considering different objectives depending on their scheme specific circumstances – see figure 1 below.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Distributions of LTOs by scheme sizes.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/158401/distributions-of-ltos-by-scheme-sizes.png"></div></figure>

<p>Source: Aon, Global Pensions Risk Survey 2017<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Pension Schemes Act 2021 introduced the requirement for schemes to set a funding and investment strategy, including funding and investment targets. Once this is agreed, some schemes may need to revise their approach to funding and investments in order to achieve these targets.</p>

<p>They may need to change their investment strategy such that it is invested with a higher resilience to risk, reducing reliance on the employer covenant by the time the scheme is significantly mature. In this case it is possible that schemes receive lower investment returns (for example if they shift from equities to bonds), which could in turn lead to higher employer contributions or <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr> in some cases. However, this comes with an expectation of lower volatility and so less risk of substantially increased employer contributions or <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr> in the future if investment expectations do not materialise. The impact of any changes to employer contributions or <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr> as a result of investing with a higher resilience to risk, and hence assuming lower future investment returns in practice, will be included in <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>’s <abbr title="Business Impact Target">BIT</abbr> assessment, along with other items that could impact employer contributions or <abbr title="deficit repair contributions">DRCs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>3.3. Indirect impact – potential company balance sheet and credit rating impacts.</h4>

<p>As set out above, there may be some schemes that will see an increase in their estimated <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> pension liability as a result of the proposed requirement for a funding and investment strategy. However, when it comes to company balance sheets, the overarching <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> liability measurement standard is <abbr title="International Accounting Standard Nineteen">IAS19</abbr> – which is based on a standardised set of assumptions for schemes. We anticipate that this should not affect the <abbr title="International Accounting Standard Nineteen">IAS19</abbr>-based deficits since it is based on standardised assumptions that are not likely to be affected by the changes.</p>

<h4>4. Costs and benefits to scheme members</h4>

<p>There will be no costs to members as there will be no need for them to familiarise with the changes or implement them. The requirement is aimed to improve scheme funding. Better scheme funding is anticipated to improve the security of members’ pensions – i.e., to increase the likelihood of members ending up getting their pensions paid in full. It is not deemed proportionate to monetise this benefit.</p>

<h4>5. Small and Micro Business Assessment (<abbr title="Small and Micro Business Assessment">SaMBA</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The costs to business fall on funded (private sector) <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> pension schemes. As shown in Figure 2 below, small, and micro schemes are less likely to be compliant and as a result, are more likely to incur costs because of the proposed changes. In the case of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes, the sponsoring employer will be responsible for these costs. Therefore, businesses that sponsor small schemes are more likely to incur a cost because of the proposed change. As such, it is possible that small and micro businesses that sponsor small <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> pension schemes may be affected.</p>

<p>Source: <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> Defined benefit trust-based pension schemes research summary report.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes are predominately of medium or large sizes. As shown in the table below, 36% of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes have less than 100 members and are therefore considered to be small. The proposed changes are expected to have a disproportionate impact on small schemes, however these schemes make up a smaller proportion of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> schemes in total.</p>

<p>Assessing the impact of the proposed changes here on this group is difficult. As it is not necessarily the case that small and micro pension schemes correspond to small and micro businesses. For example, large firms may run a <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> scheme with only a few members. Similarly, small employers may enter their staff into a large <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> scheme (as it is possible for a <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> scheme to be sponsored by more than one employer). As this legislation will affect schemes depending on their compliance with the requirements in the baseline and small schemes are less compliant, employers that sponsor small schemes are likely to be disproportionately affected. There is currently no robust evidence to link pension scheme size to employer size and so it is difficult to accurately assess the impact on small and micro businesses.</p>

<p>There is information in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (<abbr title="Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings">ASHE</abbr>) data set on the size of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> sponsoring employers with active members. This will only include those who are contributing to a <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> pension so will exclude members who are in schemes closed for future accrual, but it helps to provide an indication of the size of <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> sponsoring employers. The table below shows the proportion of private sector and not for profit active <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> members by employer size.</p>

<p>*Figures are rounded to the nearest 1%.</p>

<p>This information above provides evidence that the majority (88%) of active <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> members are employed at businesses with 50 or more employees (and hence not a small or micro business). However, there is no information on the business sizes where there are no longer active members, and this does not provide information about the size of the scheme that the members are in. But it does provide an indication that most <abbr title="Defined Benefit">DB</abbr> sponsoring employers are medium or large employers.</p>

<h4>6.	Monitoring and Evaluation</h4>

<p>We will work with <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> and the industry in order to understand and review the post-implementation impact and publish a report setting out the conclusions of the review, in accordance with sections 28 to 32 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c.26). This is to be done, no later than five years after the Regulations come into force, and subsequently at intervals of not more than five years.</p>
