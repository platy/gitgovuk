<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK trade preferences scheme - the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (<abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) - has been in place since 1 January 2021. <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> applies to imports of goods originating in least developed countries (<abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>) and other developing countries. Trade is an essential factor in economic growth which can trigger positive changes in a country’s economy, helping to raise incomes, create jobs and lift people out of poverty.</p>

<p>The new UK trade preferences scheme - the Developing Countries Trading Scheme (<abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr>) - has been developed in consultation with businesses, public sector bodies, civil society and the general public. The government conducted an 8-week <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations" rel="external">public consultation</a> from 12:15am on 19 July to 11:45pm on 12 September 2021. This document provides an overview of the responses received from the public consultation.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/designing-the-uk-trade-preferences-scheme-for-developing-nations">statement of direction</a> was published alongside the public consultation. It set out proposals that represented the considerations on which the government was inviting views for rules of origin (<abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr>), tariffs, goods graduation, and <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> conditions.</p>

<p>The government’s response to the public consultation is being published alongside this summary of the consultation. The government’s response includes its strategic approach and policy direction, which has been informed by the responses received through the public consultation.</p>

<h3>Policy objectives</h3>

<p>The overall objective of the policy changes is to increase trade with developing countries, thereby supporting their economic growth.</p>

<p>Policy changes have been guided by the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a simpler scheme for partner countries and businesses to understand and use</li>
  <li>a scheme that supports sustainable growth</li>
  <li>coherence with the UK’s trade policy ambitions to be a leader on trade for development</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> is relevant for countries that benefit under the UK’s existing&nbsp;<abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b">Annex B</a> for a list of <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries at the time of the public consultation.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trading-with-developing-nations">trading with developing nations</a> for current <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries.</p>

<h3>Overview of the current scheme</h3>

<p>The UK’s <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> provides similar access as the EU trade preferences scheme by granting duty-free, quota-free access to around 47 <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> and granting tariff reductions to other developing countries.</p>

<p>The government is changing the UK’s trade preferences scheme to improve access to the UK market for developing countries. Increasing trade with the UK contributes to developing countries’ integration into the global economy and helps create stronger trade and investment partners for the future and support supply chains.</p>

<p>The UK’s <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> has 3 frameworks.</p>

<h4>General Framework</h4>

<p>For low income countries (<abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr>) and lower middle income countries (<abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr>). They benefit from the full or partial removal of customs duties on two-thirds of tariff lines.</p>

<h4>Enhanced Framework</h4>

<p>For <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr> that also ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions. They benefit from the full removal of customs duties on two-thirds of tariff lines.</p>

<h4>Least Developed Country Framework</h4>

<p>For countries that are classified as <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> by the United Nations. They benefit from duty-free, quota-free access for all products except arms and ammunition.</p>

<h3>What we asked</h3>

<p>This consultation aimed to reflect the government’s commitment to consult and take into account the views of all sectors of society and international stakeholders. Through the consultation, we made it possible for UK and non-UK respondents to have their say on the UK’s approach to preferential market access for developing countries.</p>

<p>Respondents included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals</li>
  <li>non-governmental organisations (<abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>public sector bodies</li>
  <li>businesses and business associations</li>
  <li>other international governments</li>
</ul>

<p>The consultation offered respondents the opportunity to provide views on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simplifying <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> requirements for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>simplifying and reducing tariffs for <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr> in the Enhanced and General Frameworks</li>
  <li>reassessing the approach to goods graduation for countries in the General Framework</li>
  <li>reassessing some conditions of the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> applicable to all 3 frameworks, and those which specifically apply to the Enhanced Framework</li>
</ul>

<p>Respondents could provide their views by completing a GOV.UK consultation questionnaire and by submitting responses to the consultation email address. Respondents to the GOV.UK consultation questionnaire were given an option to include supplementary information as evidence, in addition to their completed questionnaire response.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK consultation questionnaire was divided into 4 sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr>, including product specific rules (<abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>tariffs</li>
  <li>goods graduation</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>A comprehensive list of all the questions asked as a part of this public consultation is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a">Annex A</a>. An information pack provided background and technical information on the UK’s <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> and wider trade policy, to help respondents complete the consultation questionnaire.</p>

<h3>What respondents told us</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr>, most respondents favoured increasing the permitted levels of non-originating content and the provisions for cumulation, which aligns with the policy direction indicated in the statement of direction. Opinions were more closely balanced between those favouring or opposing liberalisation of existing product specific provisions.</p>

<p>On tariffs, <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> already have duty-free, quota-free access to UK markets, but changes could be made for goods from <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr>. The general sentiment was in favour of reducing tariffs, which is in line with the UK’s broader policy goals of trade liberalisation. Some concerns were voiced about new tariff reductions eroding the current preferential margins that benefit <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> and, in some instances, countries in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>’s Enhanced Framework.</p>

<p>Protection of preference margins for less competitive goods from other developing countries was also cited as a reason for amending the current approach on goods graduation, which a majority of respondents supported.</p>

<p>Fewer than half of respondents opted to offer their view on the conditions which apply to all <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries and provide for circumstances where <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> access can be varied or suspended. Of those who responded, most thought the impact of these conditions was negative for exports and business. With regard to the conditions which enable eligible countries to benefit from the more generous preferences in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>’s Enhanced Framework, a clear majority of those who opted to respond were in favour of simpler requirements.</p>

<h3>This report</h3>

<p>This report provides a summary of the responses received through the public consultation process on the development and direction of the UK’s new trade preferences scheme.</p>

<p>This document does not contain a list of the respondents or contain any personal or organisational details of respondents. Views have been summarised in the following sections of this report but are not attributable to any individual respondent or business. The figures in this document refer to those who responded to the consultation and all responses are considered equally in the summary results to each question. Some respondents used identical or very similar wording as other respondents when answering some questions and we have noted such instances, where relevant. This does not affect the equal treatment of all responses in the summary results. A number of respondents raised points which fell outside the scope of this consultation. However, they have still been included as respondents in the statistical analysis.</p>

<p>To provide confidentiality, the government does not intend to publish any individual consultation responses it received. Some organisations have published their own responses independently.</p>

<p>This report does not set out government policy with respect to the new UK trade preferences policy, but the views provided in these responses have been carefully considered and analysed and the responses gathered have informed the development of government’s policy proposals.</p>

<h2>Consultation respondents</h2>

<p>As a result of this consultation the government received 300 responses, 280 of which were submitted via the GOV.UK consultation questionnaire and 20 to the consultation email address. Of the 280 responses to the GOV.UK consultation questionnaire, 19 included a document with their completed questionnaire response.</p>

<p>Respondents to the public consultation were self-categorised into the following 7 groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an individual - you are responding with your personal views, not as an official representative of any organisation</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="non-governmental organisation">NGO</abbr> - you are responding on behalf of an <abbr title="non-governmental organisation">NGO</abbr> (an organisation outside of the public sector set up not for purposes that are primarily to conduct business)</li>
  <li>public sector body - you are responding in an official capacity as a representative of a public body either in the UK or elsewhere (including devolved administration / local government organisation)</li>
  <li>business - you are responding in an official capacity with the views of an individual business</li>
  <li>business association - you are responding in an official capacity representing the views of a business organisation</li>
  <li>other - international government</li>
  <li>other - please specify</li>
</ul>

<p>Each individual submission from a respondent is treated equally in the figures presented throughout this document.</p>

<p>Business associations were required to respond to questions about the number of businesses represented, the average size of those businesses (number of employees) and the business area (sector) that the association represented. Businesses were given the option of providing information about their number of employees, their geographic location, the sector of their UK operations and whether they were an importer or exporter of goods. Those businesses could opt to specify the geographic region from which they imported or exported and whether they did so using <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> terms.</p>

<p>Public sector bodies and <abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr> were required to respond to a question about the (thematic) areas they represented. <abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr> could also opt to specify how many members their organisation represented.</p>

<h2>Summary of responses</h2>

<p>This section provides an aggregated overview of how respondents answered the questions in the GOV.UK consultation questionnaire. For the responses submitted to the consultation email address, where the views related to the issues covered in each sub-section of the questionnaire, a summary of those views is included in the respective sub-section.</p>

<h3>Simplifying <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> requirements for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>
</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This section gave respondents an opportunity to comment on GSP RoOs for LDCs, including cumulation provisions and PSRs.</p>

<p>RoOs determine where goods originate from and which goods can benefit from GSP tariff rates.</p>

<p>PSRs detail the criteria for sufficient processing or transformation where the good is made up of ‘non-originating’ materials or they define which goods can be considered eligible for GSP tariff rates if made exclusively from ‘originating’ materials.</p>
</div>

<p>When asked whether they were aware of the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> requirements before hearing about this consultation, a high proportion (229 of 279 questionnaire respondents) were already aware or somewhat aware. When asked in more detail, a lower proportion (162 of 280 respondents), but still a majority, were already aware or somewhat aware of cumulation possibilities.</p>

<p>As part of the proposed changes for <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr>, the statement of direction proposed simplifying <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> and extending cumulation for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The following themes were apparent in the questionnaire responses.</p>

<h4>Liberalisation of <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Almost two-thirds of respondents (177 of 280) offered an opinion about whether <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> should be simplified or liberalised.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> Of those who commented, slightly more supported the simplification and liberalisation of <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> (93 in favour and 84 against). Those respondents who were against thought it would provide <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> with an unfair advantage over <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr> (that is, in the General and Enhanced Frameworks). About one third of respondents (103 of 280) said they did not know whether <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> should be liberalised.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think the government should make the <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> more liberal for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>?</strong></p>

<h4>Increase of non-originating content</h4>

<p>Of those who commented on <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>, a majority of respondents favoured higher non-originating content. Those who were not in favour said that it gave <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> an unfair advantage over <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr>. Of these 84 responses, 44 were responses similar or identical to some other responses.</p>

<h4>Extending cumulation</h4>

<p>The majority of respondents (162 of 279) had a level of awareness about cumulation possibilities<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and most respondents (176 of 279) offered an opinion about whether cumulation should be extended. Of these respondents, the majority (117) supported extending cumulation for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>, to increase regional integration, support trade for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> or counteract the effects of countries signing free trade agreements (FTAs) and graduating from <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. Those who were not in favour (59) argued that relaxing both <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> and cumulation would provide an unfair advantage to <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> and adversely affect preference margins for <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Language and clarity</h4>

<p>Most respondents (192 of 274) thought that it was easy (148 responses) or relatively easy (44 responses) for traders to comply with the existing <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> requirements.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> Some commented that <abbr title="rules of origin">RoOs</abbr> could be made easier to understand, and the language used should be simplified. Some respondents also noted the complexity of understanding the different procedures in <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> and the difficulty of calculating value addition. Suggested improvements included the publication of the guidance in local languages, simplicity in the text and more support and training for exporters.</p>

<h4>EU REX</h4>

<p>Respondents took this opportunity to highlight issues following the UK’s departure from the EU REX systems and the challenges for the administrative requirements on goods coming via third countries.</p>

<h4>Other responses</h4>
<p>Of responses sent to the consultation email address, most were in favour of simplifying and liberalising <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr>. Suggestions included the need to increase non-originating content to increase utilisation rates, and the removal of double transformation rules, which were particularly challenging.</p>

<p>These respondents were also in favour of extending cumulation provisions for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>, primarily to support supply chains and encourage regional integration. Respondents provided feedback on cumulation possibilities with specific countries. Examples were UK <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> partners under duty free products, regional blocks such as African Caribbean and Pacific Group States (ACP), African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and other <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> beneficiaries. One respondent highlighted the need to extend cumulation possibilities particularly within the African region which is currently benefitting less in comparison with Asian <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries. One respondent was in favour of extending cumulation provisions for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> if this were further linked to labour standards.</p>

<p>In responses sent to the email address, those that were against the simplifications of <abbr title="product specific rules">PSRs</abbr> and extending cumulation for <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr> thought that it would cause preference erosion to Enhanced and General Framework countries and would distort the level playing field. All of these respondents were based in or traded with the General Framework or Enhanced Framework countries.</p>

<h3>Reducing tariffs for <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr>
</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This section gave respondents an opportunity to comment on possible amendments to the UK’s trade preferences scheme tariff schedules, including simplifying tariffs, extending coverage to more goods and providing greater tariff reductions.</p>
</div>

<p>When asked how aware respondents were of <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> tariffs prior to hearing about this consultation 54 said they were not aware (from a total of 275 respondents). Of these, 12 were individuals (from a total of 40 individuals) and 34 were businesses (from a total of 131 businesses).</p>

<h4>Coverage and depth</h4>

<p>Respondents were asked whether the government should make more goods from countries in the Enhanced Framework and/or General Framework eligible for preferential tariff reductions. There was support for tariff reductions (204 respondents in favour) and for offering greater tariff reductions on eligible&nbsp;goods from General Framework and Enhanced Framework countries (214&nbsp;respondents in favour).</p>

<p>Several respondents were opposed to making the&nbsp;General Framework more generous (these were largely respondents who used similar or identical wording to other respondents), arguing that only the <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr> with the most vulnerable economies should be eligible.</p>

<p>Forty five respondents chose to comment on specific products. Within these, respondents raised issues of&nbsp;preference erosion, on products such as sugar, cut flowers, bananas and canned fish and the importance of reducing tariff escalation to support value addition, on products such as cocoa.</p>

<h4>Nuisance tariffs</h4>

<p>When asked whether the government should set all <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> tariffs of 2% or less to zero, of 280 respondents, 136 respondents favoured removing all nuisance tariffs, with 76 opposed (mainly respondents using similar or identical language as other respondents). Those who opposed and provided comments highlighted the risks of eroding LDC and Enhanced Framework preferences.</p>

<h4>Seasonal tariffs</h4>

<p>Respondents were asked whether the government should simplify certain seasonal tariffs that apply to goods from countries in the Enhanced and/or General Framework. Of 198 responses, 171 favoured removal of all, plus 16 favouring removal of some. The few who were opposed gave reasons which included the need to protect existing preference margins for less developed and more vulnerable economies.</p>

<h4>Other responses</h4>

<p>Responses to the consultation email address did not address the issue of nuisance tariffs or seasonal tariffs.</p>

<h3>Amendments to the approach to goods graduation</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This section gave respondents an opportunity to comment on possible changes to the approach to goods graduation.</p>

<p>Goods graduation is the suspension of preferential rates of customs duty on certain imports following a goods graduation assessment. These imports are deemed highly competitive and to no longer need preferences to compete in the UK market. These imports cannot benefit from preferential rates and the UK Global Tariff applies instead. Suspension can be applied only to goods from countries in the General Framework.</p>
</div>

<p>When asked whether the government should amend its approach to goods graduation, of the 110 respondents, 75 agreed, 21 said they did not know and 14 said that the approach should not be amended.</p>

<p>Among respondents who thought the approach should be amended, common reasons were the importance of protecting the preference margins of less competitive countries and of UK businesses. Some respondents suggested the goods graduation process should only be applied to countries with a diversified export base and some respondents suggested assessments should consider the impact on workers in developing countries.</p>

<p>Of the respondents who said the approach should be amended, many thought the frequency of assessments should be increased. This included many similarly-worded responses arguing that the government should review the list of graduated goods at shorter intervals due to fast-changing trade dynamics. Of respondents who said the frequency of assessments should be reduced, some argued that developing countries need investment to bring their goods to a level at which they can enter the UK competitively. A longer time for graduation allows countries to make progress on issues such as value addition.</p>

<p>Respondents who said the current approach should not be amended argued that the existing groupings worked well and that being aligned with the EU preferences scheme contributed to ease of doing business. Other arguments included that <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> protected <abbr title="least developed countries">LDCs</abbr>’ interests, helped maintain their preferential margin and safeguarded their exports.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think the government should amend its approach to goods graduation?</strong></p>

<h4>Other responses</h4>

<p>Of responses to the consultation email address, only 4 included comments on goods graduation.</p>

<p>One respondent favoured maintaining the current approach on the grounds that it strikes the right balance between allowing time to address competitiveness issues and giving business predictability to plan their long lead time production. One respondent suggested that assessments should only be after 5 to 10 years. Three respondents suggested the current grouping of sectors should be amended, of whom one noted that changes could come with both benefits and risks. One respondent suggested the threshold should be reduced and total UK imports should be used to calculate the threshold.</p>

<h3>Amendments to conditions: general conditions for suspension of preferences</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The UK GSP has a set of conditions which apply to all GSP countries. The conditions provide for circumstances where GSP access can be varied or suspended. The government is considering potential simplification of the conditions that could lead to a suspension or variation of preferences for any GSP country.</p>
</div>

<p>156 respondents selected not to respond to questions on the conditions to suspend or vary preferences.</p>

<h4>Impact on exports</h4>

<p>One hundred and twenty four respondents opted to answer questions in this section of the questionnaire. When asked whether the conditions have an impact on exports from <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries, 106 provided a view, with 98 saying that conditions did influence exports. Fifty nine of these respondents thought the impact of conditions was negative, of whom 57 thought conditions should be reduced. Of respondents who said that conditions should be reduced, there were multiple identical comments that compliance procedures are overly cumbersome.</p>

<p>Fifteen respondents thought that conditions had a positive impact on exports. Of these, 11 supported conditions staying the same, and 4 favoured more conditions.</p>

<h4>Impact on business</h4>

<p>When asked whether the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> conditions had an impact on business,  91 respondents gave their view. Of these, 32 identified themselves as businesses and 59 identified themselves in another category.</p>

<p>Of respondents who identified themselves as businesses, 23 replied that the suspensive conditions have an impact on their business. Of these, 19 thought the impact was negative and conditions should be reduced (with 16 of these being similarly-worded responses). Nine respondents said that there was no impact on their business, of whom 5 favoured maintaining conditions.</p>

<p>Of respondents who identified themselves in a category other than businesses, 56 said that suspensive conditions had an impact on business. Twenty six thought the impact was negative and conditions should decrease. Twelve respondents thought that the impact was positive and conditions should stay the same. Only three non-business respondents thought the conditions have no impact.</p>

<h4>Impact on compliance with <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> obligations</h4>

<p>Respondents were asked whether the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> conditions have an impact on compliance with human and labour rights, good governance and sustainability obligations in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries.</p>

<p>Of the 95 respondents, 87 said that the conditions have an impact on compliance with human and labour rights, good governance and sustainability obligations in <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries. Of these respondents, 40 said that conditions should decrease, 29 said that conditions should stay the same, and 2 said that conditions should increase (a further 11 comments were not directly related to the question). There were multiple identical responses that conditions have some impact on compliance with <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> obligations, but rigid application without consideration of local context is counter-productive.</p>

<h4>Other responses</h4>

<p>In the 20 responses to the consultation email address, there was considerable variation in the level of detail in the comments provided. With regard to the general conditions, the predominant sentiment was that conditions should stay the same. Where specific conditions were mentioned, these related to human rights and labour rights.</p>

<h3>Amendments to conditions: Enhanced Framework</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The GSP Enhanced Framework provides more generous trade preferences (when compared with the General Framework) as an incentive to economically vulnerable countries to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions. The government is considering the conditions and reporting requirements of the Enhanced Framework.</p>
</div>

<p>There were 174 respondents to the question about whether the government should simplify the requirements that enable <abbr title="low income countries">LICs</abbr> and <abbr title="lower middle income countries">LMICs</abbr> to access the Enhanced Framework. Of these, 106 represented businesses or business associations, 23 were individuals, 10 represented an <abbr title="non-governmental organisation">NGO</abbr>, 18 represented a public sector body and 1 represented an international government. There were a further 16 respondents.</p>

<p>When asked whether the government should simplify the requirements, 149 respondents supported simplification, with the rationale that the current criteria were difficult for developing countries to meet and that simplifying the Enhanced Framework criteria would increase trade or make trade easier with participating countries.</p>

<p>There were similarly-worded responses about economically vulnerable countries being subjected to more requirements than those in the General Framework. These respondents argued that the additional trade preferences and the additional compliance requirements should be finely balanced.</p>

<p>Some similarly-worded responses suggested that the compliance mechanisms of the 27 UN Conventions and other eligibility criteria for qualification into the Enhanced Framework were difficult to comply with.</p>

<p>Twenty two respondents to the questionnaire thought the criteria should stay the same or increase.</p>

<p>Five questionnaire respondents thought the criteria should be simplified, but that conventions-based obligations should remain. Of those, 2 respondents suggested having clearer processes for <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries to follow. One respondent suggested a revision of the provision to ‘effectively implement’ the conventions, because it was not easy to determine effective implementation.</p>

<p>One respondent said the environmental conventions should be simplified to allow the time, funds, and technology adaption needed to achieve the requirements in the conventions. One respondent said there should be more conditions on sustainability and environmental protection. That same respondent also thought the government’s economic vulnerability criteria should be dropped, on the grounds that ratifying and effectively implementing the conventions was sufficient.</p>

<p>Very few of the 20 responses to the consultation email address referred to the Enhanced Framework criteria directly. Those that did favoured maintaining the current approach.</p>

<h3>Uploaded evidence</h3>

<p>At the end of the consultation questionnaire, respondents were given the option to upload documents as further evidence that the government might wish to consider. Nineteen of 280 respondents uploaded documents. Of these, 2 were individuals, 11 businesses or business associations, 1 <abbr title="non-governmental organisation">NGO</abbr>, 2 public sector bodies and 3 other.</p>

<p>Some uploaded material was about the respondent’s personal or business credentials or a particular experience they had had with the EU <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> system. Other respondents chose to expand on existing answers to the survey in more detail or propose a detailed case study on the <abbr title="Generalised Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> including complex analysis undertaken on behalf of their country, sector or business. Where possible, mention of these submitted documents has been included in the relevant sections above.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation which have informed the approach to the UK’s new trade preferences scheme for developing countries. Alongside this summary of response document, the government has published its response to the consultation. The government response includes its strategic approach and policy direction, which has been informed by the responses received through the public consultation.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for International Trade is responsible for the UK trade preferences scheme. Legislation will be drafted to bring the new UK trade preferences scheme into force in early 2023.</p>
