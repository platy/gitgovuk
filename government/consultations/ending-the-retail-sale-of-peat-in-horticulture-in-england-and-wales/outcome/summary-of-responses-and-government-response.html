<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>This document provides a summary or responses to the government’s consultation on proposals to end the sale of peat and peat containing products in England and Wales.</p>

<p>We asked for views on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>measures to end the use of peat and peat containing products in retail horticulture</li>
  <li>views on each of the proposed measures and how they could operate</li>
  <li>any evidence on the impacts of ending the use of peat and peat containing products in the professional horticulture and wider sectors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Policy background</h2>

<p>Peatlands are an iconic feature of our landscapes and the UK’s largest stores of carbon. They also provide vital ecosystem services including supplying UK drinking water, decreasing flood risk, and providing food and shelter for rare wildlife.</p>

<p>The extraction of peat releases the carbon stored inside as carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change. Peat is extracted in the UK for, primarily, horticultural purposes. By ending the retail sale of peat in horticulture, we will be protecting our vulnerable peatlands and helping to prevent climate change.</p>

<p>Peat has been commercially extracted for growing media since the 1970s. The modern commercial horticulture sector has been developed around the use of peat and its properties for plant growing. Peat for horticulture is extracted from lowland peats, predominantly from lowland raised bogs, which occur in flat, low-lying inland locations or basins. Commercial extraction in England is now only licenced on approximately 627 ha of peatland across 24 sites.</p>

<h3>Publication date and period of consultation</h3>

<p>The consultation was initially published on Saturday 18 December 2021, it was open for 12 weeks, and closed on Friday 18 March 2022.</p>

<h3>Why did we ask for views on this subject?</h3>

<p>Through one or more measures in the consultation, the intention was to seek views on ending the use of peat within the horticultural sector in England and Wales. The policy objective being to reduce to zero the unnecessary use of peat. This policy will contribute to the government’s net zero carbon emissions target.</p>

<h2>List of questions and summary of responses</h2>

<p>The consultation was submitted for public viewing and over the course of the 12-week consultation period there were 5,619 responses.</p>

<p>Open-ended questions were analysed and split into categories; some longer answers may have been included in multiple categories. The ‘n’ number used in this document represents the number of respondents that answered each question or part of each question.</p>

<h4>Are there industries other than the horticultural industry that will be severely affected by a ban of the retail sale of peat and peat containing products? [If ‘yes’] which industries?</h4>

<p>(Question 17 in the consultation)</p>

<p>There were only 308 responses that indicated that industries other than those in the horticultural sector would be severely affected by a retail sales ban on peat and peat containing products. Using the open-ended question these respondents identified the other impacted sectors as whisky and heating fuel. However, the majority of respondents 64% were ‘Unsure’ if other industries would be subject to change following a ban.</p>

<p>The open-ended section of this question gauged the responses(n=642) of respondents about exemptions to a ban. The two industries acknowledged in the comments were the whisky industry and the need for peat for fuel and heating.</p>

<h4>Should there be any exemptions from such a sales ban? (Please select all that apply.)</h4>

<p>(Question 18 in the consultation)</p>

<p>Approximately two-thirds (n=3698, 66%) of respondents thought that there should be no exemptions to a ban. Just under a third of respondents (n=1724, 31%) selected that there should be scientific exemptions to a ban, with 217 (4%) indicating that there should be exemptions for growing media for potted plants and shrubs.</p>

<p>The open-ended question to follow this one was answered by 2349 respondents and categorised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is no need to use peat – so no exemptions are needed 42%</li>
  <li>there should be exemptions for scientific use 25%</li>

  <li>a ban is dependent on import restrictions 0.08%</li>
</ul>

<h4>For potted plants and shrubs, what should be the maximum quantity of peat that should be exempt from a sales ban?</h4>

<p>(Question 19 in the consultation)</p>

<p>Around half of respondents (57%) selected the ‘Less than 1L of peat’ option and around one third of respondents (40%) selected the ‘No maximum’ option. The analysis of the open text comments (n=2540) show that 88% of respondents believe that there should be no peat allowed in potted plants and shrubs. As the number of respondents expressing that no peat should be allowed in potted plants and shrubs is greater than the number selecting either the ‘Less than 1L of peat’ and ‘No maximum’ option [or the two combined depending on the n for the open question] this can be interpreted to mean that the majority of respondents selecting either of these two options are expressing a preference for no exemption to the sales ban for peat used in potted plants and shrubs.</p>

However, almost a quarter of those providing additional comments (23%) expressed the view that peat sales should just be banned.</p>

Of the responses 13% (n=167) still believe that a price increase is unlikely to change anything, and a minority 1% think that this would price lower income gardeners out of the market.

<h2>Business respondents</h2>

<h4>Are you [responding on behalf of?] a business?</h4>

<p>(Question 5 in the consultation)</p>

<p>This question was designed to separate the consultees into two groups for further analysis, with those answering ‘Yes’ having to answer more questions regarding their business activities and their potential relationship with the horticulture sector. Most respondents (94.9%, n=5333) answered ‘No’ to this question with only 3.5% answering on behalf of a business. This is very close to the 3.5% that answered in question 1 as either a growing media manufacturer, retailer selling bagged growing media, a professional grower of horticulture or a peat extractor.</p>

<h2>Other responses from <abbr title="Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations">eNGOs</abbr> and commercial users of peat</h2>

<p>There were a number of coordinated responses to the consultation from industry bodies and from Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (<abbr title="Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations">eNGOs</abbr>). Where practicable these have been included into the responses detailed above. A number of responses that were not suitable for analysis in the responses above are being used to inform future decision making and to guide the policy direction.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and next steps</h2>

<p>We welcome the responses received to this consultation. The consultation has demonstrated that there is strong public support for introducing a ban on the sale of peat and peat containing products when compared to the other options and as such a ban on the sale of peat and peat containing products by the end of this parliament remains the preferred measure.</p>

<p>As a next step we will take forward discussions with the horticulture sector to understand better the technical barriers to replacing peat based growing media with suitable alternatives within the professional sector and to understand how exemptions from the proposed preferred measure can be implemented in respect of the professional horticulture sector.</p>

<p>This response details the analysis of the consultation responses. As this is a devolved matter respective policy positions will be published by Defra in respect of the policy position for England, and by the Welsh Government in respect of Wales.</p>
