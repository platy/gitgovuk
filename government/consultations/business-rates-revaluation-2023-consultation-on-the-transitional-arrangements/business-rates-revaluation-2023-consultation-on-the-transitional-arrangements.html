<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Business rates revaluations</h2>

<p>1. Business rates revaluations update rateable values, and therefore, rates bills to reflect changes in the rental market. This helps ensure that shifts in economic activity which have driven changes in market values are fairly reflected in business rates liabilities.</p>

<p>2. The final report of the government’s Review of Business Rates announced that the frequency of revaluations would be increased to 3 yearly starting from the next revaluation in 2023. The next revaluation of properties for business rates will, therefore, take effect from 1 April 2023 based on the rental market at 1 April 2021. The move to 3 yearly revaluations will make the system fairer and more responsive for all ratepayers, meaning bills will more closely reflect current rental values. Some stakeholders in the Business Rates Review also suggested that more frequent revaluations could reduce the need for and scope of future transitional arrangements.</p>

<p>3. It is too early to know the result of the 2023 revaluation. However, the government is required by law to introduce at each revaluation transitional arrangements which we have previously used to support businesses to adjust to their new bills. Therefore, this consultation seeks views on the format of the transitional arrangements for the 2023 revaluation. The government will then have regard to the responses to the consultation before deciding in the Autumn upon the transitional arrangements to be adopted once the revaluation outcomes are known.</p>

<p>4. The transitional arrangements are calculated based on changes in gross rates bills before changes to other reliefs. In the past the government has also introduced a separate relief scheme (called Supporting Small Business relief) to help those ratepayers losing other reliefs as a result of the revaluation. The government will separately consider whether to introduce a scheme such as Supporting Small Businesses in the Autumn of 2022 once the outcomes of the revaluation are known. Whether to introduce or continue other relief schemes, such the Supporting Small Business relief, is outside the scope of this consultation.</p>

<p>5. In July 2020 the government published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/903429/Business_Rates_Review_-_CfE.pdf" rel="external">Call for Evidence</a> as part of its review of business rates which, in part, sought views on the transitional arrangements scheme in the context of moving to more frequent revaluations. A summary of the responses to that in respect of the transitional arrangements was included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971681/Fundamental_Review_Interim_Report.pdf" rel="external">Interim Report</a> to the review (at paragraph 3.24 to 3.22).</p>

<p>6. Since their introduction in 1990, the format of the transitional arrangements have been designed to provide support to businesses facing increases in their bills. Consultations have considered different changes to the transitional arrangements with common considerations for each scheme but broadly speaking, only the level of support provided has varied following fiscal decisions made by the Exchequer. Therefore, the government will on conclusion of this consultation review whether continued consultations at future revaluations are necessary for the transitional arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The role of the transitional arrangements</h2>

<p>7. Revaluations serve an important role in the rating system by ensuring rates bills reflect the up to date value of properties. They, therefore, ensure everyone pays the correct and fair share of business rates.</p>

<p>8. For some ratepayers – broadly speaking those whose rental values have been falling in comparison to the national average – the revaluation will mean reductions in bills.  But inevitably other ratepayers – broadly speaking those whose rental values are doing better than the average – see their rate bills rise at the revaluation. The transitional arrangements have been used at previous revaluations to provide that these changes in bills are gradual and phased in over time.</p>

<p>9. By law the government are required to have a transitional arrangements scheme at each revaluation. That legislation also requires the government to have regard to the object of securing (so far as practicable) that the aggregate amount of business rates collected is unaffected by the transitional arrangements scheme.</p>

<p>10. Therefore, there is a trade-off in the design of the transitional arrangements between allowing the full impacts of the revaluation to feed through into rate bills quickly or dampening the effects of the revaluation over time. A more generous transitional arrangements scheme provides more support to those facing increases (i.e. those whose rental values have grown beyond the average) but means the effects of the revaluation are felt more slowly – so it takes longer for ratepayers to move to the right bills.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> how do you believe the government should strike the balance in the 2023 transitional arrangements between supporting ratepayers facing increases to their bills and allowing the effect of the revaluation to flow through into bills?</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Transitional relief</h2>

<p>11. Typically, the transitional arrangements have capped increases in bills due to the revaluation at a set percentage level each year – these caps on increases are known as “transitional relief”. Previous schemes have included different caps for different sizes of properties recognising that, generally speaking, occupiers of smaller properties are less likely to be able to manage large increases in their rates bills. For example, in 2017 the following caps on increases were adopted:</p>

<p><strong>Transitional Arrangements 2017 revaluation (before inflation) caps on increases (upwards cap)</strong></p>

<table>

      <td>16.00%</td>
      <td>6.00%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note: these are year on year caps on increases. For instance, the maximum increase for small properties over 5 years would be 64%. But a small property with an increase of 7% would reach their full bill in year 2.</p>

<p>Medium is above £28,000 rateable value in London and £20,000 elsewhere. Large above £100,000.</p>

<p>12. This type of transitional relief scheme gives all ratepayers a degree of certainty over their new bill. Ratepayers may still see their bill change for other reasons but it does provide a relatively simple assurance to ratepayers about the annual change in their bills due to the revaluation.  However, this type of transitional relief scheme does mean that all ratepayers (within size categories) see their increases capped at the same percentage irrespective of the underlying increase in their full rates bill.</p>

<p>13. Some practitioners have suggested the scheme should be redesigned so that all ratepayers reach their full bill by the end of the rating list irrespective of the size of increases that might involve. For the future three yearly rating cycle, such a scheme could take ratepayers to their full bill in even steps – i.e. paying one third of their increase in the first year, two thirds in the second year and their full bill in the third year. Under that approach, transitional relief would end after the 2nd year. This approach would ensure all ratepayers transition to their full bill within the life of the list. However, it also means that compared to most caps in previous ‘capped’ schemes, such an approach would provide less relief to those ratepayers most affected by the revaluation. It would also be more complicated than the previous schemes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> what format of transitional relief do you think should be provided for the 2023 revaluation?</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> do you think that we should continue to provide assurances through transitional relief that bills will not rise by more than a set percentage due to the revaluation?</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> do you think we should provide different caps for different sizes of properties?</p>
</div>

<p>14. The level of relief and the rateable value thresholds for the different levels of relief will be decided in the Autumn once the outcomes of the revaluation are known and is outside the scope of this consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Funding transitional relief</h2>

<p>15. When introducing a transitional relief scheme the government must have regard to the object of securing (so far as practicable) that the scheme is revenue neutral over its life.</p>

<p>16. To meet this requirement the government has at previous revaluations applied caps on reductions as well as on increases in bills. As with transitional relief, different caps on reductions have in the past been adopted for different sizes of properties.  For example, in 2017 the following caps on reductions were applied to bills:</p>

<p><strong>Transitional Arrangements 2017 revaluation (before inflation) caps on reductions (downwards cap)</strong></p>

      <td>25.00%</td>

      <td>4.10%</td>

</table>

<p>Note: these are year on year caps on increases.</p>

<p>Medium is above £28,000 rateable value in London and £20,000 elsewhere. Large above £100,000.</p>

<p>17. This approach ensures that those who are seeing the greatest reductions at the revaluation meet the cost of funding the transitional arrangements, recognising that those ratepayers are best placed to meet the cost – because they have seen a fall in their rates bill. However, this approach does also mean that the cost of transitional relief is met in large part by a relatively small number of ratepayers.</p>

<p>18. Alternatively, the government has previously considered meeting the cost of transitional relief by applying a supplement to the rate bills of other ratepayers. In effect this would mean an increase to the business rates multipliers - so some ratepayers would pay a higher multiplier to fund upwards transitional arrangements. The level of the supplement would depend on the outcomes of the revaluation and the cost of the transitional relief.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Question 5:</strong> what are you views on how we should fund transitional relief within the requirement for the government to have regard to the object of securing (so far as practicable) that the scheme is revenue neutral over its life?</p>

<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> do you have any other views on the format of the transitional arrangements for the 2023 revaluation?</p>

The relevant lawful basis for the processing of special category personal data is Article 9(2)(g) UK GDPR (‘substantial public interest’), and Schedule 1 paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (‘statutory etc and government purposes’). The relevant lawful basis in relation to personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences data is likewise provided by Schedule 1 paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
