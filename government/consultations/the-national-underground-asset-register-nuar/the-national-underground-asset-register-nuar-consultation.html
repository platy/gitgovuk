<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>In a rapidly advancing digital environment, location data is a strategic asset that brings immense value to our economy, society and environment. Each year, 4 million holes are dug (around 1 every 7 seconds) to install, fix and maintain the pipes and wires buried underground - assets that are critical in keeping the water running, gas and electricity flowing and our telecommunications lines connected. Approximately 1 in every 65 holes dug results in an accidental asset strike (c. 60,000 a year), causing around Â£2.4 billion worth of economic cost, putting workersâ lives at risk and disrupting our day-to-day lives. The National Underground Asset Register (NUAR) will help improve efficiencies in construction and development, reduce disruption (from extended road closures &amp; congestion), improve workersâ safety, and is envisaged to deliver Â£347m economic value per year.</p>

<p>Every construction and infrastructure project has to source information on underground assets (i.e. cables, pipes, sewers and ducts) when preparing ground investigation and excavation work. A significant number of organisations have to be contacted for information on their assets, and this is provided in varied formats, scales, quality, and on different timelines. With all these assets and different companies involved, working beneath the ground is both complex and time consuming.</p>

<p>In 2019, the Geospatial Commission launched its first set of activities with this industry through local, twelve month pilots. Focused in the North East of England and London, the pilots aimed to increase our understanding of how a national register could work in practice, as well as work with stakeholders to test what the mapping platform could look like. These pilots demonstrated the real world positive impacts NUAR would have for industry and society more widely, making ground works cheaper, safer and quicker.</p>

<p>The Geospatial Commission has a mandate to deliver changes to unlock the power of location data. Learning from the pilots, it is clear that improvements in sharing and accessing underground asset data have huge potential in revolutionising how infrastructure projects are planned and delivered, helping to improve efficiencies in construction and development, reduce disruption and improving workersâ safety. The improvements delivered are also likely to have value for new types of infrastructure projects including the rollout of fibre broadband and electric vehicle charge points, as well as potentially for other use cases such as coordination of streetworks, emergency response, flood risk planning, resilience planning and alternative energy production and distribution.</p>

<p>NUAR not only provides benefits to asset owners and those that dig up the streets, but also provides opportunities to the wider market. Delivering this project is a key priority for the Government and I want to thank everyone involved in supporting the Geospatial Commissionâs work to date to deliver NUAR. For all of those responding to this consultation, your responses will help guide the next steps taken in this important project.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>The Geospatial Commission is building a digital service for sharing data on the location of underground pipes and cables that will revolutionise construction and development in the UK - the National Underground Asset Register (NUAR). NUAR will provide a consistent, interactive, digital map of buried asset data, accessible when, where and how it is needed by those planning and executing excavations.</p>

<p>A key priority is to ensure NUAR is delivered in a manner that maximises value to users, with a sustainable funding model. To achieve this, full participation by owners of underground assets (âasset ownersâ) is preferable, to ensure planners and excavators have access to as complete data as possible.</p>

<p>For asset owners, this service will improve current data exchange processes leading to significant efficiencies and reducing the likelihood of asset strikes. Based on the pilots and our work to date, we expect the majority of asset owners will be keen to participate voluntarily. We are considering all options, including legislation, to ensure maximum participation in the platform and set the future home of NUAR.</p>

<p>This consultation is split into three sections and will ask questions throughout. The first section outlines the current practice. The following section details our assessment in regards to potential legislation and the scope of such legislation. The final section outlines our current thinking to date on the potential funding mechanism to support the ongoing service.</p>

<p>We are seeking the views of utility companies, local authorities, regulators, trade associations, professional bodies, other organisations operating in the infrastructure sector, academia and the wider public to help shape the future of NUAR.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>About the Geospatial Commission</h3>
<p>The Geospatial Commission was established in 2018 by the government as an independent, expert committee responsible for setting the UKâs geospatial strategy. Our aim is to unlock the significant economic, social and environmental opportunities offered by location data and boost the UKâs global geospatial expertise.
The Geospatial Commission has a mandate and budget to drive and deliver changes by working in partnership with others. This means we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide strategic oversight of the geospatial ecosystem in the UK, setting geospatial strategy, policy and standards.</li>
  <li>Hold the budget for the public sectorâs largest investment in geospatial data.</li>
  <li>Make targeted investments in data projects that accelerate innovation and adoption of geospatial data applications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>A significant proportion of our utility, building, and transport infrastructure is buried underground, including c. 4 million kilometres of buried pipes, cables, telecoms, and sewers <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. An estimated 4 million holes are dug every year to access buried utility networks for repairs, upgrades, and installations<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. This busy and often unseen environment suffers an estimated 60,000 utility strikes per year, leading to injury, project delays, and disruption to traffic and local economies. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-underground-asset-register-unlocking-value-for-industry-and-the-wider-economy/national-underground-asset-register-nuar-economic-case-summary">Accidental strikes on underground assets are estimated to cost Â£2.4bn a year in direct and indirect costs</a>. Whilst data on underground assets is freely available for certain groups, obtaining it requires contacting multiple sources, with the data provided in different formats, scales and to varying timeframes.</p>

<h3>About NUAR</h3>

<p>NUAR is a government-led programme aimed at more efficient information exchange by creating a single, comprehensive data-sharing platform on the location and condition of underground assets. It will be a secure data-sharing service that will provide an interactive, standardised digital view of the underground assets in a given location. The fundamental purpose of NUAR is to streamline the data-sharing process, reduce the risk of potentially lethal utility asset strikes and promote more efficient management and maintenance of underground assets.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The expected benefits of NUAR consists of three components:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Savings from reduced utility strikes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced costs and improved efficiency of data sharing; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-site and back office efficiency improvements for projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These benefits are estimated to be c. Â£347m per annum in real terms.</p>
</div>

<h3>Activity currently underway</h3>
<p>As NUAR is a live three-year programme, we have already undertaken some key steps to help unlock its full potential. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/next-phase-of-government-project-to-map-the-uks-underground-pipes-and-cables-launched">In September 2021 we appointed a supplier, and work commenced on the build phase of the service</a>. This is focused on the development of the digital service and is being built in partnership with industry over the next three years. Starting in North East England, Wales and London, it will complete with Northern Ireland and the remainder of England by Autumn 2024<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. To support this, data sharing agreements have started to be signed between asset owners and the supplier which will allow us to begin transforming the data and load it onto the platform.</p>

<p>We have also now developed a new enduring legal framework for data publication, outlining what data on NUAR can be accessed for. This is a key step in ensuring NUAR can be rolled out nationally.</p>

<h2>Section 1 - The case for NUAR</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Current practice</h3>

<p>Current legislation, principally the New Roads and Street Works Act (1991), sets out the requirements in regards to data sharing relating to underground assets. Asset owners must make their data available to certain companies or agencies undertaking work around the highway network (known as statutory undertakers) free of charge. Some asset owners may also provide underground asset data to other organisations for non-statutory purposes, such as for surveying and conveyancing requests, though there are no legal obligations to share such data. This service may be provided at a cost to the requestor.</p>

<p>There is currently no fully digital platform in the UK that allows complete access to all data related to underground assets in one place. Rather, each asset owner holds the information relating to their assets and provides access to this when required in order to support safe working.</p>

<p>This process is time consuming for both asset owners, who are supplying the data, and for infrastructure project planners, who need access to the data. For asset owners to comply with existing legislation, they make their data available through multiple channels to respond to multiple requests. For project planners, they must contact all relevant asset owners to confirm underground apparatus in a given area, wait for this information and then bring it together.</p>

<p>There are a limited number of existing search providers that offer a useful service, by managing queries regarding underground assets in partnership or on behalf of asset owners. These platforms are incomplete and do not provide access to the data in a standardised, immediate and digitally interactive format.</p>

<p>On site, the situation can be unsafe as lack of access to comprehensive and standardised information may cause workers to dig through live cables and pipes with risk of serious injury or death. Furthermore, finding unknown buried infrastructure whilst digging or accidentally striking through a pipe or cable can cause unnecessary project delays and adversely impact local residents and businesses.</p>

<p>With an estimated 60,000 asset strikes per year, costing an estimated Â£2.4bn, as well as additional costs for data sharing and project planning, it becomes clear significant improvements could be made to the current process.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q1: Approximately how much does it cost your organisation to provide data on the location of underground assets each month</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail to your answer, including time requirements, number and type of staff involved, and any other impacts.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q2: Approximately how many organisations do you contact in order to get access to a complete dataset of underground infrastructure on average per project?</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail to your answer including the number and type of staff involved.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q3: Approximately how long (in hours or days) on average does it take to receive all the data on the location of underground infrastructure you require from asset owners following the initial request?</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail to your answer.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q4: Once received, approximately how long (in hours or days) does it take you to process the data from the various sources into a useful standardised format or information pack for use on a job?</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail to your answer, including the method you use, and the number and type of staff involved.</p>
</div>

<h2>Section 2 - Assessing the need for legislation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Potential for legislation</h3>

<p>We are considering how best to ensure that the NUAR platform can most effectively provide organisations and workers with access to all the data they need, when they need it, to carry out their duties effectively and safely. During the current phase of the project, data distribution agreements are being sought with asset owners, allowing for the publication of their underground asset data on the NUAR platform.</p>

<p>As part of considering options, we are also exploring whether powers in legislation would help guarantee the full participation of asset owners, given that currently engagement with the platform is non compulsory. 100% participation would eliminate the risk of individual asset owners using NUAR, but not sharing their own data in return which was identified as a key concern of asset owners during the pilots. We might also require provisions through legislation to establish the long-term home for NUAR.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q5: Do you believe 100% participation is achievable without legislation?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes/No</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail to your answer, including how you think full participation could be achieved through other means.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Scope of legislation</h3>

<p>Itâs important that we also consider the powers and duties that would need to form part of any legislation implementing NUAR, so that, following consideration of the responses to this consultation, we can make informed proposals that would give the best effect to NUAR.</p>

<p>Lessons learnt from the pilots have shown that consistent data types and formats ensure the service will be of most use. As part of the current build phase, a data model has been developed, in collaboration with industry and standards bodies, which will ensure data viewed on NUAR is in a standardised and consistent format. To support this, a data transformation service will be provided, which ensures data held by asset owners can be ingested onto the platform. This service is provided free of charge in the current phase to minimise the cost of changes from legacy systems.</p>

<p>A standard model is of great benefit to end users, who will be able to quickly understand the underground assets in the area they are interested in. It will also support improved data quality at source, by reporting on compliance and conformance against the data model within the NUAR service. A feedback feature will also be provided to ensure that where inaccuracies do come to light, asset owners are informed and can take action appropriately.</p>

<p>Over time, our intention is to maintain a data model to ensure data being ingested onto the NUAR platform remains consistent and compliant.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q6: To what extent do you agree that the government should require data ingested into the platform to be consistent with the data model?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Strongly Agree/ Agree/ Neutral/ Disagree/ Strongly Disagree</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail to your answer.</p>
</div>

<p>NUAR is a service which is designed to benefit, rather than compete with, the market. There are opportunities for not just those who directly benefit from NUAR, but also for those who can add value on top of it. There is also clear potential for the same data to be used to unlock barriers to other high priority infrastructure projects such as electric vehicle charge points and fibre broadband rollout, as well as other use cases such as coordination of streetworks, emergency response, flood risk planning, resilience planning and alternative energy production and distribution. Once the NUAR platform is functioning effectively, we could expand the use cases for the data held on NUAR in the future, with appropriate prior consultation, and thus extend the end users of NUAR, for such purposes. In order to do so, we would need to build the necessary functionality into the platform at the outset.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q7. Do you agree that it could be beneficial to expand the prescribed use cases for NUAR in the future?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes/No</strong></p>

<p>There are numerous considerations for where the final home of NUAR should be and we remain open as to what the most appropriate option would be. This may be set out in legislation, allowing the establishment of a new body should it be required, or inclusion with an existing organisationâs expanded remit and responsibilities.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Q8. Do you have any views about how NUAR should be run once it is fully operational including the status and remit of the responsible body?</strong></p>

<p>Please provide any further detail on your response.</p>

<h2>Section 3 - Accessing NUAR</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>  A sustainable operating model</h3>

<p>Once established, to ensure the NUAR service remains of highest value and continues to provide a worthwhile service, a sustainable funding mechanism will be required. We are currently exploring a number of options to ensure the core provision of the NUAR service is funded in a sustainable manner. Our thinking to date takes into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current costs of meeting existing statutory duties for provision of underground asset data;</li>
  <li>Who are the beneficiaries of NUAR;</li>
  <li>How we ensure NUAR is adopted as widely as possible;</li>
  <li>Different fee models and their respective merits;</li>
</ul>

<p>Current statute requires that asset owners must provide their data free of charge,  âfor inspectionâ to statutory undertakers. This is done at cost to the asset owners who must respond to these requests for information. NUAR will provide a means for asset owners to efficiently meet their obligations without needing to respond to multiple requests.</p>

<p>For statutory undertakers, NUAR would be a âone-stop shopâ for information regarding underground assets meaning they would no longer need to contact multiple services and organisations to source the data. Additionally, the information on NUAR regarding the different types of underground assets would be in line with the data model meaning information provided would be of a consistent format.</p>

<p>The above would also be the case for access to NUAR for non-statutory purposes. Some asset owners do share their data with other third parties for a number of reasons, sometimes at cost to the requestor. Should the data on NUAR also be available for such purposes, a fee could also be levied.</p>

<p>Our intention would be to charge a fee to support the future running of NUAR given the anticipated benefits, and there are multiple options as to where this fee could be charged.</p>
