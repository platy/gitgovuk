<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>I am pleased that the Prime Minister has asked me to undertake an independent review into the connectivity of the United Kingdom (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is the oldest and most successful partnership of nations in history and, as connectivity drives the economy, jobs, housing and social cohesion, it is essential in ensuring that everyone feels the benefits of being part of this union.</p>

<p>The government has set out its commitment to levelling up by addressing the causes of regional inequality across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. The causes of inequality are complex and historic, and require long-term and well thought out policy decisions to resolve. This becomes even more important in the context of external economic impacts such as COVID-19 and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s departure from the European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>).</p>

<p>Transport alone cannot resolve these issues, but it is the most effective enabler of an effective growth strategy. The ability to move people and goods across the country is vital to the success of business, the growth of regional economies, and access for people to jobs, housing, education and health services, so good transport connections are needed to ensure that regions across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> are able to maximise their potential.</p>

<p>Much recent transport investment has been the result of an appraisal methodology that prioritises large numbers of travellers saving time spent on travel; naturally favouring travel to and from major conurbations. However, this review is about – and I am interested in – what can be done to invest in and widen the benefits of growth and cohesion across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Schemes such as High Speed 2 (<abbr title="High Speed 2">HS2</abbr>) and Northern Powerhouse Rail will deliver transport investment in the North and the Midlands, but this review will consider what more can be done to support all parts of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>I am delighted to publish this call for evidence to inform my review. It provides an opportunity to canvas the views of stakeholders on what needs to be done, and to provide evidence on transport connectivity, to ensure that all 4 nations and regions are able to maximise the economic, cultural and social benefits of being part of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Hendy <abbr title="Commander of the British Empire">CBE</abbr></p>

<h3>Crown copyright</h3>

<p>This consultation is covered by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/" class="govuk-link">rules of Crown copyright</a>, which the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>, <abbr title="union connectivity review">UCR</abbr> and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> government adhere to.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The union connectivity review (<abbr title="union connectivity review">UCR</abbr>) will provide independent advice to the government. It will provide an overview of how connectivity between the nations of the United Kingdom can support economic growth and improve quality of life.</p>

<p>It will focus on transport’s ability to maximise economic potential and to improve quality of life, and will outline a series of specific recommendations that will individually and collectively contribute to this outcome.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/union-connectivity-review-terms-of-reference">terms of reference for the <abbr title="union connectivity review">UCR</abbr> were published on 5 October 2020</a> and require it to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quality and reliability of major connections across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>likely current and future demand for transport links</li>
  <li>the environmental impact of policy options (including with regard to climate change)</li>
  <li>existing work completed by the government on cross-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> connectivity</li>
</ul>

<p>In carrying out this study, the government asked Sir Peter to consult widely with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>industry</li>
  <li>the general public</li>
  <li>relevant government agencies, including the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) and its modal teams, Scotland Office, Wales Office, Northern Ireland Office and the National Infrastructure Commission</li>
  <li>the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, local authorities and their infrastructure commissions</li>
</ul>

<p>This call for evidence is the first opportunity for individuals and organisations to provide detailed information on the need for additional connectivity between the nations of the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>About the call for evidence</h2>

<p>This call for evidence provides an opportunity for individuals and organisations to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>direct the review’s attention to areas in which multi-nation journeys within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> have the potential to be improved</li>
  <li>identify the importance of transport connectivity more generally</li>
  <li>set out strategic opportunities for improvements in cross-border transport</li>
</ul>

<p>It seeks information on the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importance of cross-border transport links to existing growth strategies</li>
  <li>appraisal methodologies and how these can support investment in cross-border transport</li>
  <li>specific journeys with the potential for improvement, and the cost and feasibility of these</li>
  <li>the potential development of a pan-<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> strategic transport network</li>
  <li>non-physical changes to support cross-border connectivity such as service provision or financial support</li>
  <li>the social and environmental impact of additional or improved transport links</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s ability to deliver a truly national transport strategy</li>
  <li>the feasibility and need for a fixed link between Northern Ireland and Great Britain</li>
  <li>any other relevant information</li>
</ul>

<p>The scope of this review includes all cross-border journeys – meaning those journeys that start and end within different nations of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Potential improvements or changes to transport links at any point on these journeys are in scope of the review and this call for evidence. Further information on this can be found in the supporting information after each of the <a href="#questions" class="govuk-link">consultation questions</a>.</p>

<p>This call for evidence is part of a wider review of information and evidence gathering. Information from a variety of sources will form part of a wider understanding of cross-border transport connectivity and will begin to identify areas for further examination.</p>

<p>The intention is to deliver an interim report in January 2021 and a final report setting out recommendations in summer 2021.</p>

<h2>Consultation questions</h2>
