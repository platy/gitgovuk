<h2>Section 1: Overview of this consultation</h2>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>1.1 This consultation seeks your views on the matters it is proposed will be introduced by a new Statutory Instrument, the Merchant Shipping (Cargo and Passenger Ship Construction and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2022 (“the proposed Regulations”). The proposed Regulations will amend the Merchant Shipping (Cargo Ship Construction) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1509) and the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ship Construction: Ships of Classes I, II and II(A)) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/2514) so as to implement the up to date requirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (“SOLAS”) relating to ship construction, contained in Chapter II-1 of the Annex to SOLAS (Structure, subdivision and stability, machinery and electrical installations) (“Chapter II-1”).</p>

<p>1.2 The main objective of the proposed Regulations is to enhance the safety standards for ship construction. The proposed Regulations will also include an ambulatory reference provision to ensure that future amendments to Chapter II-1 referred to in the proposed Regulations are given direct effect in UK law.</p>

<p>1.3 The updated requirements to Chapter II-1 agreed in the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), and which the proposed Regulations seek to implement, include amendments in respect of the requirements both for ships constructed before 1 January 2009 and ships constructed on or after 1 January 2009.</p>

<p>1.4 Further details on all the updates being implemented by the proposed Regulations  can be found in section 2.6.</p>

<h3>Views sought</h3>

<p>1.5 Consultees are invited to comment on any aspect of this consultation; however, you are specifically invited to respond to the consultation questions in section 5.1. A more in-depth explanation of the areas for consideration can be found in section 2.</p>

<p>1.6 A full list of consultation questions is contained in section 5 of this document.</p>

<h3>Deadline for responses</h3>

<p>1.7 Responses are welcomed from 15 August to 10 October 2022.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Areas for consideration</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>2.1 Chapter II-1 sets out the requirements governing the construction of ships – structure, subdivision and stability, machinery and electrical installations.  This includes, for example, watertight and weathertight integrity, stability management, and alternative design and arrangements and other requirements which are specific to particular situations. Chapter II-1 is supplemented by, and gives effect to, the International Code on Intact Stability, the International Goal-Based Ship Construction Standards for Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, the Code on Noise Levels on Board Ships, and the International Code of Safety for Ships using Gases or other Low-Flashpoint Fuels.</p>

<p>Amendments contained in 23 Resolutions have been agreed in the IMO since 1998 to further improve the standards for ship construction but which have not yet been implemented into UK law. The UK supported these amendments during IMO discussions and, as a party to SOLAS, the UK now has an obligation to implement these updates.</p>

<h3>Proposed changes</h3>

<p>2.2 The purpose of the IMO amendments is to maintain a high standard of safety and to remove barriers to trade by ensuring a consistent standard of ship construction</p>

<p>2.3 The following IMO Resolutions would be implemented in the proposed Regulations:</p>

</p></div></div>

<p>2.2 These updates will be implemented in the proposed Regulations.</p>

<p>2.3 The proposed Regulations will amend the existing statutory instruments which last implemented Chapter II-1 requirements - the Merchant Shipping (Cargo Ship Construction) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1509) and the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ship Construction: Ships of Classes I, II and II(A)) Regulations) 1998 (SI 1998/2514) (“the 1998 Regulations”). These existing instruments are being amended so that they will cease to apply to SOLAS ships (subject to a limited exception for certain requirements in the 1998 Regulations relating to recording of matters including, but not limited to, the times when watertight doors are closed); thus, both existing regulations will only apply to ships operating domestically. Correspondingly, the Merchant Shipping (Cargo and Passenger Ship Construction and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2022 will only apply to SOLAS ships.</p>

<p>2.4  The amendments to Chapter II-1 relating to ship construction comprise a mix of updates, clarifications and improvements to layout, as well as several important substantive changes to the safety measures. These substantive changes are listed above in paragraph 2.3.</p>

<p>2.5  The proposed Regulations include an ambulatory reference provision. This is a reference in domestic legislation to an international instrument (or part of it) which is interpreted as a reference to the international instrument as modified from time to time (and not simply the version of the instrument that exists at the time the domestic legislation is made). From a legal perspective, this will mean that any new amendments to Chapter II-1, and other Chapters of SOLAS that are referenced in the domestic implementing legislation, will automatically be given effect in UK law when they enter into force internationally. No new or amending regulations will be required to bring these amendments into force in the UK, as is currently the case. From a practical perspective, this means that ship owners, shipbuilders and other interested parties can refer directly to the text of Chapter II-1 to determine both the domestic and international requirements. Where the international text is unclear or needs amplification - for instance, where it provides that something is required to be done “to the satisfaction of the Administration” - guidance as to how that requirement could be fulfilled is contained in draft MGN 670.</p>

<h3>Application of the Regulations</h3>

<p>2.6 The proposed Regulations apply to all passenger vessels on international voyages and all cargo vessels of 500GT and over on international voyages, with some limited exceptions.</p>

<h3>Summary of Options and Recommendation</h3>

<p>2.7 An impact assessment (IA) has been produced for this proposal. Due to the nature of the changes, the lack of evidence, and the expected fairly low overall impact, it has not been proportionate to quantify the impacts. Instead, the IA provides a detailed qualitative description of the key changes and a justification for not quantifying the minor changes.</p>

<p>2.8 The following options were considered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Option 0. Do nothing.</b> This option is not viable as it would mean UK flagged vessels would have a lower standard of construction safety requirements than their international counterparts and would also be in contravention of the UK’s international obligations, agreed in the IMO. The existing rules for ship construction are implemented in the Merchant Shipping (Cargo Ship Construction) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1509) and the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ship Construction: Ships of Classes I, II and II(A) Regulations 1998 (SI 1998/2514). Chapter II-1 has been regularly updated in the intervening time since the legislation was last updated, with substantial changes taking effect on 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2020. As such, the UK regulations are over 20 years out of date in some places.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Option 1. Amend SI 1997/1509 and SI 1998/2514 without including an Ambulatory Reference provision for future amendments.</b> This option will provide a greater standard of safety to vessels and seafarers on UK and foreign vessels operating in UK waters, and will ensure that the UK’s implementation of the amendments to Chapter II-1 is brought up to date. However, the legislation will soon become out of date as further changes to Chapter II-1 are agreed by the IMO and enter into force. There will therefore be a need to undertake a review of the legislation again to ensure that it is kept up to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Option 2. Amend SI 1997/1509 and SI 1998/2514 including an ambulatory reference provision.</b> As with Option 1, this option will also satisfy the UK’s obligations as a signatory to SOLAS and bring UK legislation up-to-date and in line with its international counterparts. The inclusion of an ambulatory reference provision will enable UK industry to refer to the most up-to-date international legislation in this area (where referenced in the Regulations) and ensure that the Regulations remain up to date with the requirements for ship construction in SOLAS. Supporting documentation will be provided by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to add clarification and additional guidance where the regulations are or could be ambiguous, especially where the international text is open, as required e.g.: where Chapter II-1 provides that an obligation must be fulfilled “to the satisfaction of the Administration”, the MCA will describe what is expected to be done to meet this obligation. This will mainly fall on internationally operated vessels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is worthwhile noting that whilst the UK Chamber of Shipping advocates ‘ambulatory references’, this does not negate the Government’s principle of consultation. Amendments to international Conventions are developed and agreed at the IMO, where in addition to Member States, industry is well represented. Industry is therefore heavily involved with policy development and also in helping to shape the UK’s negotiating position. Working in partnership, UK officials and industry actively contribute to negotiations on new initiatives to ensure they are appropriate and proportionate measures to improve safety. However, the Government continues to commit to updating Parliament via a written ministerial statement if the ambulatory referencing powers are used to update or change the legislation.</p>

<p>We have discounted non-regulatory alternatives, as this would not be an effective means of ensuring ship construction standards in a global industry. Neither would it satisfy our obligation as a Party to SOLAS Chapter II-1 to implement and enforce these international requirements.</p>

<p>2.9 The preferred option is <b>Option 2</b></p>

<h3>Supporting Information</h3>

<p>2.10 Marine Notice:</p>

<p>2.11 It is intended to publish two Merchant Shipping Notices (MSN 1907 and MSN 1698 Amendment 1) and two Marine Guidance Notes (MGN 670 and 671) to support the proposed Regulations (included as Annexes B – E in the consultation documents).</p>

<p>2.12 Ships built before 1 January 2009 engaged on international voyages are required to comply with the requirements set out in the Annex to MSN 1907. The legislation which applies those requirements to such ships is outside the scope of the ambulatory reference provision with the exception of two requirements which apply to “all ships” (i.e. ships regardless of their date of construction).</p>

<p>2.13 Ships built on or after 1 January 2009 engaged on international voyages must comply with the provisions of Chapter II-1 applicable to such ships, as amended from time to time. Such amendments will be incorporated into UK law by virtue of the ambulatory reference provision.</p>

<p>2.14 It is not intended that the proposed Regulations will change the existing requirements for domestic ships. It is therefore necessary to amend Merchant Shipping Notice (MSN) 1698 only to remove those references in it to ships of Classes I and II so that the requirements in the MSN continue to only apply to ships of Class II(A), with requirements for Class I and II ships built before 1 January 2009 being contained in MSN 1907.</p>

<p>2.15 Although the proposed Regulations also amend the Merchant Shipping (Cargo Ship Construction) Regulations 1997, no parallel amendments have been identified that require a similar approach to be taken in respect of MSN 1671 (as amended).</p>

<p>2.16 Chapter II-1 contains a number of provisions in which there is reference to technical requirements that are required to be done “to the satisfaction of the Administration”, or otherwise require Administration approval. The intention of MGN 670 is to provide guidance in relation to such requirements in Chapter II-1. The guidance provided is not exhaustive and may be subject to future amendment.</p>

<p>2.17 As a part of the consolidation of, and introduction of ambulatory referencing in relation to Chapter II-1, the provisions in Annexes I and III to MSN 1715 (as amended by MSN 1715 Amendment 1), containing the subdivision and stability requirements for specified cargo ships, have been incorporated into Part B-1 in the Annex to MSN 1907 which sets out those requirements applicable to cargo ships constructed before 1 January 2009. The Explanatory Notes in Annex II to MSN 1715 are applicable in relation to those requirements and are therefore reproduced in the Annex in MGN 671. As a result, MSN 1715 is therefore withdrawn.</p>

<p>2.18 Offences and Penalties</p>

<p>2.19 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), as the UK’s maritime regulatory and enforcement authority, has responsibility for both delivering and enforcing the Government’s maritime policy relating to ships, seafarers and the seas around the UK. The MCA’s approach to breaches of maritime legislation relies on a range of civil and criminal remedies which, like in many other regulatory regimes in the UK, sit alongside each other to enable the MCA to take the most proportionate action in relation to a particular breach. The decision on what is the most proportionate approach is determined by matters such as the importance of the requirement being breached, the gravity of the contravention, the effect of the contravention on third parties etc.</p>

<p>2.20 MCA surveyors have enforcement and sanction powers which can be applied locally to ships calling at UK ports. The MCA’s powers to use civil sanctions are primarily contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (“the Act”). These powers, including improvement and prohibition notices, are available only for specific purposes. Other than the power to detain a ship, it is not possible to replicate all the civil sanctions in the Act in secondary legislation implementing international obligations or other policy objectives as there is no power to do so in the Act. Because these civil sanctions are contained in primary legislation, if they are needed, the sanctions will be enforced directly under the Act. The general policy approach, in line with the MCA’s published enforcement policy, is to use these civil sanctions whenever possible before using criminal offences.</p>

<p>2.21 Maritime regulatory requirements govern both safety and pollution prevention. As such, their purpose includes the prevention of loss of life or injury to persons and the protection of the marine environment and adjoining coastlines. These very compelling objectives necessitate the availability of criminal sanctions in the more serious cases, and also provide a vital deterrent. To this end, criminal offences are included in the proposed Regulations.</p>

<p>2.22. The opportunity has been taken to review the offences in relation to Chapter II-1. This included the target parties for each offence. The penalties themselves have also been reviewed. It is considered that all existing offences are still required, as they are still necessary as a deterrent and a proportionate means of achieving the necessary end, but no new offences are necessary.</p>

<p>2.23 The vast majority of the offences relate to requirements imposed on the owner and master. In each case, it is a defence for a person charged with an offence to prove that the person charged took all reasonable steps to avoid the commission of the offence. A small number of offences relate to requirements imposed only on the master. The same defence is available in such cases.</p>

<p>2.24 The offences are detailed in the table below:</p>
