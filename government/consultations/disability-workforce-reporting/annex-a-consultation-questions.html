<h3>Section A: Understanding the current landscape</h3>

<p>We want to understand how and what information is currently collected by employers on disability in the workforce, the impact to business, and the behaviours it causes.</p>

<h4>If yes</h4>

<p>How long has your organisation collected this information for?</p>

<p>Do you know if  your organisation uses the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/voluntary-reporting-on-disability-mental-health-and-wellbeing">disability voluntary reporting framework</a>?</p>

<h3>Section B: Benefits and barriers to disability workforce reporting</h3>

<p>This section seeks to better understand perceived benefits and risks involved in disability workforce reporting, both voluntary and mandatory.</p>

<p>Please explain and provide evidence for your answers where possible.</p>

<p>Do you think that greater transparency on disability in the workforce leads to more inclusive practices?</p>

<p>Please explain and provide evidence where possible.</p>

<p>Do you think that disability workforce reporting by large employers (250 or more employees) should be voluntary or mandatory?</p>

<p>What do you think the main benefits of a voluntary approach to disability workforce reporting are?</p>

<p>What do you think the main risks are?</p>

<p>The research available indicates low uptake of the disability voluntary reporting framework. How could voluntary reporting be increased?</p>

<p>What do you think the main benefits of a mandatory approach to disability workforce reporting are?</p>

<p>What do you think the main risks are?</p>

<p>What do you think the main benefits of publishing disability workforce information are?</p>

<p>What do you think the main risks are?</p>

<h3>Section C: Considerations if mandatory disability workforce reporting were to be implemented</h3>

<p>This section explores issues requiring careful consideration if disability workforce reporting were to be made mandatory through legislation. 
The information you provide here will be considered in the broader context of answers to sections A and B, where you were asked to set out the benefits and risks of voluntary and mandatory reporting processes.</p>

<p>Disability workforce reporting is intended to increase transparency and the recruitment, retention and progression of disabled people. Do you agree or disagree that the proportion of employees identifying as disabled is a useful statistic to report on?</p>

<p>Please explain your answer.</p>

<p>What, if any, statistic could be reported alongside or instead of the proportion of employees identifying as disabled? Please explain.</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree that large employers (250 or more employees) should use a standardised approach to collect disability workforce data if reporting became mandatory?</p>

<p>Please explain your answer.</p>

<p>There are many ways that people are asked to self-identify as disabled. If large employers were to use a standardised approach to data collection, which wording do you think should be used to ask employees if they identify as disabled?</p>

<p>What could support large employers to implement disability workforce reporting in consistent and effective ways? For example, would tools or guidance help consistency across organisations and sectors, and if so what could this look like.</p>

<p>If large employers were required to collect disability workforce information and report it to another organisation, which organisation do you think they should report to?</p>

<p>Should large employers publish organisation-level disability workforce statistics? For example, the proportion of their workforce identifying as disabled.</p>

<p>If published, who do you think should publish this information?</p>

<h3>Section D: Alternative approaches</h3>

<p>Mandatory workforce reporting is one means to increase transparency on disability in the workforce, with the aim to improve information and achieve more inclusive practices. We are interested to hear your views on other initiatives that might have the same outcomes.</p>

<p>What alternative approaches would you suggest to increase transparency, inclusion and employment of disabled people in the workplace? If you have any evidence to support this suggestion, please provide it.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Employee perspectives</h2>

<p>We welcome contributions from all interested parties from an employee perspective in this section. We are particularly interested in hearing from disabled people, disabled people led organisations, disability staff networks, and trade unions.</p>

<p>There is a duty on public authorities to consider or think about how their policies or decisions affect people who are protected under the Equality Act 2010. In responding to this consultation, please highlight any equalities impacts across protected characteristics in your answers.</p>

<h3>Section A: Understanding the current landscape</h3>

<p>We want to understand how and what information is currently collected by employers on disability in the workforce, and the behaviours it causes.</p>

<p>Does your current or did your previous employer collect information on the proportion of disabled people in their workforce?</p>

<h4>If yes</h4>

<p>What information does your employer collect?</p>

<h4>If no or unsure</h4>

<p>Do you agree or disagree that employers should collect disability workforce data?</p>

<p>Please explain your answer and provide evidence where possible.</p>

<p>Do you think that disability workforce reporting by large employers (250 or more employees) should be voluntary or mandatory?</p>

<p>What do you think the main benefits of a voluntary approach to disability workforce reporting are?</p>

<p>What do you think the main risks are?</p>

<p>What do you think the main risks are?</p>

<h3>Section C: Considerations if mandatory disability workforce reporting were to be implemented</h3>

<p>This section explores issues requiring careful consideration if disability workforce reporting were to be made mandatory through legislation.</p>

<p>This information will be considered in the broader context of answers to sections A and B, where you were asked to set out the benefits and risks of voluntary and mandatory reporting processes.</p>

<p>Disability workforce reporting is intended to increase transparency and the recruitment, retention and progression of disabled people. Do you agree or disagree that the proportion of employees identifying as disabled is a useful statistic to report on?</p>

<p>Please explain your answer.</p>

<p>What, if any, statistic should be reported alongside or instead of the proportion of employees identifying as disabled? Please explain your answer.</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree that large employers (250 or more employees) should use a standardised approach to collect disability workforce data if reporting became mandatory?</p>

What measures or approaches could make data collection more inclusive of people who do not feel comfortable identifying as or disclosing disability? Please explain your suggestions.</p>

<p>If large employers were required to collect disability workforce information and report it to another organisation, which organisation do you think they should report to?</p>

<p>Should large employers publish organisation-level disability workforce statistics? For example, the proportion of their workforce identifying as disabled.</p>

<p>If published, who do you think should publish this information?</p>
