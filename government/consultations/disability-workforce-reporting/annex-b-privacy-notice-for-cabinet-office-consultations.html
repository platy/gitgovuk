<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and/or 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Your data</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose for which we are processing your personal data is to obtain the opinions of members of the public, parliamentarians and representatives of organisations and companies about departmental policies, proposals, or generally to obtain public opinion data on an issue of public interest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>The data</h3>

<p>We will process the following personal data (where given): name, address, email address, job title, and employer, as well as opinions.</p>

<p>We will also process additional biographical information about respondents or third parties where it is volunteered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Legal basis of processing</h3>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is that it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller. In this case that is consulting on policies or proposals, or obtaining opinion data, in order to develop good effective policies.</p>

<p>Sensitive personal data is personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>The legal basis for processing your sensitive personal data, or data about criminal convictions (where you volunteer it), is that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest for the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department. The function is consulting on policies or proposals, or obtaining opinion data, in order to develop good effective policies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Recipients</h3>

<p>Where individuals submit responses, we may publish their responses, but we will not publicly identify them.  We will endeavour to remove any information that may lead to individuals being identified.</p>

<p>Responses submitted by organisations or representatives of organisations may be published in full.</p>

<p>Where information about responses is not published, it may be shared with officials within other public bodies in order to help develop policy.</p>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT infrastructure it will also be shared with our data processors who provide email, and document management and storage services.</p>

<p>We may share your personal data where required to be law, for example in relation to a request made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Retention</h3>

<p>Published information will generally be retained indefinitely on the basis that the information is of historic value. This would include, for example, personal data about representatives of organisations.</p>

<p>Responses from individuals will be retained in identifiable form for 3 calendar years after the consultation has concluded.</p>

<p>Where personal data have not been obtained from you</p>

<p>Your personal data were obtained by us from a respondent to a consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Your rights</h2>

<p>You have the right to request information about how your personal data are processed, and to request a copy of that personal data.</p>

<p>You have the right to request that any inaccuracies in your personal data are rectified without delay.</p>

<p>You have the right to request that any incomplete personal data are completed, including by means of a supplementary statement.</p>

<p>You have the right to request that your personal data are erased if there is no longer a justification for them to be processed.</p>

<p>You have the right in certain circumstances (for example, where accuracy is contested) to request that the processing of your personal data is restricted.</p>

<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where it is processed for direct marketing purposes.</p>

<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>International transfers</h2>

<p>As your personal data is stored on our IT infrastructure, and shared with our data processors, it may be transferred and stored securely outside the European Union. Where that is the case it will be subject to equivalent legal protection through the use of Model Contract Clauses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Contact details</h2>

The contact details for the data controller are: Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2AS, or 0207 276 1234, or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:publiccorrespondence@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">publiccorrespondence@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
