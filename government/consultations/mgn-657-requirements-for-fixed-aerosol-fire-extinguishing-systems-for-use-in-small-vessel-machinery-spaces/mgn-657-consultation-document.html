<h2>Section 1: Overview of this consultation</h2>

<p><b>Aim</b></p>

<p>1.1 This consultation seeks your views on the draft Marine Guidance Note MGN 657 (M+F) Requirements for Aerosol Fixed Fire Suppression Systems for use in Small Vessel Machinery Spaces. Aerosol fixed firefighting systems have been approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) since 2001. The MCA has previously witnessed and approved the testing of these systems; this MGN seeks to formalise the test methodology and pass approval responsibility to an approved body. Previously, the installation requirements for these systems have been contained within the MCA’s systems approval certificates, and the codes which have approved them for use, this MGN seeks to simplify the requirements by giving details of the installation requirements and vessel applicability.</p>

<p><b>Views sought</b></p>

<p>1.2 Your views are sought in the following areas:</p>

<p>a) any content which you believe to be inaccurate:</p>

<p>b) any typographical errors;</p>

<p>c) any non-statutory advice with which you disagree;</p>

<p>d) any content you believe is unclear;</p>

<p>e) any content you think is inappropriate to include, and should therefore be omitted;</p>

<p>f) any content which has been omitted which you believe should be included;</p>

<p>g) the proportionality of the guidance and any content you believe is overly restrictive or any content that you believe is not going far enough.</p>

<p>h) any thoughts on the expansion of the scope of approval to domestic passenger ships under 24m load line length.</p>

<p>1.3 A full list of consultation questions is contained in Section 5 of this consultation.</p>

<p><b>Deadline for responses</b></p>

<p>1.4 Responses are welcomed from 5 August 2022 until 23:45 on 30 September 2022.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Areas of consideration</h2>
<p>2.1 The MCA has previously approved aerosol fixed fire suppression systems for use in small vessel machinery spaces through approval certificates based on the MCA’s MSF 1814 forms issued to suppliers of aerosol suppression systems. These certificates required the MCA approval of tests to show the safe and effective operation of the systems by live fire testing. This MGN now formalises the process by publishing the test requirements for future approvals and to require the tests are witnessed by an approved body appointed by the MCA.</p>

<p>2.2 The approval certificate provides information on the vessel types that the system is accepted for as well as details of the installation requirements for that system. Requirements that are common to all aerosol fixed firefighting system installations are described in the draft MGN.</p>

<p>2.3 Aerosol fire extinguishing systems involve the release of a chemical agent to extinguish a fire by interruption of the process of the fire. There are two methods considered for applying the aerosol agent to the protected space:</p>

<p>2.4 Condensed aerosols - created in pyrotechnic generators through the combustion of the agent charge.</p>

<p>2.5 Dispersed aerosols - which are not pyrotechnically generated but are stored in compressed gas containers with carrier agents (such as inert or approved halocarbon gasses) with the aerosol released into and distributed throughout the space through valves, pipes &amp; nozzles.</p>

<p>2.6 A UK Approved Body, as appointed under the Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) Regulations 2016, as amended, (“the Regulations”), in this context, is a body which may undertake approval of an aerosol fire suppression system test that complies with the requirements of these test procedures on behalf of the MCA.</p>

<p>2.7 Further details on the UK Approved Bodies requirements can be found in MGN 554 “Marine Equipment - procedure for becoming a UK Approved Body following the UK’s exit from the EU”, as amended, as well as in MIN 590 as amended “United Kingdom conformity assessment procedures for marine equipment following the transition period”.</p>
