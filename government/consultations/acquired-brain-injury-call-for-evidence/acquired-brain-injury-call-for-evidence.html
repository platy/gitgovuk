<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>This call for evidence will inform the development of the government’s acquired brain injury strategy. Rather than a formal consultation on specific proposals, it constitutes a request for ideas on which we can build.</p>

<p>It will run for a period of 12 weeks and is open to everyone aged 16 and over. You can respond as an individual or on behalf of an organisation.</p>

<p>The easiest way to participate in the call for evidence is to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consultations.dhsc.gov.uk/62222c750b1ca136807bca20" rel="external">complete the online survey</a>.</p>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/acquired-brain-injury-call-for-evidence-easy-read">easy read version of the call for evidence</a> is available.</p>

<p>The call for evidence closes at 11.45pm on 6 June 2022.</p>

<h2>Joint foreword from the Minister of State for Care and Mental Health, Gillian Keegan, and the MP for Rhondda, Chris Bryant</h2>

<p>We know that acquired brain injury (<abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr>) can have a devastating impact on an individual, with its impact felt across many aspects of their life. As well as the health impact, it affects family life, it can disrupt close relationships, it can make employment more difficult and it can severely damage an individual’s personal finances. Even minor head injuries can cause short-term impairment and repeated minor injuries can do long-lasting harm. Those living with more severe <abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr> are likely to have complex long-term problems affecting their cognitive and functional abilities, personality, close relationships and ability to return to an independent life.</p>

<p>Our ambition is to prevent brain injuries wherever possible and to achieve a step change in the care and support available to people living with an <abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr>, so that they have the chance to regain the fullest possible quality of life.</p>

<p>We know that many people living with complex long-term health conditions, such as an <abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr>, need support from a range of services. We are committed to supporting all people living with an <abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr> and we recognise that by working collaboratively and having a cross-departmental approach we can strengthen the support that people receive from statutory services.</p>

<p>We are pleased to launch this call for evidence so that we can hear first-hand from the people most affected by <abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr>, including individuals who have a brain injury and those close to them. We are also extending this opportunity to organisations, researchers and other professionals who can provide further valuable insight and who are often important advocates of the needs of this community. Your views and experiences will help us to ensure that we prioritise the actions needed and learn from examples of current and best practice.</p>

<p>We want you to tell us what support or services you would like to see improve, what is good already and what other information and support you would like to see made available. We would also like to hear whether you think that support or services for people living with <abbr title="acquired brain injury">ABI</abbr> could also improve support for people living with other neurological conditions.</p>

<h2>Acquired brain injury strategy</h2>

<p>An acquired brain injury is defined as a non-degenerative injury to the brain occurring since birth.  The term ‘acquired brain injury’ includes both traumatic and non-traumatic brain injuries. </p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by a trauma to the head (head injury). There are many possible causes including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>road traffic accidents</li>
  <li>assaults</li>
  <li>falls and accidents at home or at work</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-traumatic brain injuries can be caused by a wide range of situations, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strokes and other vascular accidents, tumours</li>
  <li>infectious diseases</li>
  <li>hypoxia</li>
  <li>metabolic disorders (for example, liver and kidney diseases or diabetic coma)</li>
  <li>toxic products taken into the body through inhalation or ingestion</li>
</ul>

<p>The government is committed to supporting all people living with an acquired brain injury and those living with other neurological conditions and seeks to prevent acquired brain injuries wherever possible.</p>

<p>On 2 December 2021 the government committed to publishing an acquired brain injury strategy.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care is leading cross-government work to develop the strategy. This call for evidence is asking stakeholders nationwide, including healthcare professionals, people living with an acquired brain injury, their families and carers, to put forward their views on what should be prioritised within the strategy.</p>

<h2>Call for evidence</h2>

<p>We know that many people living with an acquired brain injury need support from a range of services.</p>

<p>For this reason we are asking for your views on what the strategy should look to cover to better support people living with an acquired brain injury, including but not limited to health and social care, access to employment opportunities and benefits, and housing.</p>

<p>We want to hear your views on whether there are other related neurological conditions that should be considered as part of this strategy. There are existing work programmes for dementia, stroke, neurodiversity (including autism) and learning disabilities. To avoid duplication, these conditions will not be within the scope of this strategy. We will, however, continue to work closely with those developing policy in those areas to ensure alignment and identify areas of shared interest.</p>

<p>Given the potential overlap between the different nations and opportunity for areas of shared interest and learning, the call for evidence will be UK-wide and contributions will be considered appropriately.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>The evidence gathered through this exercise will inform the priorities, content and actions to be included in the acquired brain injury strategy. It will ensure that the strategy is evidence-based and reflects what people identify as priorities. We will publish updates on the strategy in due course.</p>

<h2>Data protection</h2>

<p>Over the course of March to June 2022, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) will seek the views of individuals and organisations through a call for evidence, to inform an acquired brain injury strategy. This notice sets out how data collected through this call for evidence will be used and respondents’ rights under Articles 13 and/or 14 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
