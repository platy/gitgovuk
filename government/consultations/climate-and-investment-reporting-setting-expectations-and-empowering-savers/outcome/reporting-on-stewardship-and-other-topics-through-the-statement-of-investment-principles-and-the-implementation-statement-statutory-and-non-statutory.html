<h2>Part 1: Background</h2>

<h2>About this Guidance</h2>

<p>1.	It is important that trustees of all schemes understand and consider financially material Environmental, Social and Governance (<abbr title="Environmental, Social and Governance">ESG</abbr>) factors and stewardship approaches in their investment decision making.</p>

<p>2.	Trustees of occupational pension schemes with 100 or more members, that are required to prepare a Statement of Investment Principles (<abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, are required to publicly state their policy on the exercise of the rights attaching to the investments, and on undertaking engagement activities in respect of the investments via the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, which they are required to publish so that the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> is available free of charge to the public<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Trustees of such schemes are also required to report on how and the extent to which they have followed this policy during the scheme year and to describe the voting behaviour by, or on behalf of trustees, including the most significant votes cast, during the scheme year and state any use of the services of a proxy voter during that year via an annual published Implementation Statement (<abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. Pension schemes subject to these requirements account for more than 99% of savers.</p>

<p>3.	In addition, where such schemes are defined contribution schemes or hybrid schemes providing defined contribution benefits the trustees of such schemes, subject to certain exceptions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, must publish a wider <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> covering how and the extent to which they have followed policies in the whole of their <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.	Subject to certain exceptions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, trustees or managers of occupational pension schemes that are defined contribution schemes or hybrid schemes providing defined contribution benefits are also required to prepare and publish a ‘default <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>5.	This Guidance focuses on the areas where existing policies and reporting appear to be weakest – stewardship and, to a lesser extent, consideration of financially material <abbr title="Environmental, Social and Governance">ESG</abbr> factors and non-financial factors. Stewardship encompasses a range of activities: this Guidance focuses specifically on voting and engagement.</p>

<p>6.	This Guidance refers to the UK Stewardship Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> and indicates areas of potential alignment between the Implementation Statement requirements and the Stewardship Code principles. Trustees can use information in their Stewardship Code reports in the Implementation Statement, providing that information meets the legal requirements for the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Legal status of this Guidance</h2>

<p>7.	This Guidance contains both statutory and non-statutory guidance. Paragraphs that are statutory guidance are prefaced with ‘<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr>’, for ‘Statutory Guidance’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>. Trustees must have regard to the paragraphs of this Guidance that are statutory guidance when complying with the Implementation Statement requirements in the Disclosure Regulations<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup> applicable to them, made under section 113(1) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993.</p>

<p>8.	All paragraphs without the ‘<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr>’ label are non-statutory guidance. The non-statutory guidance is intended to encourage good practice, but trustees are not obliged to take it into account.</p>

<p>9.	The ‘<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr>’ labels are introduced from Part 2 of this Guidance onwards. The contents of Part 1 of this Guidance are statutory guidance when complying with the Implementation Statement requirements in the Disclosure Regulations referred to in paragraph 7. Otherwise, Part 1 is non-statutory guidance.</p>

<p>10.	Signposting of alignment with the UK Stewardship Code is not imposing a requirement for schemes to align their disclosures; it is mentioned to support streamlined reporting.</p>

<p>11.	The following table sets out which sections of the Guidance are statutory and non-statutory.</p>

<h2>‘Must’ vs ‘Should’ vs ‘May’</h2>

<p>12.	In this Guidance, activities will be described as things trustees either ‘should’ do, ‘could’ or ‘may’ choose to do, or ‘must’ do. What this means for the purposes of the Guidance is set out below:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Should</h3>
<p>Where ‘should’ is used in relation to preparation of the IS, it is expected that trustees will follow the approach set out in the Guidance and if they choose to deviate from that approach, they should describe concisely the reasons for doing so in the relevant section of their Implementation Statement.</p>

<h3>Could / May</h3>

<p>Trustees can choose to follow the approach set out in the Guidance, and are encouraged to do so where possible, but if they choose not to they are not expected to explain their reasons in their Implementation Statement or elsewhere. In the Guidance this is also framed as ‘trustees are encouraged to’.</p>

<h3>Must</h3>

<p>This is a requirement imposed by legislation. Failure to meet the requirement may lead to enforcement action by The Pensions Regulator.</p>
</div>

<h2>When this Guidance should be followed</h2>

<p>13.	Trustees of occupational pension schemes that are required to prepare an Implementation Statement are required to have regard to this Guidance, in the circumstances mentioned at paragraph 7 above. However, this Guidance only concerns Implementation Statements that trustees are required to prepare in respect of any scheme year ending on or after 1 October 2022. To the extent this Guidance is non-statutory, trustees are encouraged to consider this Guidance from the date of publication.</p>

<h2>Expiry or review date</h2>

<p>14.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will revisit the extent to which this Guidance is being followed and has helped trustees understand expectations around the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> in the second half of 2023. We will review requirements on disclosures on stewardship activities at the same time.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>15.	This Guidance is relevant to any scheme to which section 35 of the Pensions Act 1995 applies. It is also relevant to schemes that are required to produce a default <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>. Trustees or managers of such schemes may also wish to use this guidance when preparing their default <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>16.	Trustees of some schemes are not required to produce a <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>. These schemes are specified in regulation 6 of the Investment Regulations and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A scheme which has fewer than 100 members (this does not apply to a default <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>); or</li>
  <li>A scheme which is established by or under an enactment (including a local Act) and is guaranteed by a public authority</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compliance with this Guidance</h2>

<p>17.	For occupational pension schemes, The Pensions Regulator (<abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr>) monitors compliance with the legislation and provides guidance about what employers and people running schemes need to do. The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) is responsible for answering questions about the policy intentions behind the legislation. Neither <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> nor <abbr title="The Pensions Regulator">TPR</abbr> can provide a definitive interpretation of the legislation which is a matter for the courts.</p>

<p>18.	Trustees and managers should consider the Regulations referred to in this Guidance to determine whether the requirements apply to them, taking advice where necessary. Where the requirements in the Disclosure Regulations referred to in paragraph 7 relating to the preparation of an <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> apply, trustees should seek to demonstrate they have had regard to the Statutory Guidance contained within this document in complying with the requirements that apply to them, for example by providing reasons for any divergence where the guidance says that trustees ‘should’ do something.</p>

<p>19.	Where trustees or managers do not comply with a relevant legislative requirement of the Investment Regulations or the Disclosure Regulations, including by virtue of a failure to have regard, or to have proper regard, to the Statutory Guidance contained within this document as applicable, The Pensions Regulator may take enforcement action which includes the possibility of a monetary penalty.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Overview</h2>

<h3>The audience for the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>20.	The Pensions Regulator is the primary audience for the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> and trustees are encouraged to write this document in plain English as far as possible, such that a reasonably engaged and informed member could interpret and understand the disclosures.</p>

<p>21.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> The Pensions Regulator is the primary audience for the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> and this document should be written in plain English as far as possible, such that a reasonably engaged and informed member could interpret and understand the disclosures.</p>

<p>22.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> In relation to the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, for trustees who wish to incorporate or duplicate sections from their UK Stewardship Code report, this aligns with the expectation of the Financial Reporting Council that content should be understandable to a wide audience and those without a professional background in investment, stewardship or pensions.</p>

<p>23.	Schemes are encouraged to consider producing member-facing summary versions of the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> (with signposting to the full document) if scheme-specific research has found that members are more likely to engage with a different style of communication, such as a summary version. Schemes could also consider doing so in respect of the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>24.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees may wish to consider, when preparing the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, whether there is any alignment with Principle 6 of the UK Stewardship Code:</p>

<p>Principle 6 asks signatories to take account of client and beneficiary needs and communicate the activities and outcomes of their stewardship and investment to them.</p>

<h2>In scheme members’ best interests</h2>

<p>25.	Trustees are subject to a duty to act in the “best interests” of beneficiaries. The “best interests” maxim serves to keep trustees’ focus firmly on the identity of those for whose benefit their powers are to be exercised and on the fact that, in exercising their powers, the trustees cannot simply exercise powers as they think fit.</p>

<p>26.	The Investment Regulations require trustees, unless exempt, to invest scheme assets in scheme members’ and beneficiaries’ best interests<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup>. Recommendation 15 of the report from the 2020 Asset Management Taskforce<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> recommended that: “UK pension schemes should be required to explain how their stewardship policies and activities are in scheme members’ best interests”.</p>

<p>27.	When considering investment decisions/setting investment strategy, trustees should take into account all factors that are financially material to the performance of an investment. The Pensions Regulator provides guidance to help trustees of <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> schemes identify and assess whether financial factors are material. For example, it says:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“a relatively minor negative financial factor for the default fund or default arrangement may have an impact on a very high proportion of the scheme membership and may be of a material concern to you. On the other hand, a material negative financial factor for an additional self-select fund, in which only a handful of members are invested, will still be a significant issue to members impacted by it, and therefore will also be a material concern to you; and</li>
  <li>you may also need to consider the proportion of a fund that is owned by your scheme, particularly where you have been involved in its specific design. For instance, careful consideration may be needed in relation to the early days where the fund viability might be compromised by any meaningful disinvestment (for example a member transferring out), exposing remaining members to excessive costs or a sub-optimal investment strategy (possibly over-weight in the more illiquid elements of the portfolio); and</li>
  <li>determining what will constitute a financially material consideration will often involve professional judgement; and</li>
  <li>many members will be invested in the same fund for many years if not decades into the future. The ultimate benefits received by a member will largely depend on the performance of the fund. You are required to consider your policy on financially material considerations over the appropriate time horizon for your members.”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>28.	Guidance for trustees on financial factors is also available in relation to <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>29.	Although ‘best interests’ is usually taken to mean the best financial interests of beneficiaries, the Law Commission has said that the law is sufficiently flexible to also allow non-financial concerns to be taken into account in certain circumstances<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>30.	The line between financial and non-financial factors is not always clear. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> encourages trustees, if it is practical to do so, to keep under review non-financial factors that may not immediately present as financially material but have the potential to become so, particularly for schemes with a long-term horizon.</p>

<p>31.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> In reporting on implementation of <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> policies in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, trustees could describe how implementation of policies has driven long-term value for beneficiaries.</p>

<p>32.	Pension scheme trustees are encouraged to explain how their stewardship policies are in scheme members’ and beneficiaries’ best interests in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>33.	Trustees may wish to consider, when preparing the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, whether there is any alignment with Principle 1 of the UK Stewardship Code:</p>

<p>Principle 1 relates to ‘Purpose and Governance’: signatories’ purpose, investment beliefs, strategy, and culture enable stewardship that creates long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.</p>

<p>This Principle includes the expectation that signatories should disclose an assessment of how effective they have been in serving the best interests of clients and beneficiaries.</p>

<h2>Ownership of the documents</h2>

<p>34.	Trustees have responsibility for the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>. Prior to preparing or revising a <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, trustees must obtain and consider the written advice of a person who is reasonably believed by the trustees to be qualified by their ability in and practical experience of financial matters and to have the appropriate knowledge and experience of the management of the investments of such schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>. However, the trustees own the policies set out in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>35.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees also have responsibility for the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>. They are not required to obtain or consider the advice of an adviser in preparing their <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>. Trustees may choose to do so, but it is their choice.</p>

<h2>Streamlining reporting</h2>

<p>36.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> This Guidance aims to provide clarity around schemes using sections of other disclosures, for example disclosures made under the UK Stewardship Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>, for the purposes of the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>.</p>

<p>37.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees can include material from voluntary disclosures, such as Stewardship Code reports, in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> but must adhere to the relevant legal requirements that are applicable (including in accordance with regulations 12 and 29A of the Disclosure Regulations 2013) and, as relevant, have regard to the relevant statutory guidance in doing so. Trustees must not simply cross-refer to existing disclosures, or annex existing disclosures to the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> and cross-refer to the annexed material in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, without also providing a statement in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> which covers the matters prescribed<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>. Where trustees include information from other report(s) in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, they must ensure that the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> can be read and understood as a standalone document.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Stewardship, engagement, and significant votes</h2>

<p>38.	Stewardship is the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>39.	Some of the ways trustees can be responsible stewards in relation to the scheme’s assets are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the appointment of asset managers that invest on their behalf</li>
  <li>in how assets are allocated</li>
  <li>and in monitoring, engaging and where necessary, intervening on matters which may affect the value of investments</li>
</ul>

<p>40.	The issues upon which schemes may act as good stewards encompass – but are not limited to – environmental, social and governance factors. When formulating a stewardship policy and covering that policy in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, trustees may wish to consider how the companies they are invested in approach the following matters<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the effective application of the UK Corporate Governance Code and other governance codes</li>
  <li>directors’ duties, particularly those matters to which directors must have regard under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006</li>
  <li>capital structure, risk, strategy and performance</li>
  <li>diversity, remuneration and workforce interests</li>
  <li>audit quality</li>
  <li>environmental and social issues, including climate change; and</li>
  <li>compliance with covenants and contracts</li>
</ul>

<p>41.	Stewardship covers not only listed equities, but also asset classes such as property, bonds, infrastructure and private equity. It covers assets invested both domestically and globally.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>: trustees taking “ownership” of stewardship</h2>

<p>42.	Trustees must cover in their scheme’s <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> their policies on stewardship, including engagement and voting, as well as their policies in relation to other matters such as financially material <abbr title="Environmental, Social and Governance">ESG</abbr> considerations (covered in Part 4 of this guidance). The <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> must be published.</p>

<p>43.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects trustees to either set their own voting policy or if they have not set their own policy, explain in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> how they will monitor their asset manager’s voting policy. Ultimately, trustees are encouraged to take ownership of the scheme’s stewardship. This means trustees are discouraged from simply reporting that they have delegated stewardship to their asset managers.</p>

<p>44.	Regulation 2(3)(c)(ii) of the Investment Regulations makes clear that the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> must cover the trustees’ policy in relation to undertaking engagement activities in respect of investments including “methods by which, and the circumstances under which, trustees would monitor and engage with relevant persons about relevant matters”. Relevant persons “includes (but is not limited to) an issuer of debt or equity, an investment manager, another stakeholder<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> or another holder of debt or equity” (regulation 2(4)). Trustees cannot, therefore, simply state in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> that they delegate engagement with issuers of debt and equity to their investment managers. They need to also – for example – explain in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> how they will monitor and engage with the investment managers about relevant matters<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>45.	A good strategy could be for trustees to summarise the schemes’ stewardship priorities or themes in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> or provide links to their managers’ policies on those stewardship priorities if available. A good stewardship policy would cover both voting and engagement, but it is acknowledged that stewardship is broader than this.</p>

<p>46.	What constitutes a stewardship priority or theme will vary from scheme to scheme. It will depend on factors like the trustees’ investment beliefs, their assessment of the risks to which the scheme is exposed, members’ and beneficiaries’ best interests, the scheme’s culture, values and business model, trustees’ analysis of their membership demographic and their scheme’s investment horizon, or the distribution of holdings invested across particular sectors or asset classes.</p>

<p>47.	Trustees may wish to consider, when preparing the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, whether there is any alignment with Principle 1 of the UK Stewardship Code:</p>

<p>Principle 1 asks signatories to explain not just their strategy but also their culture, values, and business model.</p>

<p>48.	Stewardship priorities of investors across the market have evolved in recent years and may keep on doing so. Examples of stewardship priorities include climate change, biodiversity, board remuneration and modern slavery. Trustees will be influenced by risk/return outcomes for members and beneficiaries and may focus on different stewardship priorities to the ones listed in this Guidance. Stewardship priorities may need to reflect the extent of exposure and particular challenges of specific sectors and asset classes in which the scheme is invested.</p>

<p>49.	Trustees may wish to consider, when preparing the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, whether there is any alignment with Principle 7 of the UK Stewardship Code:</p>

<p>Principle 7 asks signatories to integrate stewardship and investment, including material environmental, social and governance issues, and climate change, to fulfil their responsibilities.</p>

<p>50.	Once trustees have selected the scheme’s stewardship priorities or themes, it is recommended that where practical to do so, trustees identify whether there are any particular aspects within that priority or theme which are important to the scheme and members and beneficiaries. Trustees are not expected to take non-financial factors into account but may wish to do so.</p>

<p>51.	For example, if the stewardship priority is climate change, which points in relation to climate-related risks and opportunities are the trustees planning to engage and vote on, or select or encourage their asset managers to engage and vote on? The trustees may wish to include these details in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>52.	Trustees may wish to consider, when preparing the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, whether there is any alignment with Principle 9 of the UK Stewardship Code:</p>

<p>Principle 9 asks signatories to explain how they have selected and prioritised engagement (for example, key issues and/or size of holding); and how they have developed well-informed and precise objectives for engagement with examples.</p>

<p>53.	Trustees are encouraged to briefly explain in their <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> why they have selected their stewardship priorities, with reference to why they believe these to be in members’ best interests. This will help members understand what drives the scheme’s stewardship agenda.</p>

<p>54.	Trustees may find it helpful to look at existing resources to help with stewardship, such as the UK Stewardship Code signatory list and reports, the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association (<abbr title="Pension and Lifetime Savings Association">PLSA</abbr>)’s 2021 Stewardship and Voting Guidelines<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> and the Association of Member Nominated Trustees (<abbr title="Association of Member Nominated Trustees">AMNT</abbr>)’s Red Lines Voting Initiative<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>. These could be used, for example, as a benchmark against which to hold asset managers to account.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>: monitoring asset managers and engagement</h2>

<p>55.	Stewardship includes activities like considering the covenant terms that apply to bonds and rights attaching to private equity; but voting in particular is an important stewardship tool, and, under regulation 2(3)(c)(i) of the Investment Regulations, the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> must cover the trustees’ policy in relation to the exercise of voting rights attaching to the investments. Many pension schemes invest in pooled funds. In a pooled fund arrangement, the asset owner (the pension scheme’s trustee body) does not directly own the shares but has an economic interest in the pooled fund.</p>

<p>56.	There are reported problems with splitting the vote in pooled funds, including legal barriers in terms of ownership, IT and operational problems, a weakening of the asset manager’s voice and regulatory barriers<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup>. However, the Taskforce on Pension Scheme Voting Implementation (<abbr title="Taskforce on Pension Scheme Voting Implementation">TPSVI</abbr>) has concluded that none of these problems appear material or insuperable<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>. Trustees have several options to be actively engaged and advocate for the scheme’s policies, even when invested in pooled funds, whether directly or via fund platforms. The following examples may be covered in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>:</p>

<p>57.	Trustees are required to cover in their <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> their policy in relation to undertaking engagement activities in respect of the investments<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup> (including the methods by which, and the circumstances under which, trustees would monitor and engage with “relevant persons” about “relevant matters”). “Relevant persons” includes “investment managers”, also known as asset managers and fiduciary managers. Therefore, trustees must cover in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, what their policy is on engaging with asset managers about “relevant matters”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>. An issuer of debt or equity is also a “relevant person”. Therefore, where schemes (trustees) hold assets directly, they must also cover their policies in relation to engagement with the issuers of those assets about “relevant matters”.</p>

<p>58.	Many pension schemes will not carry out engagement with investee companies directly. In the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>, trustees are encouraged to cover how they ensure that anyone conducting engagement activities on their behalf is aware of their approach to stewardship – including engagement - especially which <abbr title="Environmental, Social and Governance">ESG</abbr> factors and other priorities the trustees believe should be a key focus for their scheme.</p>

<p>59.	Trustees are encouraged to ask their asset managers questions about stewardship as part of the appointment process to check: a) how the manager sees stewardship and engagement, and b) whether the manager’s approach is aligned with the scheme’s approach to stewardship<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>. UK Stewardship Code reports are a good source of information about a manager’s approach to stewardship. The approach any individual manager takes to stewardship and engagement may evolve over time and trustees are encouraged to continue to ask asset managers questions about their approach to engagement, as part of the ongoing monitoring process. It is good practice for trustees to work with advisers to check the effectiveness of the asset manager’s approach to engagement.</p>

<p>60.	Voting activity could be considered alongside trustees’ ongoing engagement and dialogue with asset managers and issuers and the broader stewardship strategy. There are different types of engagement activity: individual engagement is where the investors – including trustees – engage directly with issuers; collaborative engagement involves another level of interaction and collaboration with other investors.</p>

<p>61.	There are also different approaches to engagement – “broadcast” approaches such as letters to multiple investee companies in one fell swoop, using “formal” forums such as company earnings calls and Annual General Meetings, and “bespoke” and tailored two-way engagement. Each of these can be carried out individually or collaboratively<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>62.	A good stewardship policy will include an escalation strategy , which helps trustees – and those acting on their behalf – convey expectations to companies about how they will amplify the exercise of rights including voting, engagement and other stewardship tools and activities where companies do not respond to the schemes’ stewardship efforts to date. It is up to individual schemes to decide what an effective escalation strategy looks like for them.</p>

<p>63.	Trustees may wish to consider alignment with Principle 11 of the UK Stewardship Code when preparing the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>:</p>

<p>Principle 11 asks signatories to, where necessary, escalate stewardship activities to influence issuers.</p>

<p>64.	Voting and engagement can be used in conjunction with each other. Where engagement is well-received by the company, trustees could still consider using voting rights to send a signal to the company about what their expectations are.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>: case study of an effective voting policy</h2>

<p>65.	We note that voting policies will differ and be more appropriate depending on the type of scheme and asset classes involved.</p>

The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> must also include a description of voting behaviour by, or on behalf of trustees (including the most significant votes cast by, or on behalf of, the trustees) during the year and state any use of a proxy voter during that year. There are some exemptions in respect of wholly-insured schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup>.

<h2>The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>: engagement</h2>

<p>68.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Shareholder engagement is a key stewardship tool. Engagements can be concentrated in anticipation of the company’s Annual General Meeting, but they also occur throughout the year. Engagements can take place over an extended period and effective engagement may involve revisiting the issue over several months or years, to work towards key milestones.</p>

<p>69.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> In the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, trustees could consider including the following content on engagement, either in relation to the trustees or any asset manager acting on their behalf:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the engagement objectives that have been set</li>
  <li>examples of engagement<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup> with asset managers and companies or other issuers, including the situation in which engagement took place, the process they followed and the outcome of the engagement</li>

<p>70.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees can include other information in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> about engagement, particularly information that is useful for members.</p>

<p>71.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees can include information in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> from other reports, e.g. their UK Stewardship Code report, where it meets the legal requirements in relation to the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>. There is potential alignment between the following principles of the UK Stewardship Code and the content of the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> relating to engagement:</p>

<p>Principle 8 asks signatories to monitor and hold to account managers and / or service providers.</p>

<p>Principle 9 asks signatories to engage with issuers to maintain or enhance the value of assets.</p>

<p>Principle 10 asks signatories to, where necessary, participate in collaborative engagement to influence issuers.</p>

<p>Principle 11 asks signatories to, where necessary, escalate stewardship activities to influence issuers.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>: voting behaviour</h2>

<p>72.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees must describe in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> the voting behaviour by, or on behalf of, trustees (including the most significant votes cast by trustees or on their behalf) during the year. When describing voting behaviour during the preceding scheme year, in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, trustees should include relevant statistics to help describe voting behaviour and outcomes.</p>

<p>73.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> A better <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> will break voting statistics down into types of issue, including environmental, social and governance issues.</p>

<p>74.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Where trustees have their own policy but voting on an investment is controlled by another person (e.g. asset manager), trustees should explain in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> whether the voting undertaken on their behalf was reflective of the scheme’s voting policy. Where the person exercising voting rights on behalf of the trustees has not voted in a way that reflects the scheme’s voting policy, the trustee should explain in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> why that was the case and include any reasoning.</p>

<p>75.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees may wish to use the <abbr title="Pension and Lifetime Savings Association">PLSA</abbr> Vote Reporting Template  to request voting data from asset managers or any other third-party making decisions on the trustees’ behalf, to help understand how votes were exercised on their behalf, and why.</p>

<p>76.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> If asset managers, or any other third party making decisions on the trustees’ behalf, are unable to give the trustees details of significant votes or other voting information in time for the publication of the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, trustees should include as much detail as possible, including what information is missing and why the information is missing, for example, if it is missing because it was requested from asset managers but not provided.</p>

<p>77.	Trustees are encouraged to indicate in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> whether they have agreed with asset managers a process by which voting data will be provided on a timely basis to enable the preparation of future Implementation Statements.</p>

<p>78.	Where UK-authorised asset managers have not provided voting information to trustees, trustees are encouraged to challenge this with their asset manager. UK-authorised asset managers who manage investments for professional clients are required by the Financial Conduct Authority’s Conduct of Business Sourcebook to disclose clearly on their website, or if they do not have a website in another accessible form, the nature of their commitment to the UK Stewardship Code or, where they do not commit to the Code, to disclose their alternative investment strategy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>79.	Voting is an integral part of the Stewardship Code. Under Principle 6 signatories (including asset managers) should explain in their Stewardship Code report “what they have communicated to clients about their stewardship and investment activities and outcomes to meet their needs, including the type of information provided, methods and frequency of communication to enable them to fulfil their stewardship reporting requirements”. Similarly, the 2021 report from the Taskforce on Pension Scheme Voting Implementation recommended that asset managers and their trade bodies sign up to the principle of answering all reasonable requests on their voting and stewardship activity. Trustees need voting information in order to fulfil their stewardship reporting (and <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> reporting) and will be dependent at times on their asset managers for this information.</p>

<p>80.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> must state any use of a proxy voter during the year<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>81.	Where trustees use the voting policy of the asset manager, they are encouraged to briefly summarise in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> how the manager’s voting policy relates to the scheme’s stewardship priorities.</p>

<p>82.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Where trustees use the voting policy of the asset manager, they should briefly summarise in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> whether the asset manager’s voting behaviour was aligned with the scheme’s stewardship priorities.</p>

<p>83.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Where the trustee has set an expression of wish on voting in relation to any particular investment held, they should indicate in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> whether this has been taken into account by their asset manager, when describing voting behaviour.</p>

<p>84.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees can provide links to their managers’ voting policies if applicable.</p>

<p>85.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> is an opportunity for trustees to set out any steps they took to maximise influence over the way in which votes have been cast. Trustees should explain in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> whether, and how, they made clear to their managers what they considered to be the most significant votes in advance of those votes being taken.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>: most significant votes</h2>

<p>86.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Tens of thousands of votes are cast during every <abbr title="Annual General Meeting">AGM</abbr> season but what constitutes a most significant vote will vary from scheme to scheme, in the same way that stewardship priorities will differ. Asset managers and trustees may also have different views regarding what constitutes a most significant vote for an investment within the scheme’s portfolio.</p>

<p>87.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> It is likely and desirable that most significant votes are aligned with the scheme’s stewardship priorities or themes. A thematic approach towards most significant votes allows trustees to consider the links between the schemes’ stewardship priorities and voting behaviour. For example, if the stewardship priority is climate change, the most significant votes included in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> could be related to that priority.</p>

<p>88.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Where a thematic approach is taken to significant votes, trustees should include in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> how the voting activity links to any stewardship priorities identified. A thematic approach to significant votes may be particularly relevant for schemes with highly diversified portfolios that are exposed to system-wide  or thematic risks such as global pandemics or climate change.</p>

<p>89.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> It is important to recognise that a vote could still be significant, even if it does not relate to a scheme’s stewardship priorities / themes. For example, it may be deemed a most significant vote for a fund to vote against the re-election of a director, or for a remuneration policy or report, even though these have not been issues identified as stewardship priorities or themes for the scheme.</p>

<p>90.	 <abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Examples of significant votes could include:</p>

<p>91.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees should include a brief reason in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> for why a vote has been categorised as most significant. This can help with an understanding of the voting behaviour.</p>

<p>92.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Trustees must report all the most significant votes in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr> should include a narrative explaining why each vote is significant, what the vote was, and why the scheme voted in the way it did. Trustees should include the following information in relation to the most significant votes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The company’s name (unless there are particular sensitivities around disclosing this) and date of the vote(s)</li>
  <li>Why the trustee considers the vote to be most significant and if the vote relates to a stewardship priority / theme, which one?</li>
  <li>Approximate size of the scheme’s/ mandate’s holding as at the date of the vote (this could be as a percentage of the portfolio)</li>
  <li>A summary of the resolution</li>
  <li>How the trustee, asset manager, or service provider voted</li>
  <li>If the vote was against management, whether the intention was communicated to the company ahead of the vote</li>
  <li>An explanation of the rationale for the voting decision, particularly where: there was a vote against the board; there were votes against shareholder resolutions; a vote was withheld; or the vote was not in line with voting policy</li>
  <li>The outcome of the vote</li>
  <li>Next steps, including whether the trustee / asset manager / service provider intends to escalate stewardship efforts</li>
</ul>

<p>93.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> Where the asset manager votes on the scheme’s behalf, the trustee should decide which of those votes are most significant, and must include those in the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>.</p>

<p>94.	<abbr title="Statutory Guidance">SG</abbr> In the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, trustees can use information included in other reports, for example UK Stewardship Code reports, where that information meets the legal requirements in relation to the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>. For example, trustees may wish to consider, when preparing the <abbr title="Implementation Statement">IS</abbr>, whether there is any alignment with Principle 12 of the UK Stewardship Code. This asks signatories to actively exercise their rights and responsibilities:</p>

<p>For listed equity assets, signatories should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disclose the proportion of shares that were voted in the past year and why</li>
  <li>provide a link to their voting records, including votes withheld if applicable</li>
  <li>explain their rationale for some or all voting decisions, particularly where:
    <ul>
      <li>there was a vote against the board</li>
      <li>there were votes against shareholder resolutions</li>
      <li>a vote was withheld</li>
      <li>the vote was not in line with voting policy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>explain the extent to which voting decisions were executed by another entity, and how they have monitored any voting on their behalf; and</li>
  <li>explain how they have monitored what shares and voting rights they have</li>
</ul>

<p>For fixed income assets, signatories should explain their approach to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seeking amendments to terms and conditions in indentures or contracts</li>
  <li>seeking access to information provided in trust deeds</li>
  <li>impairment rights; and</li>
  <li>reviewing prospectus and transaction documents</li>

<p>111.	Trustees are encouraged to explain in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> how they ensure that their policies in relation to financially material considerations are aligned with the approaches of their asset managers.

<h3>The <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>: non-financial matters – content in the <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>116. Under regulation 2(3)(b)(vii) of the Investment Regulations a <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> must cover the trustees’ policy in relation to the extent (if at all) to which non-financial matters are taken into account in the selection, retention and realisation of investments. Under regulation 2A(1)(b) of the Investment Regulations, a default <abbr title="Statement of Investment Principles">SIP</abbr> must cover the trustees’ or managers’ policy in relation to these matters in respect of the default arrangement. Non-financial matters are defined in regulation 2(4) of the Investment Regulations as “the views of the members and beneficiaries including (but not limited to) their ethical views and their views in relation to social and environmental impact and present and future quality of life of the members and beneficiaries of the trust scheme”.</p>

This could include views about its investments and its stewardship.</p>

<p>118. Trustees of other schemes are encouraged to have a mechanism by which members may express views about the consideration of non-financial matters in the selection, retention and realisation of investments, including about stewardship. This is particularly the case where savers directly bear the financial risk, as in <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> schemes, <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> sections of dual-section hybrid schemes, some mixed benefit hybrid schemes and cost sharing schemes. In relation to investments, trustees are encouraged to make it possible for savers to express views on both self-select options and any default arrangements.</p>

<p>i.	how the arrangement with the asset manager incentivises the asset manager to align its investment strategy and decisions with trustees’ policies<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup>;</p>

<p>ii.	how that arrangement incentivises the asset manager to make decisions based on assessments about medium to long-term financial and non-financial performance of an issuer of debt or equity and to engage with issuers of debt or equity in order to improve their performance in the medium to long-term;</p>

<p>iii.	how the method (and time horizon) of the evaluation of the asset manager’s performance and the remuneration for asset management services are in line with the trustees’ policies<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup>;</p>

<p>iv.	how the trustees monitor portfolio turnover costs incurred by the asset manager, and how they define and monitor targeted portfolio turnover or turnover range (where standardised cost reporting templates are used with asset managers, such as the <abbr title="Cost Transparency Initiative">CTI</abbr> template<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup> we encourage trustees to make reference to this); and</p>
