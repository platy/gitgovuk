<h2>Privacy notice for digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk</h2>

<h3>Who is collecting my data?</h3>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) helps to drive growth, enrich lives and promote Britain abroad.</p>

<p>We protect and promote our cultural and artistic heritage and help businesses and communities to grow by investing in innovation and highlighting Britain as a fantastic place to visit. We help to give the UK a unique advantage on the global stage, striving for economic success.</p>

<h3>Purpose of this Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>This notice is provided within the context of the changes required by the Article 13 &amp; 14 of UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). This notice sets out how we will use your personal data as part of our legal obligations with regard to Data Protection.</p>

<p>DCMS’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> (opens in a new tab) explains how we deal with your information. It also explains how you can ask to view, change or remove your information from our records.</p>

<h3>What is personal data?</h3>

<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural living person, otherwise known as a ‘data subject’. A data subject is someone who can be recognised, directly or indirectly, by information such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or data relating to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. These types of identifying information are known as ‘personal data’. Data protection law applies to the processing of personal data, including its collection, use and storage.</p>

<h3>What personal data do we collect?</h3>

<p>Most of the personal information we collect and process is provided to us directly by you. This includes:</p>

<p>Your email address you provide to us when getting in contact with <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk">digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Any other information you may provide in your email</p>

<h3>How will we use your data?</h3>

<p>The personal data we process are the details of individuals who send an email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk">digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk</a>. This is processed by DCMS for the purposes of the consultation, so we can respond to your queries and views. It may also include using your personal data to invite you to events relating to the consultation. Finally, there may be a need to follow up in the aftermath of the consultation on the same topic or closely related topics.</p>

<h3>What is the legal basis for processing my data?</h3>

<p>The Data Protection Legislation states that, as government departments, the departments may process personal data as necessary for the effective performance of a task carried out in the public interest (i.e. a consultation).
What will happen if I do not provide this data?</p>

<p>You will not be able to get in contact with <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk">digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk</a> without at least providing your email address.</p>

<h3>How long will my data be held for?</h3>

<p>Your personal data will be held for two years after the survey is closed. This is so that the department is able to contact you regarding your email addressed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk">digital-identity-consultation@dcms.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Will my data be used for automated decision making or profiling?</h3>

<p>We will not normally use your data for any automated decision making. If we need to do so, we will let you know. 
Will my data be transferred outside the UK and if it is how will it be protected?</p>

<p>We will not send your data overseas. If we need to do so, we will let you know.</p>

<h3>What are your data protection rights?</h3>

<p>You have rights over your personal data under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018). The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is the supervisory authority for data protection legislation, and maintains a full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/accountability-framework/individuals-rights/" rel="external">explanation of these rights on their website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DCMS will ensure that we uphold your rights when processing your personal data.</strong></p>
