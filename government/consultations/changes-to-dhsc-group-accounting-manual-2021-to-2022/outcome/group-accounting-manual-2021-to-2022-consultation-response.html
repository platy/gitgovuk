<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>1.1  All bodies within the Department of Health and Social Care accounting boundary (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies) must publish annual reports and accounts.&nbsp;Clear and transparent reporting helps the entity, as well as the users of the entity’s annual report and accounts, understand and scrutinise the year’s operations and outcomes.</p>

<p>1.2  <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> (and Monitor as the regulator for NHS foundation trusts, operating under the banner of NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS Improvement">NHSI</abbr>)) has powers to direct the form in which the annual report and accounts should be prepared, the information that should be included, and the methods and principles that should be followed in their preparation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.3  In determining the form and content of the accounts we must, by statute, aim to ensure the accounts present a true and fair view.</p>

<p>1.4 In order to achieve this, the department issues a group-wide annual report and accounting manual every year, the group accounting manual (<abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>), containing the requirements <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies need to follow when preparing their annual reports and accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.5 The NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual (<abbr title="foundation trust annual reporting manual">FT ARM</abbr>) establishes the annual reporting requirements for NHS foundation trusts. The <abbr title="foundation trust annual reporting manual">FT ARM</abbr> contains the formal accounts’ direction, but foundation trusts will follow the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> for accounts requirements.</p>

<p>1,6 The <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> requires <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies to follow the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (<abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr>), as adopted by the United Kingdom, interpreted and adapted by the HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual (<abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>).</p>

<p>1.7 Therefore, the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> only includes detailed accounting guidance where <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>required to depart from <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> or the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>required to make specific disclosures in addition to <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> and the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>faced with particular circumstances that <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> or the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> do not address</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.8 Updates to the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> follow the same principle and, on that basis, are required where <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> or the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> have changed, or when <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies are required to make specific extra disclosures.</p>

<p>1.9 Some content for 2021 to 2022 is not yet available, such as Treasury discount rates.&nbsp;The <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> indicates where this is the case, and the manual will be revised later in the year once this content is known.&nbsp;The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-group-accounting-manual-2021-to-2022">additional guidance document published alongside the updated 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr></a> will signpost the changes made within the manual.</p>

<h2>Background to this consultation</h2>

<p>2.1 This consultation related to the draft <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> for 2021 to 2022.&nbsp;The consultation period ran from 1 February 2021 until 28 February 2021.&nbsp;Proceeding the consultation period, the revised <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> has been subject to further assessment by HM Treasury’s Financial Reporting Advisory Board (<abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr>) to clear the final draft.</p>

<p>2.2 Detailed feedback has been received from the user and audit community as well as technical experts, which has helped inform and enhance the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>.&nbsp;The proceeding sections of this document summarise the technical question posed, responses received and the department’s action.</p>

<p>2.3 Following this consultation and after consideration by <abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-group-accounting-manual-2021-to-2022">2021 to 2022 group accounting manual</a> was published on 12 May 2021.</p>

<h2>Details of consultation questions and responses</h2>

<h3>Adoption of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 leases</h3>

<p>3.1 The objective of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 is to report information that faithfully represents lease transactions, and provides a better basis for users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.</p>

<p>3.2 Specific consultation regarding the adoption of the standard by HM Treasury took place in previous financial years. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group-wide consultations coincided with the <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 exposure drafts published by HM Treasury.</p>

<p>3.3 With the adoption of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 on 1 April 2022 for the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> consulted upon continues to employ International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17 in accounting for leases.</p>

<p>3.4 Consequently, alongside the draft 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, the department consulted on a revised <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 supplement, which has been published to provide early indication of the level of guidance to be offered in the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, as well as the specific accounting policies to be employed by group bodies.</p>

<p>3.5 The supplement has been consulted on over a number of years now. It continues to be refined in light of evolving HM Treasury guidance on the application of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16, and supplemented in various areas accordingly. For the iteration consulted on as part of the 2021 to 2022 process, this included refinements to chapters 2, 4 and 5.</p>

<h3>Consultation questions on the <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> guidance</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments regarding the HM Treasury interpretations and adaptations for IFRS 16?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.6 Feedback received reflected the fact that the respondents had already had an opportunity to provide their feedback and comments in earlier consultations held on <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> 2019 to 2020 and <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 supplement. A request was made for the supplement to be updated and published ahead of the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, which was done as part of a refresh of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 preparedness plans in autumn to winter 2021. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decisions</h4>

<p>3.7 The department will continue to liaise with HM Treasury on finalising the accounting and budgeting approach to <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16. This will enable robust guidance to be developed in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> around all of the proposed public sector interpretations and adaptations of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16, and help to assist <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies applying <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 and, where possible, alleviate the reporting complexities and pressures.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments regarding the transition to an IFRS 16 measurement basis for the valuation and disclosure of PFI liabilities?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.8 Comments from the respondents focused on the guidance to be provided, which will aid preparers in working through the implications of this change. The timing and extent of guidance were key concerns cited by respondents.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decisions</h4>

<p>3.9 The department is acutely aware of the potential impact the transition to an <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 measurement basis will have on entities that have been reliant on a longstanding private finance initiative (<abbr title="private finance initiative">PFI</abbr>) model. The department has emphasised the importance of guidance in this area during <abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr> meetings and has discussed the approach to guidance with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (<abbr title="Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy">CIPFA</abbr>), the Local Authority (Scotland) Accounts Advisory Committee (<abbr title="Local Authority (Scotland) Accounts Advisory Committee">LASAAC</abbr>) and HM Treasury.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments regarding the guidance offered for entities acting as a lessee?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.10 The responses were supportive of the guidance provided and identified potential areas for further refinement in explaining how transitioned leases can incur capital departmental expenditure limit (<abbr title="Departmental Expenditure Limit">DEL</abbr>) impacts and in reducing cross-references to the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decision</h4>

<p>3.11 <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is grateful for respondents continuing to identify how the guidance offered by the department can continue to be refined. Refinements of the guidance were reflected in subsequent updates of the <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 supplement published.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you agree or disagree with the accounting policy approach mandated in the group accounting manual of not applying IFRS 16 to other intangible assets not covered by paragraph 3 (e) of the standard?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.12 The majority of the responses support the decision to not apply <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 to other intangible assets.</p>

<p>3.13 One respondent expressed a concern that there is a widening mismatch between budgetary impact of tangible assets and intangible assets, which are increasingly more revenue in nature, and observed that, by mandating that <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 cannot be applied to intangible assets, there is less scope for capitalising spend on IT or digital contracts.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decision</h4>

<p>3.14 Given the broad support noted by the respondents, we are content that <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 should not apply <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 to other intangible assets not covered by paragraph 3 (e) of the standard. The evolving nature of the budgeting currencies required for the procurement of intangible goods and services is a matter that is routinely discussed with delivery partners such as NHSX.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments regarding the guidance offered in the group accounting manual for entities acting as a lessor or intermediary lessor under IFRS 16?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.15 Respondents provided a number of suggested refinements to the guidance, which included providing additions to the illustrative examples provided in the guidance and offering further detail around lease modification.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decision</h4>

<p>3.16 While keen to not overcomplicate the illustrative examples provided, the department is grateful for the insights of the respondents and has made minor adjustments to the examples referenced by respondents. Further detail regarding the instances in which modification take place has been added to the guidance.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments regarding the guidance offered in the group accounting manual concerning disclosure requirements under IFRS 16?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.17 No substantive responses were received.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decision</h4>

<p>3.18 Disclosure in accounts is a matter that has been addressed in previous consultations so the lack of further responses on this matter is not surprising.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any further comments regarding IFRS 16 application described in the group accounting manual?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.19 Comments from respondents included suggested enhancements to guidance around sale and leaseback, the applicability and potential inconsistency around VAT recoverability to the £5,000 low value threshold, and various areas in which grammar and flow of the guidance could be refined. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decision</h4>

<p>3.20 The department is grateful for respondents identifying further improvements to the guidance provided. &nbsp;</p>

<p>3.21 The department will continue to consider whether the materiality and complexity of sale and leaseback under <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 requires further guidance, and has consulted on this point specifically in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-dhsc-group-accounting-manual-2022-to-2023">2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> consultation</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>3.22 Regarding the inconsistency of the threshold between leased and owned assets, the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr> determination to apply International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (<abbr title="International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee">IFRIC</abbr>) interpretation 21 to leased assets that incur irrecoverable VAT charges already creates an inconsistency in the wider valuation approach between leased and owned assets.&nbsp;The department included detail in the example accounting policy to explain to the user the inconsistency in approach to VAT between leased and owned assets for this reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.23 The department’s preference would be consistency in approach to valuation of leased and owned assets to allow greater comparability, but as this matter has been considered in detail by <abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr>, the department considers it appropriate to maintain the inconsistency in approach to the low value threshold as part of the wider inconsistency between leased and owned assets.</p>

<p>3.24 The guidance published post-consultation contains various corrections for grammatical errors identified.</p>

<h3>Changes to fair pay disclosures stemming from the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>
</h3>

<p>3.25 The 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> revises the disclosure requirements in relation to the fair pay disclosures to more closely follow the requirements prescribed in regulation by requiring entities to disclose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>percentage changes of the highest paid director components of the single total figure table and the average percentage change for the corresponding components of the single total figure table taking the employees of the entity as a whole</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the 25th and 75th percentile pay ratio in addition to the median pay ratio</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.26 The guidance in the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> identifies that, where these disclosure requirements are new for 2021 to 2022, the provision of a prior year comparative is best practice but not mandated. This approach is replicated in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> guidance.</p>

<h3>Consultation questions on the changes to fair pay disclosures stemming from the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>
</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments on the revised disclosure requirements relating to fair pay that are described in the FReM and replicated in chapter 3 of the group accounting manual?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.27 Responses received identified that the HM Treasury requirements could be articulated and visualised more clearly in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, as well as make reference to how subsidiaries are to be treated and provide a clear expectation as to whether annualised figures are to be used for in-year changes.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decisions</h4>

<p>3.28 The department has made revisions to the guidance around the revised fair pay disclosure requirements in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> that was published, and has fed back to HM Treasury on the comments received in this area. This will help inform HM Treasury’s update to the previously relevant ‘Hutton Guidance’, which provided additional detail in regards to compilation of the fair pay disclosures.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments on the guidance provided in relation to the revised disclosure requirements in chapter 3 of the group accounting manual?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.29 Responses received recommended further guidance around calculating elements of the new disclosure requirements as well as suggestions for refinement of the guidance.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decisions</h4>

<p>3.30 The department fed back to HM Treasury on the comments received in this area, to help inform HM Treasury’s update to the previously relevant ‘Hutton Guidance’, which provided additional detail in regards to compilation of the fair pay disclosures. This informed the finalisation of the guidance in the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> in this area.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments in relation to chapter 3 of the group accounting manual?</p>
</div>

<h4>Summary of responses</h4>

<p>3.31 Responses received included recommendations to provide further clarity over the scope of off-payroll reporting recently revised by HM Treasury and Cabinet Office, additional refinement to remuneration guidance in relation to the pensions tables, as well as other minor refinements to improve the usability of the guidance in chapter 3.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decisions</h4>

<p>3.32 The department made a number of minor refinements to the guidance provided in chapter 3 of the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> prior to its publication in May. The department is also aware of further issues discussed in relation to the remuneration reports during the year-end audit process and has provided revision to the guidance in light of this as part of the in-year update process.</p>

<h3>Other changes to the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>
</h3>

<p>3.33 Various other changes had been made to the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> in light of updated guidance around off-payroll disclosures, standard-setters applicable to UK and various other minor adjustments.</p>

<h3>Consultation questions relating to other changes identified in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>

<p>3.34 No comments were made.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any other general comments on the draft group accounting manual?</p>

<p>3.35 Responses received focused on additional guidance that could be provided around going concern, reducing cross referencing, the move from annual audit letters to annual auditor reports and further enhancements that could be made in regards to the guidance around the remuneration report.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s decisions</h4>

<p>3.36 The department made a number of minor refinements to the guidance provided in chapter 3 of the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> prior to its publication in May. As confirmed in paragraph 3.32, further revisions to the remuneration guidance are being considered.</p>

<p>3.37 Prior to the finalisation of the 2020 to 2021 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS Improvement">NHSI</abbr> worked closely with the National Audit Office (NAO) and local audit representatives to revise guidance around going concern, which was reflected in the 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>. Likewise, reflecting the changes in the latest code of practice published in moving to annual auditor reports was applied to both 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 GAMs.</p>

<p>3.38 The department seeks to continuously improve the usability of the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> and is grateful respondents continue to identify ways in which the guidance can be made more complete and user-friendly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion to the consultation</h2>

<p>4.1 We are grateful for all the responses we received to our consultation.&nbsp;As a result of these, we made a number of changes to the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> before publication and finalisation of the year end 2020 to 2021 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.2 In considering the comments received, we have needed to ensure that the guidance given in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> is clear and sufficient, without becoming overly detailed or prescriptive. In some cases, therefore, we have noted comments made, but have concluded that the guidance should remain as drafted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.3 We would like to thank all respondents for their direct input into delivering a product <abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr> was content to approve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.4 There is always scope to deliver further improvements to the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>, and we have taken away a number of issues from this consultation for consideration in drafting the 2022 to 2023 manual.</p>
