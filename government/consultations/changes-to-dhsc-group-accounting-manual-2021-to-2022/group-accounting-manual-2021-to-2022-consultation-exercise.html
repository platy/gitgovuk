<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>All bodies within the Department of Health and Social Care accounting boundary (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies) must publish annual reports and accounts. Clear and transparent reporting helps the entity, as well as the users of the entity's annual report and accounts, understand and scrutinise the year's operations and outcomes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> (and Monitor as the regulator for NHS foundation trusts, operating under the banner of NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE and NHSI)) has powers to direct the form in which the annual report and accounts should be prepared, the information that should be included, and the methods and principles that should be followed in their preparation.</p>

<p>In determining the form and content of the accounts we must, by statute, aim to ensure the accounts present a true and fair view.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, the department issues a group wide annual report and accounting manual every year, the group accounting manual (<abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>), containing the requirements <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies need to follow when preparing their annual reports and accounts.</p>

<p>The NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual (<abbr title="NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual">FT ARM</abbr>) establishes the annual reporting requirements for NHS foundation trusts. The <abbr title="NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual">FT ARM</abbr> contains the formal accounts direction but foundation trusts will follow the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> for accounts requirements.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> requires <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies to follow the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (<abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr>), as adopted by the United Kingdom, interpreted and adapted by the HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual (<abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>).</p>

<p>Therefore, the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> only includes detailed accounting guidance where <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>required to depart from <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> or the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>
</li>
  <li>required to make specific disclosures in addition to <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> and the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>, or</li>
  <li>faced with particular circumstances that <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> or the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> do not address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Updates to the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> follow the same principle and, on that basis, are required where <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> or the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> have changed, or when <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies are required to make specific extra disclosures.</p>

<p>Some content for 2021 to 2022 is not yet available, such as HM Treasury discount rates. The draft <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> indicates where this is the case, and the manual will be revised later in the year once this content is known. An additional guidance document published alongside subsequent updates of the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> will signpost the changes made within the manual.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2021 to </span> 2022 consultation</h2>

<p>This consultation relates to the draft <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> for 2021 to 2022. The documents being consulted upon can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/department-of-health-group-accounting-guidance"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group accounting manual collection</a> page on gov.uk.</p>

<p>The consultation period will run from 1 February 2021 until 28 February 2021.</p>

<p>The 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> will be published in April 2021, once we have considered consultation responses and further refined the guidance offered in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>.</p>

<p>Post consultation changes will be made in collaboration with the relevant sector finance leads. The publication of the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> is subject to approval by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board (<abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Principal changes proposed in the draft <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are no significant changes to the accounting requirements for the 2021 to 2022 financial year but there are some changes to reporting requirement for the 2021 to 2022 financial year.</p>

<p>Changes to the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> are therefore focussed on providing clarity regarding the changing reporting requirements and some cosmetic enhancements to enhance understandability.</p>

<p>This document summarises the principal changes introduced in the draft <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>.</p>

<h2>How to respond</h2>

<p>Please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consultations.dhsc.gov.uk/600afd9ee2dfd31dae3392f0" rel="external">submit your responses by 28 February 2021 via the online consultation</a>.</p>

<h2>Adoption of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 leases</h2>

<p><abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16, leases, is set to supersede IAS 17, leases, SIC 15, Operating Leases â Incentives, SIC 27, Evaluation the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease, and IFRIC 4, determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, across the public sector from 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The objective of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 is to report information that faithfully represents lease transactions and provides a better basis for users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.</p>

<p>Specific consultation regarding the adoption of the Standard by HM Treasury took place in previous financial years. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group wide consultations have taken place to coincide with the publication of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 Exposure Drafts by HM Treasury and as part of the recent <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> consultations.</p>

<p>Given the material nature of leasing arrangements entered in to across the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Group, across the public sector more widely and adoption by entities who follow UK adopted <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 application guidance has already been published and regularly updated by HM Treasury, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS England and NHS Improvement.</p>

<p>As part of recent <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> consultations <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> consulted on an <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 supplement. This supplement served to give group bodies an early indication of the level of guidance intended to be offered on application of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Group, as well as indication of specific accounting policies to be employed by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Group. The latest version of the supplement was published as part of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dhsc-ifrs-16-implementation-guidance"><abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 implementation guidance</a> publication in December 2019.</p>

<p>The supplement has been revised to reflect the most recent updates to HM Treasury guidance and enhance the existing guidance contained within the document. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refinement of summary budgeting impact guidance to go into chapter 2 of the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>
</li>
  <li>update regarding the approach to accounting for PFI arrangements on the implementation of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 in 2022-23</li>
  <li>enhancement of the guidance to be provided in chapter 4 Annex 11 of the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> and update to the guidance referencing the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr> determination concerning approach to irrecoverable VAT</li>
  <li>update to guidance relating to chapter 5 and chapter 5 annex 1 to reflect revised guidance relevant to chapter 4 of the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This consultation represents a further opportunity to comment on the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Group approach to <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16, prior to formal publication of the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> in April 2022. Various consultation questions enable entities to consider the differing aspects of <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 guidance in turn.</p>

<h3>Consultation questions on the <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr> 16 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> guidance</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any further comments regarding the HM Treasury interpretations and adaptations for IFRS 16?</p>

<h2>Changes to fair pay disclosures stemming from the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> makes revision to the guidance surrounding the single total figure table and revises the disclosure requirements in relation to the fair pay disclosure.</p>

<p>The remuneration reporting guidance in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> underwent updates in 2017 to 18 and 2018 to 2019. The <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> is now providing some of the enhanced guidance that is already detailed in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> concerning the single total figure table, such as disclosure relating to the recovery or withholding of sums, disclosure requirements regarding taxable benefits and requirements when additional columns are set out.</p>

<p><abbr title="Financial Reporting Advisory Board">FRAB</abbr> paper 142 (08) confirms that the changes made are to improve guidance provided in the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> than introduce new reporting requirements around the single total figure table. As such further revisions to this area of the remuneration reporting guidance in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> is not being proposed.</p>

<p>However revision is being made in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> to replicate the revised disclosure requirements relating to Fair Pay Disclosures in the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>.</p>

<p>Disclosures in relation to fair pay in the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> more closely follow the requirements prescribed in regulation by requiring entities to disclose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>percentage changes of the highest paid director components of the single total figure table and the percentage change for the corresponding components of the single total figure table taking the employees of the entity as a whole</li>
  <li>as well as the median pay, the 25th and 75th percentile pay ratio must also be disclosed</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance in the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr> identifies that where these disclosure requirements are new for 2021 to 2022 the provision of a prior year comparative is best practice but not mandated. This approach is replicated in the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> guidance.</p>

<h3>Consultation questions on the updates to elements of the remuneration reporting therefore stem from the revisions made to the 2021 to 2022 disclosure requirements in the <abbr title="HM Treasury Financial Reporting Manual">FReM</abbr>
</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do you have any comments on the revised disclosure requirements relating to fair pay that are described in the FReM and replicated in chapter 3 of the group accounting manual?</p>

<p>Do you have any comments on the guidance provided in relation to the revised fair pay disclosure requirements in chapter 3 of the group accounting manual?</p>

<p>Do you have any further comments in relation to chapter 3 of the group accounting manual?</p>
</div>

<h2>Other changes to the 2021 to 2022 <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Changes have been made to the draft <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> that users should note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an additional paragraph giving clearer guidance on performance reporting and incorporating performance against national quality indicators has been added in chapter 3 of the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> refers to UK than EU adopted <abbr title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="group accounting manual">GAM</abbr> has been subject to cosmetic updates which seeks to improve readability of the document by breaking down longer paragraphs to enhance the impact of key messages</li>
