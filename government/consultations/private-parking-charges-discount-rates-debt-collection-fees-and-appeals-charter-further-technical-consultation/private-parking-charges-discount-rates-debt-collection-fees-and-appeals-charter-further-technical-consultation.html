<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Background</h2>

<p>1.	In response to widespread concerns about the poor practice and behaviour of some parking operators, the government supported the Parking (Code of Practice) Act 2019. This was introduced by Sir Greg Knight MP and will lead to the creation of an independent Code of Practice for private parking companies.</p>

<p>2.	The government is developing the Code of Practice through the British Standards Institution (<abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr>) in close consultation with key stakeholders, including landowners, consumer and motoring organisations, and the private parking industry. Last year, the <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> publicly consulted on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/projects/2020-00193" rel="external">draft Code</a>. It is now revising the Code in light of the responses, before its final publication.</p>

<p>3.	The Code, however, is only one part of a wider framework. Last year, in parallel to the <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> consultation on the Code, <abbr title="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr> consulted on the Parking Code Enforcement Framework. On 20 March 2021 the government  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/parking-code-enforcement-framework">published its response</a>.</p>

<p>4.	The Code Enforcement Framework consultation response announced the Government’s intention to develop a series of fairer parking measures which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the creation of a single independent appeals service to handle appeals against private parking charges</li>
  <li>strengthening of the current system of self-regulation by producing a Certification Scheme, independently assessed by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, to which parking trade associations must adhere if their members wish to request access to DVLA data</li>
  <li>the establishment of a Scrutiny and Oversight Board to oversee the operation of the new system and monitor its effectiveness, including through the gathering and use of relevant data on the private parking sector;</li>
  <li>the raising of a levy to contribute towards the costs of the new Code, its enforcement and the appeals service</li>
  <li>publication of an Appeals Charter to protect motorists from charges that are unfair or issued in error</li>
  <li>proposals to bring private parking charges into closer alignment with Local Authority Penalty Charge Notices, including its system of 50% discounts for early payment</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	This further technical consultation seeks views on proposals in the Code Enforcement Framework consultation response for a new system for private parking charges and the Appeals Charter in particular. It also seeks responses on new proposals to protect motorists from unfair debt collection practices in the private parking sector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Level of parking charges (including discount for early payment)</h2>

<p>6.	The primary purpose of parking charges is to encourage compliance with parking restrictions.</p>

<p>7.	Currently, the Accredited Trade Associations (<abbr title="Accredited Trade Associations">ATAs</abbr>) voluntary cap private parking charges at £100, with higher amounts requiring special approval. Regardless of the location or value of the site or the seriousness of the breach of terms and conditions, any breach in a given car park will attract a charge up to the same £100 cap.</p>

<p>8.	The system is different for local authority Penalty Charge Notices (<abbr title="Penalty Charge Notices">PCNs</abbr>). Councils apply a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.patrol-uk.info/contravention-codes/" rel="external">lower or higher level of penalty</a>, depending on the seriousness of the contravention. The levels are £70/60 for higher penalties and £50/40 for lower penalties outside of London and £130/120 and £80/70 in London.</p>

<p>9.	To provide greater consistency for motorists and ensure proportionality, many motorist and consumer groups called for private parking to be aligned with the local authority system.</p>

<p>10.	The private parking industry has, however, pointed to differences in the enforceability of private parking charges and local authority <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notices">PCNs</abbr>, perceived inadequacies with the level of deterrents in the local authority system and that civil parking enforcement is concerned with parking spaces, whereas private parking’s contractual system applies to private land, which includes both parking spaces and land on which parking is not invited.</p>

<p>11.	The government agrees with the principle of capping parking charges, currently done on a voluntary basis by the private parking industry. Limiting the maximum penalty amount protects the consumer from unreasonable or excessive parking charges.</p>

<p>12.	In the Parking Code Enforcement Framework consultation last year, we sought views on whether private parking charges should be aligned with local authority Penalty Charge Notices or whether we should introduce a new separate three-tiered system. The latter proposed new caps of £120, £100 and £80, with a 40% discount for early payment.</p>

<p>13.	In designing a new system for the caps, we have considered the responses to the Code Enforcement Framework consultation and have been guided by the following policy objectives:</p>

<p>i.	To ensure that charges are proportionate to the level of harm caused and are consistent with other parking penalties.</p>

<p>ii.	To ensure that the levels of private parking charges are sufficient to prevent non-compliance with parking restrictions on private land.</p>

<p>iii.	To ensure effective delivery of the new parking charges in practice.</p>

<p>14.	Most respondents to the Code Enforcement Framework consultation (81%) supported the three-tiered system, with almost half highlighting the need for the parking charge to be proportionate to the nature of the breach.</p>

<p>15.	The government agrees with the principle of proportionality. However, we think that the introduction of a separate three-tiered system for private parking, distinct to the well-understood tiered system in local authorities, risks creating confusion for motorists.</p>

<p>16.	At the same time, we have considered the arguments against straightforwardly applying the local authority system to private land. These arguments include the perceived lack of flexibility of a two-tier system and the unsuitability of some of the local authority <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr> levels outside of London when transposed to private land.</p>

<p>17.	In particular, we accept the argument that civil parking enforcement concerns parking spaces where parking is invited, whereas parking on private land encompasses private land in general. As this includes both parking spaces intended for parking but also land where parking is not welcomed, any new system must balance the needs of motorists with protecting the owners of private land.</p>

<p>18.	As a result, we have designed a new, hybrid model that takes elements from both local authority and three-tiered systems.</p>

<p>19.	In line with our objective of greater consistency for motorists, we propose to mirror the local authority principle of higher parking charges in London. This reflects that deterrents vary in accordance with the economic geography of the country.</p>

<p>20.	We therefore proposed in the Code Enforcement Framework consultation that in London, the new parking charge caps will mirror Local Authority Band A. This means that on all types of private land (for example, customer car parks, residents’ car parks or private land where parking is not invited), Higher breaches can attract a charge of up to £130, while Lower breaches are liable to receive a charge of up to £80.</p>

<p>21.	Outside of London, our proposal is to mirror Local Authority Band 2 for the majority of private car parking spaces: car parks where parking is invited, either to any member of the public or to customers of public-facing business e.g. supermarkets or shopping centres. On these types of land, higher breaches of the terms and conditions, such as the abuse of customer parking or parking in a loading area, can incur a parking charge of up to £70 and Lower breaches up to £50.</p>

<p>22.	In keeping with creating greater consistency, we propose that parking operators will be required to offer a 50% discount if the parking charge is paid within 14 days. As respondents have argued, however, the discounted rate must still be higher than any parking tariff owed. Therefore, if the tariff owed is higher than the discounted level of the parking charge, payment of the full tariff may be sought.</p>

<p>23.	Furthermore, the government accepts that it is important to differentiate between types of private land. For example, car parks open to the public or to customers are a different case to private land where parking is not invited at all, or is clearly restricted to particular groups of motorist.</p>

<p>24.	We are therefore proposing exceptions in the parking charge system outside of London for land where parking is not invited or is restricted (often through the use of permits) to specific groups, for example private residents or staff. In these cases, outside London the current £100 cap will apply. This is in recognition that these types of land have no direct analogue in the local authority system and of the importance of balancing the rights of motorists with those of private landowners and residents. For London, the maximum £130 charge in these circumstance will apply.</p>

<p>25.	We propose that the level of parking charges is reviewed as part of the general review of the Code of Practice by the Scrutiny and Oversight Board which will take place every two years.</p>

<p>26.	The Scottish Government intends to align with the approach of bringing private parking charges closer to the principles of the Local Authority system. The approach in Wales will be confirmed as part of the process to finalise the Code of Practice.</p>

<p>27.	The proposed set of parking charge caps is set out below. Examples of breaches in the lower and higher levels can be found in paragraph 29.</p>

<p>28.	We propose that the list of breaches, and whether these attract the higher or lower level of parking charge, should follow the local authority system as closely as possible. Where we have departed from the local authority system, it is because certain breaches have no equivalent in civil parking enforcement, for example parking on land where parking is not invited at all, or to give particular protection for selected groups, such as residents.</p>

<p>29.	Below is a list of the off-street and relevant on-street contraventions from the local authority Standard <abbr title="Penalty Charge Notice">PCN</abbr> Codes v6.7.7 which are applicable on private land, together the levels – Higher and Lower. To achieve our objective of greater consistency, we propose that this model is mirrored in the new system for private parking charges. As there are some contraventions specific to private parking which are not covered by the local authority contraventions, we have added some additional private land contraventions at the Higher level.</p>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Debt collection fees</h2>

<p>31.	Currently, if a parking charge is not paid or appealed within 28 days, many parking operators add a further fee for debt collection services. It must, however, be brought to motorists’ attention in terms and conditions that additional fees may apply. The <abbr title="Accredited Trade Associations">ATAs</abbr> currently cap these fees at £70. Ultimately, if a parking charge goes unpaid, parking operators can take a motorist to the county court to seek a County Court Judgement (<abbr title="County Court Judgement">CCJ</abbr>).</p>

<p>32.	We have included the issue of debt collection in this consultation because it is a contentious area for many stakeholders. Moreover, the level of additional fees is part of the overall deterrent effect of any new system for parking charges and it is appropriate that we consult on both together.</p>

<p>33.	Government recognises that this is a sensitive area and that widespread concerns have been raised by consumer and motoring organisations about the fees and practices of some parking debt recovery agencies (<abbr title="debt recovery agencies">DRAs</abbr>).</p>

<p>34.	At the same time, we recognise that a system of deterrents is necessary for the efficient management of parking on private land. If a parking charge is legitimately issued, it is reasonable that motorists pay within the specified time periods and that there be some consequences for late or non-payment.</p>

<p>35.	We are guided by the following policy objectives in determining the new arrangements for debt collection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reduction in harm to motorists from aggressive and intimidating debt collection practices.</li>
  <li>A reduction in the number of CCJs against motorists, with negative and potentially life-changing impacts on credit scores.</li>
  <li>The provision of a sufficient deterrent against the non-payment of legitimately issued parking charges, enabling the fair and efficient management of parking spaces on private land.</li>
</ul>

<p>36.	To reduce harm to motorists, we propose to cap the level of debt recovery fees at the existing industry level £70. In setting this cap, we have taken into consideration the deterrent effect, the amount of court fees and the costs to operators of enforcing parking charges. We will keep the cap under review and will take these factors into consideration when setting it in future.</p>

<p>37.	Further, in the upcoming Code of Practice, the government will prohibit the use of misleading and intimidatory language by parking operators and <abbr title="debt recovery agencies">DRAs</abbr>. We will also oblige operators to provide information to motorists on where they can find free debt counselling and/or legal advice services.</p>

<p>38.	In addition, the Code of Practice will introduce new safeguards to ensure that any parking operator wishing to levy additional fees must bring this clearly to the attention of the motorist in any terms and conditions. For example, this will include a requirement to state the term visibly, ensure that the terms are displayed at multiple locations and are written in plain and intelligible language for the average consumer to understand.</p>

<p>39.	Moreover, the government proposes to require that all <abbr title="debt recovery agencies">DRAs</abbr> involved in the collection of private parking-related debt must be full members of an Accredited Parking Association (<abbr title="Accredited Parking Association">APA</abbr>) to ensure their accountability to the sector.</p>

<p>40.	To increase <abbr title="debt recovery agencies">DRAs</abbr> accountability to the government, we also propose that any company wishing to collect private parking debts (before or after the County Court stage) must be certified against a robust new Certification Scheme. Government will develop the Scheme in consultation with industry and motoring stakeholders, including the consumer and debt advice sector. This scheme will set out a clear pre-action protocol, including the reasonable steps that a <abbr title="debt recovery agency">DRA</abbr> must take to ascertain a motorists’ correct address. It will also set out clear standards of behaviour for <abbr title="debt recovery agencies">DRAs</abbr>, including higher expectations for the treatment of vulnerable people.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Appeals Charter</h2>

<p>41.	In the Code Enforcement Framework consultation, we outlined plans for an Appeals Charter. to ensure fairness, public confidence, transparency, proportionality and improved standards in the private parking sector.</p>

<p>42.	By an Appeals Charter, we mean a statement of the way parking operators should handle certain grounds of appeal based on innocent error or mitigating circumstances. This would be a safety net for motorists to ensure that parking charges are issued fairly by operators.</p>

<p>43.	The vast majority of respondents (at least 80%) were in agreement with the Appeals Charter. We are now seeking further views.</p>

<p>44.	The Appeals Charter sets out a minimum high-level standard. Operators will be expected to develop their own more detailed policies for considering challenges from motorists, including the standards of evidence accepted and the training of staff to ensure consistency of approach. These policies will be scrutinised by <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>-accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies (<abbr title="Conformity Assessment Bodies">CABs</abbr>) before parking operators are awarded Certification.</p>

<p>45.	Operators will have discretion in applying the Charter to individual cases. However, if a motorist is unhappy with the outcome of an appeal to the operator, they will have the right to refer the decision to the new independent Appeals Service. If the Appeals Service consistently considers appeals from an operator which suggest that they are not upholding the spirit of the Appeals Charter, this could be grounds for investigation by the <abbr title="Conformity Assessment Body">CAB</abbr> and/or the Scrutiny and Standards Board.</p>

<p>46.	There are a range of circumstances where the parking charge could be cancelled. These include, but are not limited, to points below:</p>

<p>a.	Motorist has paid the tariff but made a keying error when registering their vehicle (for example, 0 instead of o; I instead of L;1 instead of I; letters wrong or missing; characters swapped; motorist entered the wrong car registration (eg. their previous car or another vehicle from their household).</p>

<p>b.	Evidenced mitigation (for example, illness, accident, medical appointments, childcare, overrunning, unforeseen events).</p>

<p>c.	Evidenced vehicle breakdown</p>

<p>d.	Failure to display permit (copy of permit then supplied)</p>

<p>e.	Failure to display Blue Badge (copy of Blue Badge supplied)</p>

<p>f.	Failure to display Pay &amp; Display ticket (copy of ticket supplied)</p>

<p>g.	Exempt vehicle (eg. emergency vehicle)</p>

<p>h.	Payment machine out of operation (evidence supplied)</p>

<p>i.	Relevant operator breach of Code of Practice (evidence supplied)</p>
