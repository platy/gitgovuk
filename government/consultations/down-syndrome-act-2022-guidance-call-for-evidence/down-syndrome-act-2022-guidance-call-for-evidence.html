<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>This call for evidence will inform the development of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/18/enacted" rel="external">Down Syndrome Act</a> statutory guidance. We are seeking your views on what should be included within the guidance. We will consider those views when producing draft guidance which we intend to publish for full public consultation. We will provide more information on this in due course.</p>

<p>This call for evidence will run for a period of 16 weeks and is open to everyone. People under the age of 13 will need consent from a parent or guardian to submit their response.</p>

<p>You can respond:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as an individual</li>
  <li>on behalf of someone else</li>
  <li>on behalf of an organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>The call for evidence closes at 11.45pm on 8 November 2022.</p>

<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>We know that with the right support, people with Down’s syndrome can live independently and participate fully in society.</p>

<p>Although there are already legal duties and frameworks in place to ensure that services are tailored to people’s needs, we have heard that people with Down’s syndrome and their families often find it difficult to access the right support.</p>

<p>My nephew, Joseph, is one of the estimated 47,000 people in the UK who has Down’s syndrome. But my brother and sister-in-law have had to work incredibly hard to access the services that have made it possible for Joseph to thrive.</p>

<p>We need to raise awareness of the unique needs of people with Down’s syndrome and how they can be met.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/18/enacted" rel="external">Down Syndrome Act</a>, which received Royal Assent on 28 April 2022, aims to improve access to services and life outcomes for people with Down’s syndrome. I am grateful to the Rt Honourable Dr Liam Fox MP for bringing forward this important legislation. The Act requires government to develop and consult on guidance that authorities must have regard to when providing certain health, social care, education and housing services.</p>

<p>I am delighted to launch this national call for evidence which will inform the development of the draft guidance. We want to hear from people with Down’s syndrome, their families and carers regarding their experience of services. We also want to hear from professionals who work in health, social care, education and other local authority services, and the voluntary and charitable sector. In parallel, we will be engaging with people directly through workshops and focus groups.</p>

<p>We want to hear your views on the specific needs of people with Down’s syndrome, to what extent those needs are understood, and examples of best practice within health, social care, education and housing settings.</p>

<p>It is crucial that this guidance is fit for purpose so that we can ensure people with Down’s syndrome can access the support they need to thrive in their community. This call for evidence will be open for 16 weeks to ensure maximum engagement. This will allow us to collect invaluable information over the next few months, which will then be used to inform and support the production of the guidance. The draft guidance will in turn be published for full public consultation before final guidance is published next year.</p>

<p>Gillian Keegan
<br>
Minister of State for Care and Mental Health</p>

<h2>Down Syndrome Act guidance</h2>

<p>There are currently estimated to be around 47,000 people living in the UK with Down’s syndrome (Trisomy 21). Down’s syndrome is caused by having an extra copy of chromosome 21. People with Down’s syndrome will often have varying degrees of intellectual disabilities (mild to moderate), physical disabilities and other associated medical issues which will be different for each person.</p>

<p>People with Down’s syndrome are living longer. Their average life expectancy is now 60 years, which has significantly increased in recent years. With the right support, people with Down’s syndrome can live more independently, gain employment and contribute to their communities.</p>

<p>However, we know that people with Down’s syndrome can have poorer health outcomes compared with the general population and other people with a learning disability. People with Down’s syndrome and their families and carers can often struggle to access services such as speech and language therapy, additional educational support and appropriate levels of social care support.</p>

<p>The government is committed to ensuring that people with Down’s syndrome receive the care and support they need, to improve outcomes and help them to live longer, healthier and happier lives in their communities. We are clear that everyone with Down’s syndrome should receive early support to meet their needs, and families and carers should receive the help they need to enable them to guide their child’s development.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/18/enacted" rel="external">Down Syndrome Act 2022</a> became law in April 2022. The act represents a significant opportunity to improve the life outcomes of people with Down’s syndrome, and to raise the understanding and awareness of the specific needs of people with Down’s syndrome.</p>

<p>The Act requires the Secretary of State to publish guidance for relevant authorities (for example, NHS hospitals or local councils) on the steps it would be appropriate for those authorities to take to meet the needs of people with Down’s syndrome when carrying out some of their most important functions.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care is leading the cross-government work to develop the Down Syndrome Act guidance. This call for evidence asks people with Down’s syndrome, their families and carers, and professionals to put forward their views on what should be included within the guidance.</p>

<h2>About this call for evidence</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/18/enacted" rel="external">Down Syndrome Act 2022</a> became law in April 2022. The aim of the Down Syndrome Act is to improve access to services and to improve the quality of life for people with Down’s syndrome. It aims to ensure that health, social care, education and other local authority services such as housing take account of the specific needs of people with Down’s syndrome when commissioning or providing services.</p>

<p>The Act requires the Secretary of State to publish guidance for relevant authorities (for example, NHS hospitals or local councils) on the steps it would be appropriate for those authorities to take to meet the needs of people with Down’s syndrome when carrying out some of their most important functions. Once the guidance is published these authorities are legally required to take the guidance into account when providing certain core services.</p>

<p>We are launching this call for evidence to ask the public a range of questions to help us develop the guidance. In particular, we want to hear from people with Down’s syndrome, their families and carers about their experiences of a range of health and support services. We also want to hear from professionals who work in health, social care, education and other local authority services, and the voluntary and charitable sector.</p>

<p>We also want to hear your views on whether the guidance should cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the needs of people with other genetic conditions</li>
  <li>wider public services (other than health, social care, education, housing and youth offending)</li>
</ul>

<p>We made a commitment as the Down Syndrome bill was progressing through Parliament to consider whether the support needs of people with Down’s syndrome and people with a different or other genetic condition are similar. While the Down Syndrome Act is primarily about supporting people with Down’s syndrome, we want to test whether the guidance could have benefits for other people too. We would also like to hear from people with a different or other genetic condition, and their families and carers.</p>

<p>We will use ‘Down’s syndrome’ in all our documents and communications about the Down Syndrome Act. We know that some people prefer to use ‘Down syndrome’.</p>

<p>When we talk about other genetic condition’s we mean any other genetic condition where a person may require support with similar features to that for people with Down’s syndrome (for example a learning disability), where people would require the coordinated support of health, social care, education and other local authority services.</p>

<p>The questions in this call for evidence cover the following subject areas:</p>

<h3>Health services</h3>

<p>People with Down’s syndrome have an increased risk of some medical conditions including congenital heart disease, seizures, early onset dementia and leukaemia. They are also more susceptible to infections and more prone to hearing and visual impairments compared with the general population.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of the areas we will be asking questions about to do with health services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what support people with Down’s syndrome need to stay healthy</li>
  <li>if there are any barriers to accessing healthcare services</li>
  <li>access to advice and information</li>
  <li>whether organisations providing healthcare services understand their current legal obligations and duties</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adult social care</h3>

<p>Adults with Down’s syndrome may have social care support needs, this could be to enable them to live as independently as possible in their own home or stay safe and well.</p>

<p>Adult social care support covers a wide range of activities including personal care such as support for washing, dressing or cooking, as well as wider personalised support to enable people to stay engaged in their communities and live their lives the way they want to. This can include support with work, education or support to engage with and maintain personal relationships.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of the areas we will be asking questions about to do with adult social care:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do people with Down’s syndrome get the adult social care support they need?</li>
  <li>what are the specific adult social care needs of people with Down’s syndrome?</li>
  <li>what would professionals providing adult social care find most useful to be included in the guidance?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>Everyone has the right to try and live as independently as possible in their own home.</p>

<p>Supported housing is typically defined as a housing service where housing, support and/or care services are provided to help people to live as independently as possible. Supported housing provides homes for a wide range of people including older people, people with a learning disability and autistic people, and people with mental health related needs.</p>

<p>Below are some examples of the areas we will be asking questions about to do with housing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what do people with Down’s syndrome need to help them live independently?</li>
  <li>are people with Down’s syndrome, their families and carers aware of what support is available in their local area?</li>
  <li>do local councils understand the specialist housing needs in their local areas?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Education and children’s social care</h3>

<p>The Down Syndrome Act guidance will need to work within the wider Special Education Needs and Disabilities (<abbr title="Special Education Needs and Disabilities">SEND</abbr>) and Alternative Provision reforms as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/send-review-right-support-right-place-right-time">green paper consultation which closes on 22 July 2022</a>.</p>

<p>The main aim of the <abbr title="Special Education Needs and Disabilities">SEND</abbr> and alternative provision green paper is to ensure that children and young people with <abbr title="Special Education Needs and Disabilities">SEND</abbr> get the right support, in the right place, at the right time. It sets out proposals to improve early intervention, make clearer the support and services everyone (including people with Down’s syndrome) should expect and have funding and accountability systems in place which supports this. In combination, these measures should improve families’ experience of getting support and improve outcomes, as well as making the system more sustainable and resilient.</p>

<p>The guidance will also need to take account of children’s social care reforms. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/independent-review-of-childrens-social-care">Independent review of children’s social care</a> looked at whole-system reform and published its findings on 23 May 2022. The review put forward recommendations that aim to make support to disabled children more transparent and easier to access.</p>

<p>The government is considering the findings and recommendations from the independent review ahead of publishing an implementation strategy by the end of this year. We are fully committed to aligning children’s social care reform with the <abbr title="Special Education Needs and Disabilities">SEND</abbr> and alternative provision reforms and any other relevant existing work programmes across government so that we build a coherent system for all disabled children.</p>

<p>In light of the above consultation and independent review we have not included detailed questions about education and children’s social care in this call for evidence. However, we do invite respondents to provide examples of good practice they may have experienced.</p>

It will ensure that the guidance is evidence-based and reflects what people with Down’s syndrome, their families and carers and professionals tell us is important. We will publish progress updates on the work to development the guidance in due course.</p>

<h2>Privacy notice</h2>

<h3>Summary of initiative</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/18/enacted" rel="external">Down Syndrome Act 2022</a> became law in April 2022. The aim of the act is to improve access to services and the quality of life of people with Down’s syndrome. It aims to ensure that health, social care, education and other local authority services take account of the specific needs of people with Down’s syndrome when commissioning or providing services.</p>

<p>The act requires the Secretary of State to publish guidance for relevant authorities (for example NHS hospitals or local councils) on the steps it would be appropriate for those authorities to take to meet the needs of people with Down’s syndrome when carrying out their most important functions.</p>

<p>We are launching this call for evidence to ask the public a range of questions to help us develop the guidance. As part of this call for evidence we will be collecting responses which will contain data that we need to keep safe. This notice explains how we will do that.</p>

<h3>Data controller</h3>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is the data controller for the data you provide through our online form (hosted by a company we work with called SurveyOptic).</p>

<h3>What personal data we collect</h3>

<p>At the beginning of the survey we will ask you whether you are responding as an individual, on behalf of someone else, as an individual sharing your professional view, or on behalf of an organisation. We also ask if you or the person you are responding on behalf of has Down’s syndrome, or another genetic condition or learning disability which isn’t Down’s syndrome. If you are an individual sharing your professional view or responding on behalf of an organisation we will ask what sector you work in, and what the main area of focus of you work is.</p>

<p>We will then ask you your age. If you are responding and you are under the age of 13 you will need consent from a parent or guardian. Your parent or guardian will need to provide their name and email address to give consent. DHSC will not receive this information as all survey responses will be fully anonymised by SurveyOptic.</p>

<p>If you are responding and you are over the age of 13, we will give you the option to provide your email address and to tell us whether we can use it for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you need to contact us about amending or deleting your response</li>
  <li>if you do not have time to finish the survey and would like a reminder before it closes</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also be asked about your sex, gender identity, ethnicity, health status and the region of England you live in. You can select “prefer not to say” or leave a question blank if you do not want to provide this information. We only collect this data to analyse any trends and to make sure we have received responses from a broad range of people and organisations. We will not use this data to identify you for any other purpose.</p>

<p>We will also be asking other open questions with free text answer boxes. Please do not include any information that could directly identify you in these boxes. If we receive any responses which includes information which we think may identify you, we will seek to remove this information where possible.</p>

<h3>How we use your data (purposes)</h3>

<p>We are collecting this data to inform our call for evidence on the Down Syndrome Act guidance. All data will be treated in the strictest confidence.</p>

<p>We are collecting personal data for statistical purposes to help us understand how representative the results of the call for evidence are, and to identify any different views and experiences which may vary across demographic groups.</p>

<h3>Legal basis for processing personal data</h3>

<p>Under data protection law we need to tell you what our legal basis is for processing the data you are providing us with.</p>

<p>Under Article 6 of the United Kingdom Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the lawful basis we rely on for processing this information are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(a) your consent</li>
  <li>(e) necessary task in the public interest or controller’s official authority</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data processors and other recipients of personal data</h3>

<p>All responses to the call for evidence will be seen by people working in DHSC either in a policy team or as an analyst working on developing the Down Syndrome Act guidance. They will also be seen by SurveyOptic who are responsible for hosting and running the online survey on behalf of DHSC.</p>

<p>If we receive a large number of responses to the call for evidence we may need help from another organisation to analyse the responses, such as another government department.</p>

<p>If we do need the help of another government department we will only share anonymised data; we will ensure you are not identifiable from this data.</p>

<h3>International data transfers and storage locations</h3>

<p>Your data will be stored in the United Kingdom (UK). We have security procedures in place to make sure your data is safe and to make sure it doesn’t get lost or accessed by anyone who does not need to see it.</p>

<p>Storage of data by SurveyOptic is provided via secure servers located in the UK.</p>

<h3>Retention and disposal policy</h3>

<p>Your data will be held for 2 years from the closure of the call for evidence. After 2 years we will safely delete it.</p>

<h3>How we keep your data secure</h3>

<p>Both DHSC and SurveyOptic have security procedures in place to make sure your information is safe and to make sure it doesn’t get lost, accessed or misused by anyone who doesn’t need to see it.</p>

<p>This includes only allowing authorised persons access to your data via methods like password protection, encryption, and making sure the servers we use are secure. We have written procedures and policies in place which are regularly audited and reviewed by senior members of staff.</p>

<h3>Your rights as a data subject</h3>

<p>By law, you have a number of rights as a data subject and this processing does not take away or reduce these rights. The Data Protection Act 2018 and EU General Date Protection Regulations (2016/679) set out the following rights for you as an individual. Some of the rights won’t always be applicable and will depend on how your data is processed.</p>

<p>These rights are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the right to get copies of information – individuals have the right to ask for a copy of any information about them that is used</li>
  <li>the right to get information corrected – individuals have the right to ask for any information held about them that they think is inaccurate, to be corrected</li>
  <li>the right to limit how much the information is used – individuals have the right to ask for any of the information held about them to be restricted, for example, if they think inaccurate information is being used</li>
  <li>the right to object to the information being used – individuals can ask for any information held about them to not be used. However, this is not an absolute right, and continued use of the information may be necessary, with individuals being advised if this is the case</li>
  <li>the right to get information deleted – this is not an absolute right, and continued use of the information may be necessary, with individuals being advised if this is the case</li>
</ul>
