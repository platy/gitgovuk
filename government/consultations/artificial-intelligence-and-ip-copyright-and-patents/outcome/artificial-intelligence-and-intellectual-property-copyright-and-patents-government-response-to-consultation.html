<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (<abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) is a transformative technology, which is already revolutionising many areas of our lives. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/taskforce-on-innovation-growth-and-regulatory-reform-independent-report">Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform (TIGRR) report</a> urged UK leadership on <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. Unleashing the power of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is a top priority in the plan to be the most pro-tech Government ever. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy">National <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Strategy</a> sets out how the Government aims to secure the UK’s position amongst the global <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> superpowers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> can support innovation and creativity in a range of ways. It can be a tool for scientists, entrepreneurs, and artists, enabling new human inventions and creations. Some believe that <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will soon be inventing and creating things in ways that make it impossible to identify the human intellectual input in the final invention or work. Some feel this is happening now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intellectual property (<abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>) gives researchers, inventors, creators, and businesses the confidence to invest their time, energy and money in doing something new. UK business invests more than £130 billion a year in knowledge assets. <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> rights protect around £63 billion of this. These assets are vital to the industries that bring us the innovation and products that add value to our lives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government sought evidence and views on a range of options on how <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> should be dealt with in the patent and copyright systems. This response sets out the conclusions of that process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We considered three specific areas:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>copyright protection for computer-generated works (<abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr>) without a human author</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining (<abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>), which is often significant in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> use and development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patent protection for <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-devised inventions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6.
For computer-generated works, we plan no changes to the law. There is no evidence at present that protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> is harmful, and the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is still in its early stages. As such, a proper evaluation of the options is not possible, and any changes could have unintended consequences. We will keep the law under review and could amend, replace or remove protection in future if the evidence supports it.</p>

<p>7.
For text and data mining, we plan to introduce a new copyright and database exception which allows <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> for any purpose. Rights holders will still have safeguards to protect their content, including a requirement for lawful access.</p>

<p>8.
For <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-devised inventions we plan no change to UK patent law now. Most respondents felt that <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is not yet advanced enough to invent without human intervention. But we will keep this area of law under review to ensure that the UK patent system supports <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> innovation and the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in the UK. We will seek to advance <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> inventorship discussions internationally to support UK economic interests.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>9.
Unleashing innovation and creativity will be at the heart of the post-pandemic recovery and support British businesses to build back better. Innovation and creativity are also central to the Government’s levelling up plans.</p>

<p>10.
The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy">National <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Strategy</a> sets out how the Government aims to secure the UK’s position amongst the global <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> superpowers. This includes how the Government will invest in the long-term needs of the UK’s <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> ecosystem. Every sector and region can then benefit from the transition to an <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> economy by focusing on encouraging innovation whilst protecting the public.</p>

<p>11.
The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-innovation-strategy-leading-the-future-by-creating-it/uk-innovation-strategy-leading-the-future-by-creating-it-accessible-webpage">UK Innovation Strategy: leading the future by creating it</a> sets out our long-term plan for delivering innovation-led growth. Its primary aim is to boost private sector investment across the whole of the UK. This will ensure the right conditions for all businesses to innovate and give them the confidence to do so.</p>

<p>12.
Intellectual property (<abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr>) gives researchers, inventors, creators, and businesses the confidence to invest their time, energy and money in doing something new. It underpins economic growth by incentivising investment, safeguarding assets and enabling the sharing of know-how in technologies like artificial intelligence (<abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>). The benefits of <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> are not only for businesses’ bottom lines. There is investment in talented workers, regional clusters, the people, and communities who benefit from new ideas, products and entertainment. It also helps the nation’s standing on the world stage.</p>

<p>13.
<abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> has huge potential to rewrite the rules of whole industries. It can drive economic growth and transform all areas of life. The UK is a global superpower in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, well placed to lead over the next decade - a genuine research and innovation powerhouse. Our work on <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> supports the ambitions set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy">National <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Strategy</a>. The strategy will ensure the UK continues as a world leading location for research, development, commercialisation, and deployment of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<p>14.
We looked at the interaction between <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> and <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/artificial-intelligence-and-intellectual-property-call-for-views/government-response-to-call-for-views-on-artificial-intelligence-and-intellectual-property">Artificial Intelligence and intellectual property: call for views</a>. Several outcomes were identified as a result, including three areas that should be the subject of further consultation. These were covered in Government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/artificial-intelligence-and-ip-copyright-and-patents/artificial-intelligence-and-intellectual-property-copyright-and-patents">consultation of 29 October 2021</a> on how copyright and patent law can best support <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> development and deployment. We now set out the Government response to that consultation.</p>

<h2>About the consultation</h2>

<p>15.
This consultation sought evidence and views on a range of options on how the patent and copyright systems should deal with <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology.</p>

<p>16.
We consulted on three specific areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>copyright protection for computer-generated works without a human author. These are currently protected in the UK for 50 years. But should they be protected at all and if so, how?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining, which is often significant in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> use and development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patent protection for <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-devised inventions. Should we protect them, and if so, how should they be protected?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>17.
There are two overall objectives. The first is to encourage innovation in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology and promote its use for the public good. The second is to preserve the central role of intellectual property in promoting human creativity and innovation. To support these objectives, the consultation aimed to collect the best available economic evidence.</p>

<p>18.
We held six roundtables in November and December 2021. Participants included individuals, large and small businesses, and a range of organisations. Contributors were from sectors including the creative industries, tech industry, pharmaceuticals, the third sector, academia, and legal and <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> professions. More than 60 people participated in the roundtables and shared their experiences and thoughts. There were also 88 written submissions received. We also talked to <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> service/equipment providers, artists, entrepreneurs, inventors, academics and other <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> offices.</p>

<h2>Copyright in computer-generated works</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>19.
Computer-generated works (<abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr>) are copyright works without a human author. They are currently protected in UK copyright law. As part of our consultation, we asked whether they should continue to be protected and, if so, how. We also asked about related issues: the impacts of similar provisions in designs law, and risks of false attribution.</p>

<p>20.
61 written responses expressed a view on one or more of these issues. The majority favoured no change to the law (Option 0). Fewer respondents supported either of the other two options. Many, on all sides, said that there is little evidence of protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> having significant impacts at present.</p>

<p>21.
We have decided to adopt Option 0: make no changes to the law. There is no evidence at present that protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> is harmful, and the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is still in its early stages. As such, a proper evaluation of the options is not possible, and any changes could have unintended consequences. But we will keep the law under review and could amend, replace or remove protection in future if the evidence supports it.</p>

<h2>Options and responses</h2>

<p>21.
We received a broad range of written responses, including from trade associations in the publishing, technology, and music industries, academics, libraries, and cross-sector bodies.</p>

<p>22.
Most respondents agreed that protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> does not seem to be used widely at present. Several noted that there has been only one court case dealing with <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> and this did not involve <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. Some respondents said that users and developers of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> do rely on these protections. There was little supporting evidence for this.</p>

<p>Option 0: make no changes</p>

<p>24.
Many of those supporting Option 0 said that it would be premature to make changes. They said that there is no evidence that existing protection causes harms. But the longer-term implications of removing it are unclear. They also said doing so would remove legal certainty, while leaving the law unchanged offers stability. Some respondents who favoured Option 0 conceded that, as <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and its uses develop, this issue might need to be looked at again. Alternative approaches could become suitable in future.</p>

<p>Option 1: remove protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr></p>

<p>25.
Those who supported Option 1 included academics, research centres, and libraries. These respondents argued that the protection was not necessary or beneficial. Some raised concerns that ‘originality’, a necessary condition for protection, is unclear in the case of <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr>. Others noted that <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> systems can generate huge numbers of works. This means that protecting <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> could hamper innovation and crowd-out human creators and their works. They argued that removing protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> would promote and protect the status of human creativity.</p>

<p>Option 2: replace protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> with a new right of reduced scope or duration</p>

<p>26.
Some respondents supported Option 2. This was also the second preference of many who supported Options 0 and 1. They argued that a new right could be crafted to incentivise investment in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, whilst still promoting human creativity. Most of them suggested the right should have significantly shorter duration than copyright (such as two to ten years). But many respondents said that more evidence would be needed to decide on the scope and duration of a new right.</p>

<h2>Other CGW related issues</h2>

<p>27.
We also asked about the implications of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and our policy on <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> on protection for designs. Few responses addressed this question. No significant concerns were raised about the implications of protecting <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-generated material on the designs system.</p>

<p>28.
Many respondents gave views on the risks of <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> being falsely attributed to human authors. This might be for the extra term of protection available to human-authored works, or for reputational reasons. Several respondents raised concerns about this issue. But most considered that existing law would be adequate. In particular, respondents highlighted laws on passing off, fraud, privacy, and the need to establish authorship in cases of alleged copyright infringement. We agree with this assessment and do not see a need for intervention on this issue.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>29.
The Government has decided to adopt Option 0 and make no changes to existing protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr>. As the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to generate creative content is still in its early stages, the future impacts of this provision are uncertain. It is unclear whether removing it would either promote or discourage innovation and the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> for the public good.</p>

<p>30.
Therefore, we intend to monitor the impacts of existing protection as <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> develops further. This will include monitoring case law in this area, discussions with stakeholders, and through engagement with international partners. To that end, the IPO welcomes any new evidence stakeholders wish to provide in future on the effect of the CGW regime. We do not rule out changes to CGW protection in the future, should it be needed.</p>

<h2>Text and Data Mining</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>31.
Text and data mining (<abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>) means using computational techniques to analyse large amounts of information to identify patterns, trends and other useful information. <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> is used for training <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> systems, amongst other uses. It also has uses in research, journalism, marketing, business analytics and by cultural heritage organisations. The consultation outlined options in relation to text and data mining, which developers of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and other copyright users had identified in the call for views.</p>

<p>32.
Although factual data, trends and concepts are not protected by copyright, they are often embedded in copyright works. Data mining systems copy works to extract and analyse the data they contain. Unless permitted under licence or an exception, making such copies will constitute copyright infringement.</p>

<p>33.
Some rights holders license their works to allow <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>, but others do not. This has financial costs for people using data mining software. To reduce these costs for researchers, an exception to copyright for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> was introduced in 2014. This is set out in section 29A of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/29A" rel="external">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</a>. It is limited to non-commercial research, following EU rules which were in place at its creation.</p>

<p>34.
Several other countries have introduced copyright exceptions for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>. These encourage <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> development and other services to locate there. Territories with exceptions include the EU, Japan and Singapore. <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> may also be fair use under US law, depending on the facts.</p>

<p>35.
The consultation sought views on how to make it easier for people to data mine copyright materials. It did this with a view to supporting <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and wider innovation in the UK, in line with Government priorities on <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, data and innovation.</p>

<p>36.
65 respondents expressed a preference, with a spread of views across the responses. Almost no quantitative evidence was provided on the licensing environment or other questions.</p>

<p>37.
Rights holders favoured no change or licensing solutions to help make more material available for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>. Users of copyright and database material favoured a wider exception. They highlighted the costs of licensing and difficulties in obtaining licences, especially when many rights holders are involved.</p>

<p>38.
The Government has decided to introduce a new copyright and database exception which allows <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> for any purpose, along the lines of Option 4. This option is the most supportive of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and wider innovation.</p>

<h2>Options and responses</h2>

<p>39.
Responses on <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> were received from individuals, academics, lawyers, representative and trade organisations, and businesses involved in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> or with an interest in <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>. We have also considered views expressed at the roundtables held during the consultation period.</p>

<p>40.
Many rights holders stated that there was no evidence of a problem, so licensing should continue to be controlled by rights holders. They were against changes to copyright exceptions. They said that commercial uses of <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> should be licensed, especially outside of scientific research. Some music rights holders argued that music cannot and should not be reduced to data for the purposes of mining. While we respect the creativity involved in copyright and databases, there are datasets in all types of work.</p>

<p>41.
Users said that exceptions are the best way to reduce the cost of <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>. Licences can price users out of the market, due to the cost of the licence or the complexity of identifying and agreeing licences with many rights holders. Some users highlighted more attractive conditions in other countries for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> where broad exceptions already exist.</p>

<p>Option 0: make no legal change</p>

<p>42.
Some rights holders argued that there is no quantitative evidence of a need for an exception beyond the one for non-commercial research. They concluded that, in absence of such evidence, the rights holders should be left to control access to data through licensing.</p>

<p>Option 1: improve licensing environment for the purposes of <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr></p>

<p>43.
The consultation asked specific questions on the licensing environment, but rights holders did not provide quantitative evidence for this. However, some rights holders described licensing arrangements in place in the market. Some rights holders indicated that they had never refused to issue a licence for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>. They argued that licensing revenue helps to support the investment needed for curation to make quality data available for mining.</p>

<p>44.
Users had mixed experiences with <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> licensing. Some had been priced out of licensing for research projects which have restricted funding. Others indicated that licensing was costly and unworkable when mining content from large numbers of individual rights holders.</p>

<p>45.
Various respondents suggested ideas for improving licensing. Some do not need Government intervention and could be taken forward by the market. These include a pilot licensing scheme for small <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> developers to access scientific and technical material. Collective licensing could be considered where rights holders are represented by collective management organisations (CMOs).</p>

<p>46.
Licensing suggestions with limited Government intervention included the creation of a code of practice for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> or model licensing terms. It was also suggested to consider better education about licensing in general. These ideas could be achieved through partnership between Government, users and rights holders.</p>

<p>47.
Some users thought that a compulsory licensing scheme for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> might be preferable.</p>

<p>Options 2-4: <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> exceptions</p>

<p>48.
There were three options in relation to a <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> exception. Option 2 was to extend the existing <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> exception to cover commercial research. Option 3 was to adopt a <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> exception for any purpose, with a rights holder opt-out. Option 4 was to adopt a <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> exception for any purpose, which does not allow rights holders to opt out. All options would apply to database right as well as copyright.</p>

<p>49.
As most respondents discussed the options for exceptions together, we have grouped them in this response.</p>

<p>50.
Rights holders were broadly against the introduction of new exceptions. They argued that it interfered with their rights to exploit their works. They also said that it could lead to a decline in the creation and curation of datasets for mining, as they could not license them.</p>

<p>51.
Some rights holder respondents indicated that a limited new exception might be acceptable. It should still allow licensing for commercial uses. Some referred to the EU’s data mining exception and the UK’s education exceptions as examples of these.</p>

<p>52.
Users generally preferred an exception because it removes the need for licensing. Some respondents felt that an opt-out for rights holders might be appropriate, but the detail of this would be critical. Any opt-out would need to be entirely machine readable to make the exception workable. Several also pointed out the less favourable system in the UK compared with other <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-leading nations with exceptions. The legal framework in any particular country, including the UK, plays a part in investment decisions. Some users suggested that investors would choose to support <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> projects in other countries because of the current limited UK framework.</p>

<p>53.
Under option 3, we asked specific questions in relation to the new <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> exception in the EU which contains a rights holder opt-out. Many respondents said that some member states have still not implemented the relevant Directive. So, it is too early to say how it is operating. The opt-out is intended to be machine readable and easy to use, and discussions on appropriate methods are still at an early stage. Some rights holders objected to the opt-out all together, as it places the burden on them rather than the user. They said it would be easier to remove their works from the public completely rather than have a machine readable opt-out.</p>

<h2>Other data mining issues</h2>

<p>54.
Respondents to the consultation raised issues related with data mining, including data protection. The uses of data other than under the copyright framework are outside the scope of this consultation.</p>

<p>55.
Data ethics and standards were other areas of interest for respondents. Ethical questions can relate to personal data and what data should be used for training <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and other <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> uses. Data ethics are often considered in relation to scientific research. Standards questions concerned formats and types of data, which can vary even in the same type of copyright work, for example. The regulation of data standards and data ethics are not a part of the copyright framework and are outside the scope of this consultation.</p>

<p>56.
Some respondents suggested tax incentives for <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> developers to reduce costs. This should help them buy licences from rights holders. Taxation policy is outside the scope of this consultation.</p>

<p>57.
Some respondents felt that the introduction of an exception under options 3 and 4 would lead to unfair competition in some sectors. Competition issues are generally a matter for the Competition and Markets Authority. However, the economic impact of exceptions on both users and rights holders will be in the impact assessment accompanying any legislation.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>58.
The Government has decided to introduce a new copyright and database right exception which allows <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> for any purpose. The Government will identify suitable legislation to make the required changes in due course.</p>

<p>59.
Introducing an exception which applies to commercial <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> will bring benefits to a wide range of stakeholders in the UK. These include researchers, <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> developers, small businesses, cultural heritage institutions, journalists, and engaged citizens. Targeted products and services will benefit businesses and customers. Research outcomes could also benefit the wider public. This could be, for example, by supporting research and innovation in public health. Some in the creative industries also use <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> and <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to understand their market or create new works – they will also see benefits. The benefits will be reducing the time needed to obtain permission from multiple rights holders and no licence fee to pay. This will speed up the <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> process and development of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<p>60.
These changes make the most of the greater flexibilities following Brexit. They will help make the UK more competitive as a location for firms doing data mining.</p>

<p>61.
Rights holders will no longer be able to charge for UK licences for <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> and will not be able to contract or opt-out of the exception. The new provision may also affect those who have built partial business models around data licensing. However, rights holders will still have safeguards to protect their content. The main safeguard will be the requirement for lawful access. That is, rights holders can choose the platform where they make their works available, including charging for access via subscription or single charge. They will also be able to take measures to ensure the integrity and security of their systems.</p>

<p>62.
The Government’s ambition is to make the UK a global centre for <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> innovation. The new exception will ensure the UK’s copyright laws are among the most innovation-friendly in the world. All users of data mining technology will benefit, with rights holders having safeguards to protect their content.</p>

<h2>Patents</h2>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>63.
We received 48 written responses that expressed a view on patents and <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> inventorship. Respondents included <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> developers, the pharmaceutical sector, small businesses, academics, and legal and <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> professionals. Respondents had mixed views on the options proposed in the consultation. The majority preferred no unilateral change in UK law for now (Option 0). There were no trends in preferences for any options according to industry sector, business size or business model. The majority of respondents consider <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is an assistive tool. Many stated that inventions developed using <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> are protected enough by the current law.</p>

<p>64.
The views expressed in the roundtables are in line with the consultation responses. That is, there should be no legal change to UK patent law and any future change would need to be at an international level.</p>

<p>65.
We have decided to adopt Option 0: make no changes to the law. There is no evidence that UK patent law is currently inappropriate to protect inventions made using <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. We are also sensitive to concerns that unilateral change now, risks being counterproductive. So, we will advance international discussion so that inventions devised by <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> are appropriately protected in the future.</p>

<h2>Patents options</h2>

<p>66.
The proposals for legal change featured in the consultation raised concerns with respondents. The majority of respondents highlighted issues around diverging from international norms on inventorship. They felt a change only in UK law would prejudice international patent filings in markets that are important for UK interests. Many respondents who supported legal change urged the UK to take the lead in this area. However, most respondents agreed that any change to the law on inventorship must be harmonised internationally.</p>

<p>67.
Some people said that rules will need to change to take account of the increasing contribution of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in the research and development process. This view was a particular concern of the pharmaceutical industry. Many respondents felt that once <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> reaches a stage where it could invent, any inventions devised by that <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> should be patentable. But respondents from the tech sector acknowledged that <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is not yet advanced enough to invent without human intervention.</p>

<p>68.
Most respondents share the view that there is limited technological, legal, and economic evidence for legal change at present. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is no consensus on who should own patents when <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is the inventor</li>
  <li>respondents consider the technological case for change may be stronger in the future</li>
  <li>international harmonisation is seen as a prerequisite to successful change</li>
  <li>the majority took the view that a unilateral change to UK legislation would be premature and may be negative for the UK’s innovation landscape</li>
</ul>

<p>Option 0 – No legal change</p>

<p>69.
Most comments state that no legal change is the best option at the moment. Almost all respondents share the view that <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is a tool used by human inventors. Many respondents believe <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is not capable of inventing without significant human intervention. Many respondents believe the current <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> framework protects <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-assisted inventions enough.</p>

<p>70.
Most respondents agreed that future developments in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> may require legislative changes at an international level to protect inventions devised by <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. There is no clear time scale for technological developments in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. Some respondents from the pharmaceutical sector felt that the law should stay ahead of technological developments. The UK should be pro-active in this area. Many thought there is a risk that inventions made using <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will not qualify for patent protection in future.</p>

<p>Option 1 – Expand the definition of inventor</p>

<p>71.
For those who supported legal change, the majority supported Option 1 over Options 2 and 3. Under Option 1, the definition of inventor would be expanded to allow humans responsible for the <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to be named inventor. Some respondents felt this option would be more palatable at an international level. Others were critical of this option and felt it would be disingenuous to name a human inventor where <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is the sole deviser.</p>

<p>72.
There was no consensus on how to do this without detrimental ownership consequences. Many supported applying a test for inventorship that the inventor is the person who made the necessary arrangements for the creation of the invention. Ownership would then be decided in the usual way. Others proposed an adaption of the current employer/employee relationship. Some respondents suggested that contracts should settle issues of patent ownership.</p>

<p>Option 2 – Allow <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to be named as inventor or remove requirements to name an <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> inventor</p>

<p>73.
Option 2 would allow an applicant to name <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> as inventor. A few supported this option but only if legal change were implemented internationally. Many expressed the view that a premature change by the UK would significantly affect an applicant’s global filing strategy. It may lead to a scenario whereby an invention can only gain patent protection in the UK.</p>

<p>74.
Representatives of <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> suggested that Option 2, may have a negative financial impact on small businesses. A small business may incur greater legal costs when seeking advice on global filing strategies and compliance with UK inventorship rules. Patent entitlement, which stems from inventorship, was highlighted as an additional concern for <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>. Many <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> worry that a change in the law may allow a third-party <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> developer to claim inventorship rights over their invention.</p>

<p>75.
The small number advocating for a change in the law argued that Option 2 would encourage innovation and investment in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology. Some said that allowing <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to be named as the inventor would incentivise the development of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and make inventive <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> a valuable commodity. Many felt the need for transparency is important where <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> has made a significant contribution to an invention. Very few supported the option to remove the obligation to name an inventor.</p>

<p>Option 3 – New patent-like right to protect inventions devised by <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></p>

<p>76.
The option to introduce a patent-related right was only supported by few respondents. The consultation did not give a clear picture of how this option should be implemented to best support the UK economy. A small number identify some benefits of introducing a new intellectual property right. Some stated that it may provide the opportunity to create a bespoke, flexible regime for <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> devised inventions. Others noted it may provide an opportunity for the UK to better understand <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>’s contributions to innovation. A new patent-like right may also give <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology the chance to develop whilst benefiting from registered <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> protection.</p>

<p>77.
Most respondents felt introducing a new right for inventions devised by <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> would create unnecessary conflict and confusion with the current patent system. Some argued it would fragment an already complex <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> landscape.</p>

<h2>Other Patent issues</h2>

<p>78.
We are concerned that the recent publicity about naming an <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> system as an inventor risks the incorrect conclusion that UK patent law does not protect <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-assisted inventions. A patent may in fact be granted for an <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-assisted invention provided the application satisfies the legal requirements set out in the UK Patents Act 1977.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>79.
The Government will make no change to UK patent legislation now. Most respondents agree current UK patent rules on inventorship are enough to protect <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-assisted inventions. Many share the view that any change to rules on inventorship should be harmonised at an international level. We will therefore seek to advance <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> inventorship discussions internationally to support UK economic interests and competitive edge.&nbsp;We will need to understand how our <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> system should protect <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-devised inventions in the future.</p>

<p>80.
The Government does not want to risk creating barriers to innovation and investment in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology. We will need to be on the front foot of technological developments in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. We will take forward the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advance <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> inventorship harmonisation discussions in international fora</li>
  <li>develop a clear picture of what the UK should seek in harmonisation discussions, through:<br>
(i) Understanding the existing and potential strengths of the UK economy, and what would reinforce UK competitive advantage; and<br>
(ii) Actively monitoring technological developments in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>’s use in the innovation process by building on relationships formed during the consultation</li>
  <li>seek to address any perceptions that the current law prevents the patenting of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-assisted inventions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other issues raised by respondents</h2>

<p>81.
Many feel there needs to be a broader ethical and moral debate on whether <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> should be recognised as a legal personality. This is not a problem which can be resolved in <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> law and falls outside the scope of this consultation.</p>

<p>82.
Some respondents raised concerns about the impact of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> on performers. This includes concerns that computer-generated performances might replace human performers. The effect on audio performances (such as audio-book narration and voice-overs) was a particular worry. There are also concerns that computer-generated performances provide greater opportunities for using performers’ images, voices or likenesses without permission. For example, in ‘deepfakes’. Some stakeholders called for an expansion of the scope of performers’ rights in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to address these issues.</p>

<p>83.
We take these views seriously. But, at this stage, the impacts of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies on performers remain unclear. It is also unclear whether and how existing law (both in the <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> framework and beyond it) is insufficient to address any issues. If intervention is necessary, the <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> framework may not be the best vehicle for this. We will keep these issues under review from an <abbr title="Intellectual property">IP</abbr> perspective.</p>

<h2>Overall conclusion</h2>

<p>84.
The Government considered three specific areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>copyright protection for computer-generated works (<abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr>) without a human author</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>licensing or exceptions to copyright for text and data mining (<abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr>), which is often significant in <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> use and development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patent protection for <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-devised inventions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>85.
For computer-generated works, we plan no changes to the law. There is no evidence at present that protection for <abbr title="computer-generated works">CGWs</abbr> is harmful, and the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is still in its early stages. As such, a proper evaluation of the options is not possible, and any changes could have unintended consequences. We will keep the law under review and could amend, replace or remove protection in future if the evidence supports it.</p>

<p>86.
For text and data mining, we plan to introduce a new copyright and database exception which allows <abbr title="text and data mining">TDM</abbr> for any purpose. Rights holders will still have safeguards to protect their content, including a requirement for lawful access.</p>

<p>87.
For <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>-devised inventions, we plan no change to UK patent law. But we will keep this area of law under review to ensure that the UK patent system supports <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> innovation and the use of <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in the UK. We will seek to advance <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> inventorship discussions internationally to support UK economic interests.</p>
