<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>Flood risk management plans (FRMPs) are strategic plans that set out how to manage flood risk in nationally identified flood risk areas (FRAs).</p>

<p>They are statutory plans required by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3042/made" rel="external">Flood Risk Regulations 2009</a>, and must be reviewed by the Environment Agency and lead local flood authorities (LLFAs) every 6 years.</p>

<p>The first FRMPs were published in March 2016. They contain actions to manage flood risk across England between 2015 to 2021. The new set of plans will cover 2021 to 2027.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency worked together with lead local flood authorities (LLFAs) and other risk management authorities (RMAs) to produce draft FRMPs for public consultation.</p>

<p>As required by the Flood Risk Regulations 2009, a public consultation on the draft FRMPs for 2021 to 2027 ran from 22 October 2021 to 21 January 2022. The primary purpose of the consultation was to gather views and comments from a wide range of stakeholders to help inform a final set of plans and actions to manage flood risk between 2021 to 2027.</p>

<p>We have summarised the responses both nationally and by the 10 river basin districts which each have their own plan. To see the summary of a particular river basin district, select the relevant link:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>FRMPs in context</h3>

<p>It is important to put FRMPs into the context in which they are being updated. There are over 5.2 million homes and businesses in England at risk of flooding and coastal erosion. FRMPs will help to create a better place for people and wildlife.</p>

<p>With a rapidly changing climate, the need to plan together to improve the overall resilience of our local places is more important than ever before. The more we plan together and work in partnership, the more we can provide together for local people, places and our environment.</p>

<p>The plans will also help to inform and push ahead existing programmes of work, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/programme-of-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-schemes">Programme of flood and coastal erosion risk management schemes</a>, and work with local communities to improve resilience. They aim to support and contribute to the delivery of the ambitions in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2">National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England</a> (FCERM strategy), such as nature-based solutions, and longer term adaptive approaches for taking action at the right time.</p>

<p>They are one of several plans which set out how the flood and water environment is managed, including the FCERM Strategy, river basin management plans, shoreline management plans, local flood risk management strategies, and drainage and wastewater management plans.</p>

<p>We have coordinated the preparation of the draft FRMPs with draft river basin management plans (RBMPs) to encourage better join-up in the management of flood risk and the water environment. RBMPs set out how organisations, stakeholders and communities will work together to protect and improve the water environment to 2027.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/environment-and-business/draft-river-basin-management-plans/" rel="external">consultation on the draft RBMPs</a> also opened on 22 October 2021 to make it easier for respondents to view the plans side by side. The RBMPs consultation closed on 22 April 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>What is the summary of responses?</h3>

<p>This document is a summary of the consultation responses, following a review and analysis by the Environment Agency. It doesn't include all responses but gives a broad representation of the ones received.</p>

<p>A full set of responses, from those who gave their permission for their feedback to be published, can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/fcrm/draft-second-cycle-flood-risk-management-plans/consultation/published_select_respondent" rel="external">Citizen Space</a>. All personal information has been omitted from these published responses.</p>

<p>All responses received will be considered as we write the final set of plans. We will also publish a 'You Said, We Did' document later in the year, which will set out in more detail how we acted on the responses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Consultation process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>What was consulted on?</h3>

<p>The consultation included several documents, drafted by the Environment Agency and LLFAs and made available on the online consultation tool, Citizen Space.</p>

<p>These were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part A: High level overview of the FRMPs and flood risk management in England for 2021 to 2027</li>
  <li>Part B: 10 draft FRMPs, one for each river basin district, including an overview of the approach taken, a summary of the flood risk, and the impact of climate change.</li>
  <li>Flood Plan Explorer: A new interactive mapping tool, where you can discover information about all the proposed FRMP measures.</li>
  <li>strategic environmental assessment reports:  The findings of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). An SEA was undertaken for each FRMP to ensure that environmental effects were considered during the development of the plans</li>
  <li>strategic environmental assessment non-technical summaries: A clear summary of the SEA report, and its findings</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>What questions were asked?</h3>

<p>We asked a number of questions across several themes to obtain feedback. These were:</p>

<h4>Strategic measures</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Question 5 - The draft FRMPs set out a number of strategic measures to manage flood risk in identified flood risk areas. Do you agree with these measures?</li>
  <li>Question 6 - The draft FRMPs set out a number of strategic measures to manage flood risk outside of identified flood risk areas. If applicable to the FRMP you are responding to, do you agree with these measures?</li>
</ul>

<h4>FCERM strategy and climate change</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Question 7 -To what extent do you think the objectives and measures set out in the draft Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) support and contribute to the delivery of the ambitions in the National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy (FCERM Strategy)?</li>
  <li>Question 8 - To what extent do the measures in the draft FRMPs help to deliver multiple benefits for both flood risk management and the wider water environment?</li>
  <li>Question 9 - To what extent do you agree that the draft FRMPs consider the likely impacts of flood risk associated with climate change?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Flood Plan Explorer</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Question 10 - How easy did you find using flood plan explorer when looking for draft flood risk management plan (FRMP) measures?</li>
  <li>Question 11 - What improvements, if any, would you make to flood plan explorer?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your experience and supporting delivery</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Question 12 - Overall, how would you describe your experience of finding the information you were looking for within the draft flood risk management plans (FRMPs) and flood plan explorer?</li>
  <li>Question 13 - In what ways do you think you could support the delivery of the measures as set out in the draft FRMPs?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Strategic environmental assessments</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Question 14 - Do you agree with the conclusions of the environmental assessment?</li>
  <li>Question 15 - Are there further significant environmental effects, either positive or negative, of the draft flood risk management plans (FRMPs) which you think should be considered?</li>
  <li>Question 16 - Are there further opportunities to enhance any positive or mitigate any negative environmental effects that should be considered for the final FRMPs?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>How was the consultation run?</h3>

<p>We worked in partnership with stakeholders, listening and gathering views on the FRMPs.</p>

<p>Prior to the consultation, the Environment Agency and LLFAs worked with a wide range of stakeholders to help promote the draft FRMPs consultation. This included local government, the water industry, the farming industry, catchment partnerships and regional flood and coastal committees. The aim was to introduce the FRMPs, to show why they were important to them, and why they should respond.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency engaged with stakeholders through its national and area teams. Area teams worked closely with their LLFAs and local stakeholders to promote the consultation and develop draft measures. We carried out several joint stakeholder events both internally and externally to show the co-ordination between FRMPs and RBMPs.</p>

<p>Some examples of the organisations we engaged are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regional Flood and Coastal Committees (RFCCs)</li>
  <li>the RFCC conservation members</li>
  <li>Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT), lead local flood authorities (LLFAs)</li>
  <li>Coastal Partnerships</li>
  <li>National Farmers Union (NFU)</li>
  <li>National Flood Forum</li>
  <li>Marine Management Organisation, Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Association of Drainage Authorities</li>
  <li>Catchment-Based Approach (CaBA)</li>
  <li>Local Government Association</li>
  <li>London Drainage Engineers Group</li>
  <li>Natural Resources Wales</li>
  <li>Scottish Environment Protection Agency</li>
</ul>

<p>We communicated through newsletters, mailouts, press release on GOV.UK, and social media (Twitter and Facebook). LLFAs also promoted the consultation via their own websites and social media accounts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Executive summary of responses</h2>

<p>We received 255 responses in total, of which 42 were from members of the public and 190 from organisations. The chart below shows the breakdown of responses.</p>

</ul>

<p>Note: The total number of responses does not match the sum of the organisational and individual responses as some organisations submitted more than one response. There was also one unknown response.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Main themes</h3>

<p>The main themes raised in the responses, were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>partnerships – the value of working in partnership to plan and deliver flood risk management solutions</li>
  <li>engagement – the value of engagement and working in partnership with all organisations and government departments</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions – support for the implementation of nature-based solutions, including natural flood management techniques, so more biodiversity and environmental benefits can be delivered across the flood and water environment</li>
  <li>catchment-based approach – support for and a greater emphasis on this for flood risk management</li>
  <li>alignment - the need to align with other plans and strategies so delivery is effective, for example, local nature recovery strategies, and shoreline management plans</li>
  <li>land management – the need to consider all land uses, when assessing and managing flood risk, including the benefits of agricultural land</li>
  <li>climate change and adaptation – the importance of working together across all organisations to adapt and having better information on factors such as the carbon footprint of the measures.</li>
  <li>funding – the need to identify funding and resources for timely delivery of measures</li>
  <li>readability – the ability to find information in the plans and within flood plan explorer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> these themes are not exclusive or listed in any order.</p>

<p>Overall, there was a broad support for the information and measures included in the FRMPs. A breakdown of the feedback we received is shown in figure 3.2.</p>

<span class="number">4.1 </span>Main themes</h3>

<p>The themes from the national responses were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support and implementation of nature-based solutions, including natural flood management techniques, biodiversity net gain and achieving environmental benefits across the flood and water environment</li>
  <li>the need to use a catchment-based approach for flood risk management</li>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>A summary of responses to each consultation question</h3>

<h4>Question 5: strategic measures in flood risk areas (FRAs).</h4>

<p>Points raised in the responses included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nature-based solutions - support for nature-based solutions across the whole catchment including managing existing and new woodland. Natural flood management projects should be considered as part of all flood schemes</li>
  <li>funding – the funding for flood risk management assets and their maintenance should be set out more clearly in the plans</li>
  <li>partnership and engagement – early engagement and partnership working with landowners, communities and risk management authorities is important for the successful delivering of measures and ambitions in the plans</li>
  <li>links with other plans and strategies– FRMPs should show how they link with other plans, such as local nature recovery strategies (LNRS), drainage and wastewater management plans (DWMPs), shoreline management plans (SMPs) local flood risk management strategies (LFRMS), environmental land management schemes (ELMs), catchment sensitive farming (CSF) and work to address flooding from surface water</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 6: strategic measures outside of flood risk areas (FRAs)</h4>

<p>There were similar points raised for this question, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nature-based solutions – the need for natural flood management, tree planting, and taking a catchment-based approach in places outside of FRAs</li>
  <li>local flood risk measures – it is important to manage flood risk outside of FRAs by working with communities on flood schemes and identifying local measures</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 7: FCERM strategy</h4>

<p>Issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>catchment-based approach – FRMPs should have a greater emphasis on the catchment-based approach</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions – to align more with the FCERM strategy, FRMPs should specifically reference nature-based solutions in the objectives, including coastal habitat restoration</li>
  <li>links with other plans and strategies – being clearer how the FRMPs and the measures deliver the FCERM strategy, as well as to support and align with other plans (for example, DWMPs and SMPs)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 8: delivering multiple benefits</h4>

<p>Topics raised in the responses included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delivery and action – taking the opportunity to deliver genuine and additional benefits for communities and the environment through flood risk management, infrastructure, and local environmental projects</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions – support for nature-based solutions in the plans as they can also deliver multiple benefits in river basin management plans and local nature recovery strategies. An opportunity to improve delivery through stronger links to carbon and biodiversity net gain</li>
  <li>agricultural benefits – that the farming community and the benefits that agriculture brings should be better represented in the plans</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 9: considering the likely impacts of climate change</h4>

<p>The following points were made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>climate modelling – more detail is needed on climate modelling to determine if the measures address climate changes predictions</li>
  <li>climate resilient places – the plans benefitted from the inclusion of climate change information and aligning the objectives with the FCERM strategy</li>
  <li>Net zero – the FRMPs should demonstrate how objectives could be delivered whilst supporting the net zero carbon agenda</li>
  <li>coastal habitats – the need for more detail on how the plans will address loss of habitat due to coastal erosion</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 10 to 11: using flood plan explorer</h4>

<p>Issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mapping – the inclusion of separate maps for river basin districts, FRAs and strategic areas are helpful, although the data is sometimes hard to understand. A tool to compare the different FRMPs at a high-level would be helpful</li>
  <li>measuring success and links to other measures – flood plan explorer is a helpful tool to judge the success of measures. It would be useful to link to other data explorers to see related data, such as water quality measures</li>
  <li>summary of plans – a summary of the plans within flood plan explorer would have helped inform consultation responses</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 12: finding FRMP information</h4>

<p>Overall respondents felt that there was too much documentation and clear summaries were needed for each section.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>The topics covered in the responses included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identification of priority catchments – partnership working will be essential with organisations that can help to deliver measures, such as woodland creation, inland and coastal habitat creation, and water quality. Prioritising catchments for these activities will make partnership working more effective</li>
  <li>partnerships and engagement - partnership working is needed to improve the resilience of assets and infrastructure. During the delivery phase more engagement with landowners and rural businesses is needed to understand the impacts of measures</li>
  <li>use of flood plan explorer – is a powerful tool that will help to identify areas where measures are needed and can be promoted locally</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>Many of the responses received in relation to the Strategic Environmental Assessment Environmental Reports relate to the content and measures within the FRMP. The topics raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>historic environment – there is an important link between the historic environment and natural flood management, and there are opportunities for the historic environment to support this. It is important to consider how FRMP measures impact on historic landscape character and sense of place, as well as specific designated assets. Strategic mitigation measures should be included</li>
  <li>biodiversity and designated sites – a habitats regulations assessment should be undertaken, with the results feeding into the final FRMP and SEA. It is important to consider the impact of the FRMP on protected sites, priority habitats and protected species</li>
  <li>agriculture and land management – impact on food production is a key consideration, and there needs to be a balance between natural flood management and agricultural land loss. Agriculture can support multiple benefits including carbon, biodiversity, and natural flood management</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions – support for nature-based solutions, including natural flood management techniques, habitat restoration, and use of woodland where appropriate.</li>
  <li>catchment-based approach – this is seen as very important to delivering nature-based solutions and looking at flood risk management holistically. There is a need for collaborative working to maximise the benefits of this approach.</li>
  <li>plans, policies and programmes review – additional plans, policies and programmes for consideration were proposed by some stakeholders</li>
  <li>links with other plans or projects – greater clarity is needed with regards to how the FRMPs fit with other plans (including the FCERM strategy and RBMPs) and at a project level. Clear links should be made with the nature recovery networks and local nature recovery strategies</li>
  <li>planning - final FRMPs should underpin reforms to the planning system, with more commitment to sustainable drainage systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the points raised in the responses included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>although there was a request to mention the Water Framework Directive more, it was recognised that the plan's measures generally support the protection or enhancement of the water environment</li>
  <li>there were questions raised about how delivery of wider benefits would be monitored, whilst acknowledging the difficulty in assessing the impact of those benefits</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 9: considering the likely impacts of climate change</h4>

<p>Again, most respondents who answered the question agreed totally or partially.</p>

    <p>being clearer on how the measures would manage residual flood risk and contribute to the climate emergency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there were calls for more research into understanding the impacts of climate change and a better understanding of how changing land use could be part of the solution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 10 to 11: using flood plan explorer (FPE)</h4>

<p>The overall experience reported by users of FPE was positive. Responses also suggested some improvements to the navigation and search functions.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5.7: How easy did consultees find using the flood plan explorer to find measures?</strong></p>

<p>However, there were also comments that the documents were too large making it harder to find information quickly.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>Some points raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the opportunity to work in partnership and support the delivery of FRMPs was welcomed</li>
  <li>more engagement with risk management authorities (RMAs) and farmers was suggested to improve the delivery of FRMP measures</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>Not all respondents answered the SEA question. Although there seems to be a general agreement with the conclusions of the SEA, the lack of detail at this stage and a need for further assessments as plans or projects progress were identified.</p>

<p>There was a suggestion to strengthen the links between the FRMPs and flood plan explorer so that the context from the plans is not lost while browsing different measures on the flood plan explorer.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>The need to maintain strong partnerships across all organisations working on flood risk management was raised.</p>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>The 2 answers we received show a degree of agreement with the conclusions of the SEA. Respondents suggested to see an assessment to quantify the potential impacts of the proposed measures on the environment to prioritise them.</p>

<p>However, consultees also explained that there was a lot of information to analyse which could be difficult to navigate.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>Respondents showed a keenness to support the implementation of the FRMPs. However, funding was highlighted as a constraint, and it should be used effectively.</p>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>Most of those who answered agreed with the conclusions of the SEA.</p>

<p>Topics raised in the responses included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the need to ensure that FRMPs do not conflict or constrain the local nature recovery strategies actions to be developed by 2024</li>
  <li>more interventions are needed at a catchment-scale, where natural flood management or land use solutions would be beneficial</li>
  <li>the alignment between FRMPs and RBMPs was welcomed to maximise environmental opportunities and benefits. This could also prevent potential conflicting measures and projects being progressed and delivered at the same time</li>
</ul>

<p>The following points were made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to recognise the environmental benefits and ecosystem services of agricultural land. These include biodiversity, carbon sequestration and water quality. These benefits could be jeopardised if agricultural land is flooded</li>
  <li>there is limited base data and case studies to understand the costs and benefits of nature-based solutions and biodiversity net gain in relation to flood risk management</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 9: considering the likely impacts of climate change</h4>

<p>It was reported that the FRMPs were difficult to navigate. There was a suggestion to produce a summary list of the measure information and details for each geographical area. This will help readers understand where actions will be delivered.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>The consistency of the FRMP measures with those in the local flood risk management strategies was welcomed. The responses also showed eagerness to work with all organisations in the delivery of the measures.</p>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>There was a general agreement with the conclusions of the SEA.</p>

<p>Topics points raised included:</p>

<p>The recognition of the importance of agricultural land in the SEA was appreciated, although greater quantification of effects and consideration of the impact on food production is needed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>more detail should be included regarding the negative impacts of engineered solutions and the benefits of nature-based solutions</li>
  <li>the impact of using natural flood management and nature-based solutions on food production should be discussed further</li>
  <li>there should be more engagement with catchment partnerships and the food production industry</li>

<p>Some of the issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a greater emphasis on a catchment-based approach to manage the flow of water through the catchment better. All sources of water and their cumulative impact in flood risk should be understood</li>
  <li>although the FCERM strategy makes its long-term ambitions clear, there is a need to clarify how the implementation of the FRMP measures will support them</li>
  <li>the economic benefits that agriculture provides should be taken into consideration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question 8: delivering multiple benefits</h4>

<p>Some of the issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the plan does not address the impact of climate change on food production and the rural economy</li>
  <li>sewer flooding should be part of this section as it is a type of flood risk.</li>
  <li>there are inconsistencies over which scenarios are used across different programmes and strategies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions 10 to 11: using flood plan explorer</strong></p>

<p>There were mixed views for this question.</p>

<p>The feedback received shows that there was a lot of information in the FRMP. There was a suggestion to add a short section to clarify its contents and who the information is for.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>Respondents were willing to continue assisting by direct support of measures, promoting preparedness for flooding through community and personal flood plans, and strengthening local development planning policy.</p>

<p>Other issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importance of partnership working</li>
  <li>the need to co-ordinate the plans with investment programmes</li>
  <li>the important role of local organisations should be recognised, such as parish and town councils, as well as community-based flood groups and riparian owners</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>Most consultees who responded agreed totally or partially with the conclusions of the SEA. A considerable number of consultees did not respond and some of them did not know.</p>

<p>Respondents felt that there was a lot of information and that the core information should be summarised more clearly. Some found it difficult to understand the many plans and strategies referenced.</p>

<h4>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</h4>

<p>Some of the points raised by the consultees included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importance of engaging with schools and universities in the delivery of local flood risk management</li>
  <li>the fact that partnerships provide good value in the delivery of wider catchment scale measures</li>
  <li>the lack of resourcing will reduce the ability to support measures delivery</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>One third of the respondents didn't answer the question and those who answered didn't know or agreed partially with the SEA conclusions. The feedback received said that coastal flooding should be addressed more and that the SEAs should consider the impact of flooding on food production.</p>

<p>Some of the topics covered in the responses included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there were concerns about the recent increase in flooding events and impacts as well as the increase of proposed developments on the floodplain</li>
  <li>the need for communities to become more flood resilient</li>
  <li>working with nature and making space for water could help to address the effects of climate change</li>
  <li>the need for risk management authorities to work together in a joined-up way to resolve issues and address flood risk</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 10 to 11: using flood plan explorer</h4>

<p>Most consultees found using the flood plan explorer ok or easy, although thirteen of them found it not easy.</p>

<h4>Question 12: finding FRMP information</h4>

<p>A significant number of respondents did not answer this question. Most of those who did find what they were looking.</p>

<p>Issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there was a lot of information, and it was difficult to navigate at times</li>
  <li>there was a lack of detail on local issues</li>
  <li>there was a suggestion of adding an economic analysis and improvements to the flood plan explorer as the measures are implemented</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question 13: supporting the delivery of FRMPs</strong></p>

<p>Some of the points respondents made included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working with landowners and communities is very important as they have local knowledge to understand the potential impacts</li>
  <li>there is a need for baseline information on the different sources of flooding and detailed information on certain habitats and species</li>
  <li>an overall support of the goals, aspirations and delivery of the Thames FRMP through close partnerships working</li>
  <li>the issues raised included concerns over funding levels, the lack of focus on river erosion control, the impact of paving over gardens</li>
</ul>

<h4>Questions 14 to 16: Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA)</h4>

<p>The consultees who responded to the question had mixed views regarding the conclusions of the SEA. Some of the issues raised included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reservations on the methodology and the high volume of information</li>
  <li>there was a suggestion to produce a further summary of the non-technical summary and the need for further assessments closer to the implementation of the measure</li>
  <li>it was difficult to consider just flood risk without bearing in mind water abstractions. Drought and water should be considered as a whole</li>
  <li>other issues raised were the lack of references to estuarine and coastal habitat restoration, the benefits rivers can bring, impacts on flora, fauna, and funding</li>
</ul>
