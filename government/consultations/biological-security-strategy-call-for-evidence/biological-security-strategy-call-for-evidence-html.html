<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that effective preparation against biological threats requires a combination of effective risk assessment, planning, generic capabilities to respond to crises and prior experience of any given risk. Learning from COVID-19, we will improve our ability to anticipate and respond to biological threats through effective surveillance, improve our national preparedness and readiness across the whole risk lifecycle, and exploit opportunities presented by these risks<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The UK’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/biological-security-strategy">Biological Security Strategy</a> published in July 2018, brought together for the first time the work that takes place across government to protect the UK and our interests from significant biological risks, no matter how these occur and no matter who or what they affect. The 2018 strategy noted that while the likelihood of many of the worst-case biological risks is low, their potential impact is significant. Factors such as globalisation and rapid advances in technology will affect our risk picture.</p>

<h2>Background to this call for evidence</h2>

<p>Published in March 2021 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy</a> (the Integrated Review) set out the vision for the UK’s role in the world over the next decade. The Review set out the need to review and reinforce the cross-government approach to biological security, including a refresh of the 2018 strategy. As part of this work to refresh the strategy in 2022, the government will reevaluate the risk landscape and consider the evolving priorities since COVID-19 and in light of rapid advances in science and technology. The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the risk landscape and the UK’s response capabilities - in some instances capabilities have been improved (for example, mRNA vaccine technology) which have wider potential applications, and in others we must learn lessons from the current pandemic to build a more effective system for handling these complex biological risks.</p>

<p>This call for evidence has been launched to inform a refresh of the Biological Security Strategy review by providing a platform for external input and challenge on the strategy and its delivery. The UK government is consulting with a wide range of stakeholders across and beyond government to inform its development. Input from technical experts on this call for evidence is encouraged, including those with a background in biological engineering, biological security, contingency planning, and other related technical fields. Please limit your input to the questions set out below.</p>

<p>This call for evidence is distinct from the recently concluded <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/national-resilience-strategy-call-for-evidence">Resilience Strategy call for evidence</a>. The Resilience Strategy will set out a new vision and whole-of-society approach for the UK’s resilience, providing an overarching strategy for how resilience is maintained and developed across Government. The Biological Security Strategy provides a comprehensive view and system-wide approach to biological risks.</p>

<p>The refreshed Biological Security Strategy will not affect the COVID-19 public inquiry. Once the terms of reference for the public inquiry have been published in draft, Baroness Hallett, the Chair of the COVID-19 inquiry, will take forward a process of public engagement and consultation.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The 2018 strategy identifies several significant biological security risks relating to human health, animal and plant health, the environment, accidental release, and deliberate attack. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a major health crisis (such as pandemic influenza or new infectious disease);</li>
  <li>antimicrobial resistance;</li>
  <li>a deliberate biological attack by state or non-state actors (including terrorists);</li>
  <li>animal and plant diseases, which themselves can pose risks to human health; and</li>
  <li>accidental release and dual-use research of concern.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment%5C_data/file/952959/6.6920%5C_CO%5C_CCS%5C_s%5C_National%5C_Risk%5C_Register%5C_2020%5C_11-1-21-FINAL.pdf" rel="external">2020 National Risk Register (NRR)</a> identified <strong>a major human health crisis</strong> (such as pandemic influenza and non-influenza infectious outbreaks) as one of the most significant civil emergency risks facing the UK (a Level E risk).</p>

<p><strong>Antimicrobial Resistance</strong> is also included in the NRR. Lord O’Neill estimated, in his independent review on AMR, that if no action was taken, by 2050, AMR will account for an extra 10 million deaths a year globally.</p>

<p>The NRR assesses that a <strong>deliberate biological (or chemical) attack</strong> against the UK or its Armed Forces, and the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) technology to state and non-state actors, are aspects of this risk picture that may become more likely over the longer term. The UK’s counter terrorism strategy, CONTEST, also sets out the importance of preparing for the highest impact terrorist risks, including those using biological agents.</p>

<p>The impacts of <strong>major animal and plant diseases</strong> are also far-reaching and such outbreaks are likely to occur naturally as well as inadvertently (Foot and Mouth Disease 2007). Around 60% of all human diseases and 75% of all new and emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic diseases – that is, naturally transmitted from animals to people<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. <strong>Zoonoses are a major pathway</strong> by which an emerging pathogen could arise. Alongside the continuous management of diseases endemic to the UK there were 22 outbreaks of exotic notifiable animal diseases in the UK between August 2000 and December 2017. These individual outbreaks are estimated to have incurred costs to the government ranging from £300,000 to more than £3 billion. Plant and animal disease outbreaks can also have significant effects on the environment and on human health.</p>

<p><strong>Accidental release</strong> and <strong>dual-use research of concern</strong> pose considerable risks to the UK such as those experienced when smallpox and Foot and Mouth diseases escaped from insecure labs.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> The WHO assesses that dual-use research, where life science research is capable of being misapplied to do harm, has substantially increased in the past two decades,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> and that there are large gaps in international oversight mechanisms for dual-use research.</p>
