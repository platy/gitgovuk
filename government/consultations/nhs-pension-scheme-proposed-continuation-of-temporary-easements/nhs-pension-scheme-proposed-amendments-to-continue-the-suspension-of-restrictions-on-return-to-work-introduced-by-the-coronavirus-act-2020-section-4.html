<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A key component of the government’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been measures to boost the available <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce. Accordingly, section 45 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7" rel="external">Coronavirus Act 2020</a> suspends rules in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme to allow retired and partially retired staff to return to work or increase their working commitments without having their pension benefits suspended.</p>

<p>The emergence of the Omicron variant means that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> response to the coronavirus pandemic has lasted longer than was initially anticipated. The government has consistently kept under review the emergency measures that were introduced to help the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to deal with the pandemic.</p>

<p>The suspension of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme restrictions relating to retired staff returning to work will cease to have effect from 25 March 2022 when section 45 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 expires. However, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) has listened to concerns from the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and is of the view that the suspension of the restrictions on return to work should continue until 31 October 2022.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> considers that it is appropriate to continue the temporary amendments to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Schemes, made via section 45 of the Coronavirus Act, for a further period to ensure the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> can continue to benefit from the capacity boost provided by retired and partially retired staff when responding to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The consultation sets out proposals to continue the easement of the restrictions via temporary modifications to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme regulations. These changes would take effect from 25 March 2022 – to ensure a seamless transition from the expiry of section 45 – and run until 31 October 2022. Section 45 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 expires from 25 March 2022. It would be possible to extend section 45 by way of regulations (subject to the affirmative resolution procedure) made under section 90 of the Coronavirus Act.</p>

<p>However, the Coronavirus Act introduced a package of temporary measures to enable government to respond to the emergency situation and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> considers that it would be disproportionate to extend the act when there is alternative legislative means to suspend the restrictions to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme.</p>

<p>Therefore, the intention is to make these changes via amendments to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme legislation, subject to the usual parliamentary procedure and statutory consultation requirements in order to support the planned expiry of the Coronavirus Act in March 2022.</p>

<p>If required and where possible, government is seeking to extend the supportive powers in the Coronavirus Act via alternative legislation.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Returning to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> service after retirement</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme is designed to offer significant value in retirement to people who have chosen to dedicate part or all of their careers to serving the public through the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>. Backed by the Exchequer, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme offers the security of guaranteed income in every year of retirement for all its members, on some of the most generous terms available from a pension scheme, in recognition of their service to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and the country.</p>

<p>Eligible <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff will be active members of one of the 2 existing schemes. The final salary defined benefit scheme – or ‘legacy scheme’ – is made up of the 1995 and 2008 sections, and is now closed to new members. All new staff will join the 2015 scheme, a career average revalued earnings (<abbr title="career average revalued earnings">CARE</abbr>) scheme that provides benefits based on average earnings over a member’s career.</p>

<p>Returning to work for the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> after taking <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme benefits (known as ‘retire and return’) is an option available to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme members. The aims of retire and return are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to retain the skills and knowledge of experienced staff, which is necessary to deliver safe patient care</li>
  <li>help to support the health and wellbeing of older staff as they approach retirement and wish to continue working</li>
  <li>ensure that overall workforce costs are managed in line with budgets</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England and Improvement is working with the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Staff Council, a partnership of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trade unions and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Employers, to create a range of tools and support for organisations to embed flexible working. This includes toolkits aimed at line managers and individuals to support manging flexible working requests. New guidance for <abbr title="human resources">HR</abbr> managers is being developed on retire and return.</p>

<p>In addition, following a national collective agreement to include the right to flexible working from day one within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/publications/tchandbook" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Terms and Conditions of Service Handbook</a>, a programme is also underway to support organisations to understand the benefits for staff and patients of flexible working.</p>

<p>Building on the work carried out at the start of the pandemic to bring back former healthcare professionals, a new <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Reserve programme is being rolled out across England. Reservists are fully trained supplementary <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff who are committed to a number of days of service each year. Hospitals will be able to draw on the reserve programme to mobilise a broad range of staff, from doctors to IT experts, at times of high demand or for specific programmes like vaccination drives, ensuring the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> has additional capacity when it needs it most.</p>

<p>For most staff, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme does not place any limits on the amount that staff can work should they return after claiming their benefits. However, there are 3 rules across the schemes that limit the amount some retired staff can work in specific circumstances:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The 16-hour rule: this rule requires staff who retire and return from the 1995 section to work 16 hours a week (2 days) or less in the first month after retirement. Where staff work more than this limit, their pension benefits are temporarily suspended until their working commitments are reduced.</li>
  <li>Abatement of Special Class Status (<abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr>) members, including mental health officers who are eligible to retire from the 1995 section at age 55 instead of 60 without an actuarial reduction in their pension: abatement applies where staff return to work before age 60 and their pension plus salary exceeds their pre-retirement income.</li>
  <li>Abatement of 2008 section and 2015 scheme members who draw down a portion of their benefits and continue working: abatement requires them to reduce their pensionable pay by 10% upon each election to draw down benefits.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Coronavirus Act 2020</h3>

<p>Since 25 March 2020, these rules have been suspended by amendments to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Schemes made under section 45 of the Coronavirus Act 2020, one of the pieces of emergency legislation introduced to provide the government and the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> with the tools required to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. This provision of the Coronavirus Act is time limited and is due to expire at the end of 24 March 2022.</p>

<p>It was anticipated that the pandemic would place increased pressure on the healthcare system, so it was important that the Coronavirus Act contained provisions to boost <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce capacity. Section 45 of the Coronavirus Act suspends rules in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme to help retired and partially retired staff to return to work or increase their working commitments.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Act is set to expire at midnight on 24 March 2022, meaning from 25 March 2022 the suspended <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme rules will come back into force. In November 2021, notice was provided to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff and employers that the temporary easements were due to expire. This notice period was intended to give staff and employers time to adjust to a return to business as usual arrangements. In response, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> employers and trade union representatives have expressed concerns that the easements are still required to allow staff to contribute additional capacity during the ongoing pandemic response.</p>

<h3>Abatement in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme</h3>

<p>The normal pension age (<abbr title="normal pension age">NPA</abbr>) for members of the 1995 section is 60, However, some members are eligible to retire earlier if they hold <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr>. <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> is a preserved right awarded to certain professions in the 1995 section, which, subject to qualifying criteria being met, allows a member to retire at 55 instead of 60 without an actuarial reduction in benefits that would normally apply when claiming benefits early. It was withdrawn for new entrants from 6 March 1995 as part of the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme restructuring at that time.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr>, a member must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been in pensionable employment as a nurse, physiotherapist, midwife or health visitor on or before 6 March 1995</li>
  <li>not had a break in pensionable employment of 5 years or more</li>
  <li>have spent the last 5 years of their pensionable employment prior to retirement as a nurse, physiotherapist, midwife or health visitor</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> allows members to retire at 55 instead of 60 without the actuarial reduction to their pension that would apply to other members who claim their benefits early. However, under normal arrangements, <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members who return to work between age 55 to 60 are subject to abatement. This means their pension plus salary cannot exceed their pre-retirement income, and their pension is reduced if it does.</p>

<p>Abatement ceases to apply at age 60. For members with long careers, the abatement ceiling typically prevents them from working more than half-time in the week should they return to work before age 60. However, where abatement applies, even staff with long careers can perform substantial amounts of work.</p>

<p>The abatement ceiling limits the amount that returning <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members can work between 55 and 60 when in receipt of pension benefits. There have been concerns from stakeholders that the eventual reintroduction of abatement would force returning <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members to retire. This is not the case, as it is still possible for <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members to perform significant amounts of work without exceeding their abatement ceiling, even for members with long careers.</p>

<p>The below graph sets out the proportion of <abbr title="full-time equivalent">FTE</abbr> that the 3 example <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members could work after claiming their benefits without exceeding their respective abatement ceilings.</p>

<h4>Figure 2: abatement ceilings for 3 example <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> nurses as a proportion of <abbr title="full-time equivalent">FTE</abbr>
</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Graph showing average pension size for 3 SCS nurses with 25, 30, 35 years of membership at retirement. They will accrue annual pensions of £12,000, £14,400 and £16,800 at age 55 and can work at least half-time before abatement applies." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/142074/Figure-2.PNG"></div></figure>

<p>Source: Government Actuary’s Department</p>

<p>The above graph shows the average pension size for 3 example <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> nurses with 25, 30 and 35 years of pension membership at retirement. These members will, on average, accrue annual pensions of £12,000, £14,400 and £16,800 respectively, payable at age 55. The graph also shows the percentage of <abbr title="full-time equivalent">FTE</abbr> that each example member could work if they returned to work after retirement while in receipt of pension benefits. All members can work at least half-time when in receipt of benefits before abatement applies.</p>

<p>In the interests of fairness to all scheme members, it is right that abatement applies to <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members under normal circumstances. Members who qualify for <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> are a closed cohort who are eligible for a valuable benefit that has not been available to new staff since 6 March 1995, even for those in the same professions. <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> allows members to retire 5 years earlier than the <abbr title="normal pension age">NPA</abbr>, without an actuarial reduction. <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members do not pay additional contributions for this benefit.</p>

<p>Therefore, abatement limits the ability of <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members to retire early on an unreduced pension and return to work on a full salary. This ensures fairness to all scheme members and protects the public purse from the impact of staff continuing to work full time while in receipt of generous pension benefits.</p>

<p>However, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce. At the outset of the pandemic, it was anticipated that measures would be required to boost the available <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce. A key component of the pandemic response has been to encourage retired and partially retired staff to return to work or increase their working commitments. Section 45 of the Coronavirus Act suspends rules in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme to allow retired staff to perform additional work without having the payment of their pension benefits reduced or suspended.</p>

<p>The government is grateful for the contributions of retired and partially retired staff during the pandemic response period. The additional capacity they have provided has been vital in tackling the pandemic and assisting the vaccine roll-out. The Coronavirus Act is a 2-year time-limited piece of legislation that is set to expire from 25 March 2022. However, the emergence of the Omicron variant means the pandemic response is likely to go on beyond this point. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the emergency provisions should be extended for a further period.</p>

<h2>Proposed amendments to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme regulations</h2>

<h3>Proposed amendments to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme regulations to continue the suspension of restrictions on return to work introduced by section 45 of the Coronavirus Act</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has kept the impact of the temporary easement of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme restrictions relating to retired staff returning to work under review, and considers it proportionate to the ongoing pandemic response to continue the easements currently provided by section 45 of the Coronavirus Act for a further period until 31 October 2022.</p>

<p>An extension recognises the emergence of the Omicron variant, which means the pandemic response period is expected to last longer than anticipated. It is therefore proportionate to extend the measures aimed to support the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce during this period.</p>

<p>We are proposing amendments to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme regulations that take effect from 25 March 2022 to ensure continued suspension of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme rules following the expiry of section 45 on 24 March 2022.</p>

<p>The amendments to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme regulations would replicate the temporary suspension of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the 16-hour rule in the 1995 section</li>
  <li>abatement of <abbr title="Special Class Status">SCS</abbr> members who retire and return to work between age 55 to 60 in the 1995 section</li>
  <li>abatement of draw-down members who claim a portion of their benefits and continue working in the 2008 section and 2015 scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>A suspension until 31 October 2022 ensures that the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> workforce continues to benefit from increased capacity from retired and partially retired staff during the ongoing COVID-19 response. However, a temporary suspension also ensures the easements remain linked to the pandemic response period only and expire at the correct time once the need for emergency provisions has ended.</p>

<p>The further continuation of the easements allows the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> sufficient time to deal with the Omicron variant. In fairness to all scheme members and the public purse, it is right that abatement applies under normal circumstances to restrict the benefits provided to a closed cohort of staff.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> recognises that work/life balance and flexibility around retirement options are key concerns for older staff. <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England and Improvement have launched an initiative focused on employers making flexible employment offers to late career staff. While <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> keeps the ways in which pension scheme design can support this under review, a major element of the campaign is leveraging the scheme to support retention by promoting to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff the value of continuing to build up their pension</li>
  <li>employers the value of using existing flexibility around working patterns and retirement</li>
</ul>

<p>These include options for partial retirement and pensionable re-employment in the 2008 section and 2015 scheme</p>

<h2>Public sector equality duty</h2>

<p>The proposed amendments to <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Pension Scheme regulations seek to continue the easements currently provided by section 45 of the Coronavirus Act 2020. Therefore, the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s equality analysis remains consistent with the initial analysis performed at the introduction of the Coronavirus Act.</p>
