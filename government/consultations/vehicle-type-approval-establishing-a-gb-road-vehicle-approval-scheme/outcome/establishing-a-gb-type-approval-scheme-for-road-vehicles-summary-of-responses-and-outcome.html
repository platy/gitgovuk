<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Executive summary</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Introduction</h3>

<p>The vehicle type approval consultation was launched to seek views on proposals to create a vehicle type-approval scheme for Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>).</p>

<p>This scheme is intended to be a permanent replacement to the existing&nbsp;provisional scheme that came into force after 31 December 2020, at the end of the transitional period following our departure from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>This consultation ran between 1 June 2022 and 29 June 2022. The consultation focused on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating a full type-approval system for passenger and goods vehicles, their components and trailers, to be sold in Great Britain, and the transitional steps that are being put in place to assist manufacturers before the system fully applies</li>
  <li>extending the period for applications to the existing provisional scheme for passenger and goods vehicles to ensure manufacturers can continue to approve their products before the full scheme is fully implemented</li>
  <li>making provisional approval schemes compulsory for replacement components (for all product categories) and trailers from 1 January 2023, to assist the transition to the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme</li>
  <li>implementing provisional approval scheme for engines for non-road mobile machinery (<abbr title="non-road mobile machinery">NRMM</abbr>)</li>
  <li>creating a full type-approval scheme for passenger and goods vehicles and their components and trailers, that are intended for Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Key findings and next steps in each area</h3>

<p>Key findings and next steps in each area are summarised here and presented in more detail in the relevant sections of this Summary of Responses document.</p>

<h4>Statutory plates</h4>

<p>Most respondents who commented on the statutory plate options preferred Option 1, adding the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval number to the additional information section of the plate, over Option 2, having an additional plate. There was a broad agreement that a transition period for the change to the manufacturer’s statutory plates is needed. Some respondents said the transition period timings were appropriate, however, most said that more time is required to implement the changes.</p>

<h4>Transition dates for the acceptance of technical reports from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical services</h4>

<p>Of those who commented on this section, there was broad agreement that the Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) should accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical reports. Some respondents proposed that <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> should accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical reports beyond 2025. There was considerable concern about potential delays to approvals due to <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>’s high volume of work and the lack of homologation/type approval skills in the importers.</p>

<h4>Multi-stage build vehicles</h4>

<p>Of those who commented, there was broad agreement that there should be a temporary waiver for converters to obtain <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type approval when the base (incomplete or complete) vehicle has <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval. Several commenters asked for a longer period for this to be allowed, and one wanted it to be a permanent feature of the scheme.</p>

<h4>Provisional and full approval of components and separate technical units</h4>

<p>Respondents supported the proposals for provisional and full type approval for components and separate technical units. Although, some wanted more time for manufacturers of components fitted on the production line to comply with the changes. A number of implications of the changes for manufacturers were highlighted by respondents in this section which we will consider moving forwards with this policy.</p>

<h4>Provisional and full approval of trailers</h4>

<p>The majority of respondents were supportive of our proposals on the provisional and full type approval for trailers, although some wanted a delay. The importance of engagement with stakeholders and striking a balance with the timescales was flagged by respondents in this section.</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>

<p>Given the broad consensus that businesses need more time to prepare, we propose to change the date from when the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme will apply to new types of passenger and goods vehicles to 1 February 2024 and 1 February 2025 for trailers. We will extend the provisional approval schemes to allow vehicles to continue to be brought to market. Approvals issued to the provisional scheme will continue to be valid for up to 2 years.</p>

<p>We have noted concerns that once the full scheme becomes compulsory, there is a risk that existing types with valid provisional approvals could be caught by the full scheme earlier than expected if changes are made that are considered to create a new vehicle type by <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>. We will continue to work with both <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> and manufacturers to agree the approach in these circumstances.</p>

<p>The waiver for statutory plates will continue to be aligned with the date the scheme becomes compulsory for new types (the dates given in the paragraph above).</p>

<p>We propose to extend the period of acceptance of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> certificates of conformity (CoC) until July 2026, to give manufacturers sufficient time to prepare. This will also create the option of moving directly to electronic CoC’s.</p>

<p>We proposed a relaxation to enable converters engaged in multi-stage build to obtain <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type approval where the base vehicle only has <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval. The end of this concession is extended by seven months in line with the new timings of the compulsory introduction of the scheme. The responses indicate that there is a need for the proposed temporary acceptance of test reports issued by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical services. We will extend the technical services derogation period by one year to 31 December 2026 for M and N and 31 December 2027 for O categories. This extension will give ample time for <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to appoint additional technical services (including those based in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) before this derogation ends.</p>

<p>We are planning for <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to be able to accept applications for designation from other (both domestic and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-based) technical services, but they will remain the sole approval authority.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we also have decided that the provisional schemes for L and T category vehicles and engines for non-road mobile machinery will continue until to accept applications for approval until the 31 December 2027 to provide more time to bring the full schemes for these categories into place. This is based on feedback we received in this consultation and through other engagement with stakeholders.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>We want the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to be a pioneer in promoting safe, secure, environmentally friendly and technologically advanced vehicles.</p>

<p>The government is responsible for setting the safety and environmental standards for new vehicles, their parts and equipment, and ensuring they are of a high standard.</p>

<p>Before placing their products on the market, manufacturers must demonstrate that they comply with these standards through a process known as type-approval which is overseen by the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>From the 1 January 2021 an interim provisional type-approval scheme came into effect in Great Britain to permit the ongoing sale and registration of new motor vehicles.</p>

<p>Our priority now is to establish a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval system which allows the safe introduction of the latest technologies such as automated driving systems and ensures vehicle emissions continue to meet the highest standards.</p>

<p>The first step is to introduce a full scheme for road vehicles and the consultation focused on the measures being taken to create the type-approval scheme for passenger and goods vehicles, their trailers and components.</p>

<p>It also set out plans to introduce a provisional type-approval scheme for engines for <abbr title="non-road mobile machinery">NRMM</abbr> (ranging from farming and construction machinery to rail locomotives and inland waterway vessels) that at present can continue to be placed on the market in Great Britain with a valid <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval.</p>

<p>This will provide an interim step for these products before the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval system fully applies to them in the future.</p>

<p>We have not set out plans for the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval schemes to replace the interim ones for two and three wheeled motorcycles and quadricycles, agricultural tractors, and engines for <abbr title="non-road mobile machinery">NRMM</abbr>. These will be made available in due course.</p>

<p>We also set out how the proposed legislation will implement our obligations under the Northern Ireland Protocol by clarifying that <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> can issue approvals to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations, known as United Kingdom Northern Ireland (UKNI) approvals.</p>

<p>These UKNI approvals will be required for products without <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval being placed on the market in Northern Ireland and, will be valid across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>This document summarises the points raised by respondents to the consultation, we will continue to gather evidence, engage with stakeholders and further develop policy noting that at the present time we do not have the legal powers to implement some of the changes requested by consultees, but we will have in the future.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span> Statutory plates</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>Manufacturers will be required to affix a statutory plate to each vehicle showing the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval number, main characteristics and weights.</p>

<p>The general provisions for the format and content of the statutory plate will be as set out in Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 19/2011, as retained in domestic law.</p>

<p>To support manufacturers who use plates to satisfy requirements in other markets, we made two options available for consideration in the consultation.</p>

<p>For Option 1, we proposed accepting the addition of the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval number in the space that is reserved for ‘additional information’ on an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> plate.</p>

<p>For Option 2, we proposed accepting a second plate containing information limited to the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval number, the vehicle identification number and the manufacturers name. We would expect this additional label to be placed alongside an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> statutory plate.</p>

<p>To further assist manufacturers in transitioning to the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval scheme, we suggested waiving the requirements to fit a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> statutory plate for vehicles with full approval manufactured before the compulsory ‘new types’ date of the new scheme (1 July 2023), where they are fitted with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> manufacturer’s statutory plate and supplied with an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Certificate of Conformity.</p>

<p>Vehicles manufactured on or after 1 July 2023 would need to conform fully and fit a plate.</p>

<p>The first section of the consultation sought views on our proposed options for the alternative statutory plates and to allow a transition period for manufacturer’s statutory plates. The responses we received and next steps are summarised below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Comments</h3>

<p>Of the respondents that commented on the statutory plate options, 77% preferred Option 1 over Option 2. Separately, 7 respondents said that both should be offered to cater for manufacturers and importers in different situations.</p>

<p>The following reasons for supporting Option 1 were given:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a dedicated <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> plate could hamper free movement of second-hand machines between <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>option 1 is the best option for manufacturers who export their goods</li>
  <li>option 1 avoids duplication and additional parts which best serves manufacturing efficiency</li>
  <li>better for the leisure industry to have all the information on a plate that is accepted by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</li>
  <li>concern around the tampering risks about an additional plate</li>
</ul>

<p>One respondent, who supported Option 2, felt it would be easier for the approval authority to assess.</p>

<p>22 respondents commented on the proposed transition period. 77% were supportive of having a transition period. However, the remaining respondents thought the period was too short for manufacturers to fully prepare for and deliver this change.</p>

<p>Concerns were also raised about the capacity of the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to deal with the uptick in workload. There was concern about recruitment for both <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> and the industry and the lack of homologation/type approval skills in the importers.</p>

<p>One organisation suggested that the transition period should go beyond the mandatory start date to de-risk the implementation.</p>

<p>One respondent noted that the proposed timings are acceptable for most of their members but may be difficult for those who work as assembly plants and stage 1 vehicle manufacturers.</p>

<p>Some respondents noted that any option would have associated costs for business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Next steps</h3>

<p>We will proceed with the proposed approach to permit both statutory plate options, to mitigate the risks highlighted above and allow for flexibility.</p>

<p>This is in addition to the standard <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> statutory plate format. For Option 2, the additional plate will have to meet the same anti-tampering measures as the main plate therefore not increasing the tampering risk beyond that which exists already.</p>

<p>As proposed, we will continue to align the date when a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> statutory plate is required with the date the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme becomes compulsory for new vehicle types. Manufacturers may however choose to apply a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> statutory plate earlier if they wish.</p>

<p>These easements and options have been put in place to ease burdens on manufacturers as much as possible.</p>

<p>We recognise concerns from some respondents that <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will have a high uptick in their workload. We have therefore outlined our next steps in response to these concerns in the conclusion.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Proposed transition dates for the acceptance of technical reports issued by a technical service designated by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> authority</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>Technical services are bodies designated by the approval authority to carry out activities such as tests and inspections. Only technical services designated by the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will be able to carry out these activities for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> will also continue to operate as a technical service for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>In the consultation, we suggested that, for a short transition period, we will permit the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to issue <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approvals on the basis of test reports from technical services designated by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval authorities which, in the case of many existing vehicle types, could have been produced before the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s exit from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>We suggested permitting this approach until 31 December 2025 in the case of <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> system type-approvals applying to passenger and goods vehicles (categories M and N).</p>

<p>For system approvals, trailers towed by road vehicles (category O), components and separate technical units, the final date on which the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> would be able to accept test reports prepared by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical services would be 31 December 2026.</p>

<p>After this period, we proposed that, only test reports from technical services designated by the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval scheme would be accepted.</p>

<p>We sought views on the proposed transition dates for the acceptance of technical reports issued by a technical service designated by an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Comments</h3>

<p>37% of respondents to this section felt that <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> should accept reports from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical services. The remaining responses didn’t comment on this but focused on other issues such as the perceived lack of technical services, concerns about <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> capacity and extending the proposed dates beyond 2025.</p>

<p>Some respondents requested more time, the following concerns were highlighted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current timeline is likely to be insufficient given that the only alternative to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical services is <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>’s own technical service and there will be a significant testing burden</li>
  <li>lack of technical services could lead to delay in approvals</li>
  <li>multiple services would provide a more robust system</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of respondents felt the proposal and dates are appropriate. One of these respondents highlighted the importance of avoiding onerous processes and that technical reports continue to be accepted for a reasonable period of time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Next steps</h3>

<p>The responses indicate that there is a need for the proposed temporary acceptance of test reports issued by <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> technical services. We will extend the technical services derogation period by one year for M and N to 31 December 2026 and to 31 December 2027 for O categories. This additional time will ensure that manufacturers have migrated their approvals across to the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> full scheme for the relevant vehicle categories by the proposed new dates and this extension in time will facilitate a smooth transition.</p>

<p>We are planning for <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to be able to accept applications for designation from other (both domestic and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-based) technical services, but they will remain the sole approval authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Multi-stage approvals</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>The multi-stage build process involves different manufacturers in the production of a vehicle, each approving their stage before passing it on to the next manufacturer. This process will be retained in the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme.</p>

<p>To assist manufacturers and converters of such vehicles, we proposed having a transition period (until 31 December 2025, or in the case of category O trailers, 31 December 2026) for the second stage manufacturers to apply for a full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval where the previous stage only holds an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Comments</h3>

<p>Of the responses to this section, 86% supported the proposed approach, with some requesting a longer period for acceptance of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> base vehicles (one respondent specified an extension to 36 months after the compulsory new types date and one asked for this to be permanent).</p>

<p>The remaining respondents didn’t support the proposals or the scheme going ahead at all.</p>

<p>One respondent noted that the current production limits for the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> national small series scheme cannot be amended at this time, but requested that this situation is discussed further once legal powers are put in place to implement amendments to legislation in order to assist industry in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>Another respondent noted that European incomplete vehicle imports to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> form a small proportion of the overall manufacturing volume for a manufacturer. They were concerned that additional administrative burden may lead a manufacturer to determine it is not worthwhile and products will cease to be offered for import.</p>

<p>They proposed a change to make allowance in the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme for permanent acceptance of an incomplete European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<abbr title="European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval">ECWVTA</abbr>) certification, provided that a Letter of Agreement exists between the stages of manufacture, and that a <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> representative for the incomplete manufacturer is listed in the overall <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> Approval certificate.</p>

<p>One respondent mentioned conversion of petrol and diesel-engine vehicles into electric power. There are procedures already in place for this via the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> INF26 guidance on their points- based scheme, meaning that some conversions will need an <abbr title="Individual Vehicle Approval">IVA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Next steps</h3>

<p>Our consultation proposed to allow an 30 month transition period from the date the compulsory scheme applies to give multi stage manufacturers time to adapt.</p>

<p>We will maintain that period noting that the compulsory application will now begin on 1 February 2024 which means transition period for this temporary waiver will cease on 1 August 2026 for M and N category and August 2027 for O category.</p>

<p>We note the request to continue to accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approvals for the base vehicles however, this is not in line with government policy to cease acceptance of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approvals. We will continue to work with manufacturers to ensure they and their suppliers are prepared for the changes.</p>

<p>We have noted the comment regarding numerical limits for small series. We are not able to make changes to the numerical limits as part of this exercise but welcome views on how the scheme may be developed in the future.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Provisional and full type-approval for components and separate technical units</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>Some components and separate technical units are intended solely for sale on the aftermarket as replacement parts. Many of these may be intended for vehicles that are no longer in production or that were first registered based on <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approvals that are no longer valid for new registrations.</p>

<p>We believe the process of obtaining a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval in these cases could be unnecessarily burdensome.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the consultation, we proposed permitting such components to continue to be sold on the aftermarket without the need to subsequently obtain a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval, provided their <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> type-approval was granted before 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>We also proposed that, manufacturers of replacement components and separate technical units who obtained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-type approval on or after 1 January 2023 would, for an interim period, have the option of applying for a provisional <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval. This means the scheme will allow the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to issue provisional <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approvals to manufacturers holding valid <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approvals without further checks. These approvals will be valid for two years, giving holders additional time to obtain full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval.</p>

<p>The consultation outlined that provisional approvals would only be available for 18 months. From 1 July 2024 new types of components and separate technical units for sale in the aftermarket would require full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval. Full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type approval will also be required when existing provisional approvals cease to be valid (on their second anniversary) or where a component has never been <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> type approved.</p>

<p>We sought views on the proposed approach to provisional and full type-approval for components and separate technical units.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Comments</h3>

<p>There was a mixed response to the proposed approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>62.5% of respondents said they supported provisional type-approval for components and separate technical units</li>
  <li>12.5% did not support the proposal</li>
  <li>25% were unsure and had some concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding full type-approval, only 3 respondents commented on the proposals, 2 in support and 1 against.</p>

<p>Of these responses, one respondent challenged the proposal and suggested that it is more logical to take a phased approach and start with components and separate technical units first, systems, trailers and then motorised road vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One organisation was supportive but requested that, in order to ensure a smooth transition into the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> full scheme, there should either be a delay between the component and vehicle mandatory approval dates or a provisional scheme should be implemented for all components and separate technical units which remains acceptable for a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> full whole vehicle type-approval for a transitional period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining comments related to the risks of the proposals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is an issue of proportionality between parts that are covered by ‘whole vehicle type approval’ and individual replacement parts being type approved by independent operators. Without a defined test procedure for these replacement parts that is both practical and proportionate, the ability to offer competing replacement parts to those being offered by the vehicle manufacturer will be severely compromised</li>
  <li>the requirements for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-certified components to be re-certified under the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme remains unclear</li>
  <li>the changes may drive component manufacturers to withdraw from the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> market rather than take on the additional burden. This could have a significant impact on niche and small volume manufacturers that are forced to redesign their products to fit alternative <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>-approved components, or in the worst case scenario to fund and manage approval of their own version of those components because no existing manufacture of such a component is willing to participate in the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme for low volume sales</li>
  <li>it is important to make the process simple for other countries to follow, failure to do so could see a lot of non-approved components coming onto the market in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One respondent noted that it would be helpful if <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> authority component approvals obtained before the system approval and the Whole Vehicle Type Approval (<abbr title="Whole Vehicle Type Approval">WVTA</abbr>) were to be accepted. Retesting for emissions would have a considerable impact on business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Next steps</h3>

<p>It is important to note that the majority of components are unaffected by these proposals. Most components that require type approval are approved to internationally recognised <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe">UNECE</abbr> regulations which will continue to be accepted in Great Britain without further approval. We therefore plan to proceed with the proposals as set out in the consultation document but, in line with the other easements, replacement components intended for sale in the aftermarket will need full approval from 1 February 2025 (7-month later compared to the consultation proposal) or when the provisional approval runs out, if later. The provisional dates will apply from 1 January 2023, as proposed in the consultation, for replacement components that obtained <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approval on or after 1 January 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Provisional and full type-approval for trailers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Background</h3>

<p>A provisional <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme is also being made available for trailers for an interim period as an alternative to full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval.</p>

<p>Our consultation outlined that the provisional scheme for trailers will apply to all trailers placed on the market from 1 January 2023, other than trailers that were already in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on that date.</p>

<p>From this date, placing trailers on the market without provisional or full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval will not be permitted, except in the special cases of trailers with <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>(<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) approvals or trailers that are qualifying goods from Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>From 1 July 2024, full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approvals would be required for new types and for existing types with provisional approvals that are more than 2 years old.</p>

<p>We sought views on the proposed approach to provisional and full type-approval for trailers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Comments</h3>

<p>86% of respondents who commented on our proposed approach to provisional and full type-approval for trailers were supportive.</p>

<p>One respondent expressed that the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme should not introduce new requirements for vehicles or trailers without widespread consultation with <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> based manufacturers.</p>

<p>Another respondent flagged concerns around making trailers compulsory with effect from 1 January 2023 given <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> pressures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Next steps</h3>

<p>We intend to proceed with the proposed plans to require provisional approvals for trailers from the 1 January 2023, ending acceptance of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> approvals for these categories. However, as noted in section 1.2, we will provide manufacturers with more time to prepare for the introduction of the full approval scheme by moving the date it becomes compulsory for new types by 7 months, to 1 February 2025.</p>

<p>We have added 13 months to avoid the date falling in peak holiday season for the automotive industry and <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>For our response to the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> capacity concerns, please see the conclusion section.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Other comments</h2>

<p>Other points raised by respondents that fell outside the scope of the questions have been noted and are summarised below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it was claimed that a lead time of 24 months (or at minimum 12) before the mandatory application date will give businesses time to sufficiently prepare</li>
  <li>any type which has had a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> provisional type approval should never be treated as a New Type for technical requirements when it becomes a New Type purely as a result of its move to the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> comprehensive type-approval</li>
  <li>using a phased introduction to make the move to the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval scheme, for example, road vehicles and then trailers on different timescales</li>
  <li>avoid unnecessary divergence from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>avoid unnecessary duplication – duplication of certification and conformity of production procedures will lead to additional costs to business</li>
  <li>effective communication will be key to ensuring a smooth transition</li>
  <li>a new framework should take advantage of new elements rather than just correcting deficiencies</li>
  <li>comments in relation to category T, category L and <abbr title="non-road mobile machinery">NRMM</abbr> were noted and will inform the development of the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type-approval schemes for those categories</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Conclusion</h2>

<p>Alongside publication of this response, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> intends to proceed to make and lay a  statutory instrument, The Road Vehicles and Non-Road Mobile Machinery (Type-Approval) (Amendment and Transitional Provisionals) (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit) Regulations 2022. This legislation will incorporate the changes outlined, following feedback on this consultation.</p>

<p>We have carefully considered the request for a longer lead time before the compulsory application of the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme. We have therefore decided to provide 13 months between the introduction of the scheme on the 1 January 2023 and its mandatory application for passenger and goods vehicles. This means new vehicles types will require full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> type approval from 1 February 2024 and 1 February 2025 for trailers.</p>

<p>We had proposed to allow manufacturers to continue providing paper <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Certificates of Conformity with new vehicles that were approved to the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme and manufactured before 1 July 2023. We recognise that moving to a <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> certificate is likely to be more costly than originally expected due to the time needed to update computer systems to accommodate the required format. We are therefore proposing to allow the continued use of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> paper certificates of conformity until July 2026. This coincides with the proposed introduction of electronic certificates of conformity, permitting manufacturers to move directly to this approach rather than produce paper <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> certificates if they prefer.</p>

<p>We understand concerns regarding treating vehicles approved under the provisional scheme as new types when they move to the full scheme. In the case of Emergency Call (<abbr title="Emergency Call">eCall</abbr>) and the heavy metals ban which is checked during Recyclability type approval, existing approvals will not be treated as new types, thus maintaining exemptions that are applicable currently. We will work with <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> and manufacturers to develop a suitable approach for this situation if it arises with other subjects. Despite the 7-month delay to the application of the new scheme, we would strongly encourage manufacturers to apply for <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval as early as possible, even if this is only for one model, in order to gain experience during the period when an approval is not required.</p>

<p>The technical requirements that will apply in the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> scheme will be those that applied in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> on the day of Brexit. These proposals do not specifically address divergence with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but instead create the powers needed to ensure the Government will be able to set the technical requirements tailored to the needs of Great Britain in the future. Any significant changes would require a further consultation with stakeholders. Vehicles meeting the latest, generally more stringent <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements that are not referred to in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> legislation, will be accepted for <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> approval, unless such vehicles would not meet the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> requirements, and to date we have no evidence of this occurring.</p>

<p>We believe the proposals avoid duplication of approval work by manufacturers wherever practical, but the creation of a national approval scheme will inevitably require some <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> specific approval activities. We are open to working further with industry and the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to see if there are additional steps that can be taken minimise burdens.</p>

<p>We have made provision to allow the provisional schemes for L and T category and engines for non-road mobile machinery to continue until the 31 December 2027. This will provide further time to bring forward the legislation needed to create the full <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> schemes for these categories and we may consult further on these full schemes and their mandatory application dates in the future.</p>

<p>We have noted the specific concerns raised with regard to engines for use in non-road mobile machinery where they are intended for export, use by armed forces or for field testing. Our intention is not to prevent the placing on the market in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> of such engines and we will provide further guidance on this for manufacturers.</p>

<p>Other issues raised outside the scope of the consultation will be considered for potential inclusion in future legislation and we will explore non-legislative options for priority issues in collaboration with stakeholders. The changes being proposed here are without prejudice to any further comments that may be received through the ongoing World Trade Organization (<abbr title="World Trade Organization">WTO</abbr>) notification procedure.</p>
