<p>The Liberty Protection Safeguards National Minimum Data Set (<abbr title="Liberty Protection Safeguards: National Minimum Data Set">LPS NMDS</abbr>) is a list of the data items and corresponding questions that Responsible Bodies will be required to collect, on a regular basis, under the new LPS system. The data set has been developed by considering the requirements for national monitoring and reporting by the monitoring bodies and government which will be set out in regulations.</p>

<p>The data set has been developed to be as streamlined as possible, so as to reduce burden on local authorities and NHS bodies.</p>

<p>The recommended data set covers operational aspects of the LPS process (such as how many, how long, decisions made), demographics and equalities, and outcomes for the person who has been deprived of their liberty. Further guidance will be produced for Responsible Bodies who will be required to input the data, ahead of LPS implementation.</p>

<p>These tables set out the following aspects of the <abbr title="Liberty Protection Safeguards: National Minimum Data Set">LPS NMDS</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>national questions: there are 19 questions in total. Each question has a number of corresponding data items that Responsible Bodies will have to collect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national data items: there are currently 30 data items proposed. Each data item is accompanied by a description of what the Responsible Body will have to collect. For some data items, Responsible Bodies will only be able to choose from a drop-down list of options (referred to as ‘look-up tables’)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
