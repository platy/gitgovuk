<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) is conducting a post-implementation review of 3 sets of regulations made in exercise of powers under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 to determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether all 3 regulations meet their original objectives</li>
  <li>whether their scope is still appropriate and proportionate</li>
  <li>their impact on providers</li>
  <li>whether any changes are required to achieve those objectives with a system that imposes less regulation or to change what the regulations prescribe</li>
</ul>

<p>These regulations are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009</li>
  <li>Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</li>
  <li>Care Quality Commission (Reviews and Performance Assessments) Regulations 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of this review, we are seeking feedback from all providers of a regulated activity that are registered with the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) in England, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS bodies</li>
  <li>adult social care providers</li>
  <li>independent providers, including independent contractors providing NHS services</li>
  <li>voluntary sector organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit feedback <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consultations.dhsc.gov.uk/6290d80bd2ebf03a5c27dfac" rel="external">please complete the online survey</a> by 22 July 2022.</p>

<p>We are asking individual locations registered with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to submit a response. Please coordinate with relevant team members within your organisation, including the individual who acts as your registered manager (where this role exists) with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>, and finance lead to submit one response per registration.</p>

<p>All feedback received will be summarised and published in a post-implementation review report. The published report will have full regard for the anonymity of all respondents.</p>

<p>Note, all questions are optional. Please answer as many questions as you can to the best of your knowledge, providing estimates where necessary.</p>

<h2>Section 1: Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3112/contents/made" rel="external">Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009</a> (‘the 2009 Regulations’) requires all providers of regulated activities to register with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. Regulated activities are defined in section 8 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and the list of regulated activities is specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111117613/schedule/1" rel="external">Schedule 1 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The policy objective of the 2009 Regulations was to achieve the integration and alignment of health and adult social care regulation across all types of providers – whether public, private or third sector. This is to ensure, for example, that the NHS, private and voluntary healthcare sectors are subject to common regulatory procedures and standards. The 2009 Regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to set and maintain registration requirements</li>
  <li>enable the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to directly collect information from providers about the services they provide</li>
  <li>ensure providers of regulated activities meet these registration requirements to become and remain registered with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>set out provisions in relation to compliance with the regulations and offences</li>
  <li>contain provisions for providers to notify the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> of certain incidents</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">

<p>Do you agree or disagree that the 2009 Regulations meet their original objectives?</p>

<h2>Section 2: Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</h2>

<p>The Health and Social Care Act 2008 requires all providers who carry out ‘regulated activities’ in England to register with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> and to comply with the requirements set out in regulations made under that act.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111117613/contents" rel="external">The Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</a> (‘the 2014 Regulations’) are made in exercise of powers under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. The 2014 Regulations set out the regulated activities in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111117613/schedule/1" rel="external">Schedule 1</a> and the fundamental standards that all registered providers must comply with.</p>

<h3>Overarching objectives</h3>

<p>The 2014 Regulations prescribe the activities that providers should register with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> and set fundamental standards, below which care should not fall. We would like your feedback to understand whether the 2014 Regulations meet their objectives in ensuring that they require all health and/or adult social care providers that present a risk to the safety of patients or service users to be registered and help to maintain fundamental standards.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question</p>

<p>To the best of your knowledge, are the 2014 Regulations proportionate by regulating only activities, services and providers where there is a risk to the safety of patients and/or service users?</p>

  <li>no (please explain)</li>
  <li>don’t know</li>

<h3>The fundamental standards</h3>

<p>The 2014 Regulations set out the statutory minimum standards, below which care must never fall. We would like your feedback on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111117613/part/3/crossheading/fundamental-standards" rel="external">Fundamental Standards.</a></p>

<p>They cover person-centred care, dignity and respect, consent, safe care and treatment, safeguarding from abuse and improper treatment, meeting nutritional and hydration needs, premises and equipment, receiving and acting on complaints, good governance, staffing, fit and proper persons, duty of candour, and display of performance assessments.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question</p>

<h3>Duty of candour</h3>

<p>We would like your feedback on a specific aspect of the Fundamental Standards, called the duty of candour (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2936/regulation/20/made" rel="external">Regulation 20</a>).</p>

<p>The duty of candour places a legal duty on all health and/or social care providers to be open and transparent with people using services in relation to their treatment and care. It also sets out some specific actions that providers must take when a notifiable safety incident occurs. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>informing the relevant person affected about the incident</li>
  <li>providing reasonable support</li>
  <li>providing an account that is, to the best of their knowledge, true of all the facts known</li>
  <li>an apology</li>
  <li>a written record that is kept secure</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h2>Section 3: Care Quality Commission (Reviews and Performance Assessments) Regulations 2018</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.legislation.gov.uk%2Fuksi%2F2018%2F54%2Fmade&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmeena.paterson%40dhsc.gov.uk%7C922be24f2a8d44b3b14b08d9f551bb20%7C61278c3091a84c318c1fef4de8973a1c%7C1%7C0%7C637810553636569020%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=nKDMXqtA%2BA9iEFEAgmCdQ91HtIirkKtS0m42PavYvu8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">Care Quality Commission (Reviews and Performance Assessments) Regulations 2018</a></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> began ratings of providers in October 2014. However, it was limited to specific settings to allow time for the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to build capacity. Subsequently, we consulted on proposals to expand the scope of the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>’s duty to extend performance assessments and ratings to a variety of additional providers, including many of the independent sector providers, who carry out regulated activities.</p>

<p>While considering changes to the ratings regime, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> concluded that it would be beneficial to broaden the scope of the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>’s ratings regulations so that, with some exceptions, all providers of regulated activities are rated. The small number of providers who are excluded from ratings are, however, subject to the fundamental standards of care and to inspections. The reasons for exclusion are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of providers is so small that ratings would not contribute to consumer choice</li>
  <li>the service providers are already regulated by other agencies so a <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> rating could confuse the public</li>
  <li>the sector is relatively low risk and is inspected by the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> too infrequently to make a rating meaningful</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers that were excluded from ratings are primary dental care, minor cosmetic surgery services, national screening programmes, health and justice services, hyperbaric chambers, blood and transplant services, services licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and independent pathology laboratories, independent podiatry services and children’s homes undertaking regulated activities.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question</p>

<p>Do you agree or disagree that the above mentioned providers should not be included in the CQC’s ratings regime?</p>

<ul>
  <li>strongly agree</li>
  <li>agree</li>
  <li>disagree</li>
  <li>strongly disagree</li>
</ul>

<h3>Provider information returns</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> asks for information about the services you provide each year, including any changes that have been made and how your organisation ensures the service is safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led. This is known as a provider information return (<abbr title="provider information return">PIR</abbr>).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question</p>

<p>Who worked on your organisation’s most recent provider information return?</p>

<p>Please include job titles, full time (gross) annual salary and estimated hours each individual spent on this PIR or assessment.</p>

<h3>Inspections</h3>

<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> carried out remote inspections to lessen the burden on providers and has subsequently changed the way it carries out inspections by taking a more intelligence-led and risk-based approach. As a result, we are aware that some providers may not have had an on-site inspection for at least 2 years.</p>

<p>The following questions relate to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic inspection regime based on routine programme of on-site inspections. Where these questions ask you to think about your most recent inspection, please answer with reference to your most recent on-site inspection.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Question</p>
