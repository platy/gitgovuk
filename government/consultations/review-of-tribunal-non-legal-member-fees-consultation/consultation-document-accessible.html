<p><strong>Review of Tribunal Non-Legal Member Fees</strong></p>

<p>The Review Body on Senior Salaries provides independent advice to the Government on the remuneration of senior civil servants, the judiciary, senior officers of the armed forces, senior managers in the NHS in England and Department of Health and Social Care arm’s lengths bodies, Police and Crime Commissioners and chief police officers.</p>

<p>In March 2021, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> was commissioned by the Lord Chancellor to review, and make recommendations on, the current daily sitting fee rates for Non-Legal Members (NLMs) of tribunals in England and Wales, the non-devolved tribunals in Scotland and devolved tribunal posts in Northern Ireland. As set out in the Terms of Reference (Appendix A), the objectives of the Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review whether the current daily sitting fee rates (and salaries) are correctly set and appropriate</li>
  <li>review the consistency in the rate of remuneration paid to NLMs for comparable work across the different tribunals, and provide options to achieve greater consistency</li>
  <li>assess the extent of any issues with recruitment and retention of NLMs and examine the causes and impact of any issues identified</li>
  <li>make recommendations on the appropriate salary or fees for NLMs in scope of the review in light of evidence received and the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s judgement</li>
  <li>make observations on the consistency (including when and on what basis they are made) and quantum and other relevant issues relating to the payment of additional fees paid to NLMs</li>
  <li>make any other relevant recommendations as appropriate in light of the information received and the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s judgement</li>
</ul>

<p>The Terms of Reference also require the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>, in reaching its recommendations, to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>affordability, and legal and operational constraints</li>
  <li>the relative responsibilities, experience, qualifications and skills of different <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles</li>
  <li>the need to recruit, retain and motivate sufficient high-quality NLMs</li>
  <li>the rates of daily sitting fees/salary paid to comparable <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles in the unified tribunals and to other relevant external market comparators for <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles where there is a specific recruitment or retention issue, where appropriate</li>
  <li>the impact of any proposals on diversity and inclusivity, having regard to obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and Northern Ireland Act 1998</li>
  <li>that NLMs now receive pension benefit (this is under consideration for devolved Northern Ireland NLMs), and this should be taken into account</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the evidence-gathering process, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> is running this consultation for stakeholders. The consultation seeks views on the principles underpinning the review and on particular issues we are considering. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> would welcome views from consultees before it presents its final recommendations to the Government.</p>

<p><strong>The Consultation</strong></p>

<p>Context</p>

<p>The most recent review of <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> daily sitting fees was conducted over a decade ago <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> as part of the major overhaul of the Tribunals Service following the implementation of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s recommendations in the 2008 Review for NLMs were not accepted by the Government at the time. Although there have been some annual uplifts in daily sitting fees in line with judicial pay awards, the underpinning <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> rates have remained those set by the various Departments that ‘sponsored’ the different tribunals before they were placed under the Tribunal Service as part of the 2007 Act.</p>

<p>The Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees will look at the current fee structure with the aim of achieving greater consistency and simplification within and between the tribunals. As set out in the Terms of Reference, the Ministry of Justice has said that the rate of fees paid to individual NLMs currently in post will not decrease as a result of this Review due to the statutory protection for salaries paid to judicial office holders in the courts. This is applied, by convention, to tribunal judicial office holders, given the importance of judicial independence from the Executive.
In addition to a daily sitting fee, NLMs in some tribunals can also claim additional fees for items such as preparation and writing time. Consultees should note that these additional fees are outside of the remit of the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>, though we may make observations about them in the light of the empirical evidence we receive. The <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> has proposed that the issues of additional fees will be reviewed separately alongside the Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees to ensure there is greater consistency between the tribunals.</p>

<p>This Consultation represents only one element in the evidence <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> is gathering for the Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees. We have other evidence, including: an evidence pack of job descriptions, <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> composition and recent recruitment and retention data, compiled by the <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>, with the help of an Advisory Group of <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> members; a survey of current NLMs carried out by the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>; and independent evidence about labour market comparators commissioned by the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is an open consultation, but responses are particularly welcome from NLMs whose posts are included in the scope of the Review and their representative associations, as well as from tribunal judges. The posts in scope of the Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees are at Appendix B.</p>

<p>Consultation questions</p>

<p>This Consultation asks respondents to consider a series of questions and provide their views on and evidence about: some of the principles underpinning the Review; a possible model for simplification and to achieve consistency; and factors affecting recruitment and retention of the number and quality of NLMs that are needed.
Respondents are not required to answer every question if they do not wish to. Brief supporting arguments and evidence are welcomed. The questions are presented, in context, in Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 and as a complete list in Section 5.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Section 1: Underpinning principles</h2>

<p>1.1 As part of our early work with the <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>, the <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Advisory Group, tribunal judges and others, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> has identified some principles that will inform our recommendations about <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> fees structures and levels. Consultees should note that the principles that the <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> may apply to inform their implementation of any changes may differ from those proposed by the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.2 NLMs play an important role in tribunal decisions, bringing personal or professional experience and expertise on a range of specialist areas. Although their views are given equal weight in decision-making, it is the legally qualified tribunal judge who advises on points of law and who (normally) chairs the panel and writes up the decision.</p>

<p>Principle 1: <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> daily sitting fees should not exceed those of the tribunal judge.</p>

<p>1.3 On occasion, NLMs are asked to hear cases alone, or act as the tribunal chair in the absence of a judge. We believe that the responsibility of this role should be reflected in the daily sitting fees.</p>

<p>Principle 2: NLMs acting as a tribunal chair should be paid the same daily sitting fee as the tribunal judge.</p>

<p>1.4	Currently, for medical members of the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal, a higher fee rate is paid for those who sit for 20 days or more in a financial year. Our early consultations and deliberations provide no rationale for this and indeed we believe it could impede recruitment of medical members to this tribunal.</p>

<p>Principle 3: Fee rates should not be differentiated by the number of sitting days undertaken over the course of a year.</p>

<p>1.5	The final principle we have identified is based on geographic location. While labour market factors might suggest differentiation of fees by geographic location, the principle of having a unified Tribunal Service argues against such distinctions. This principle is supported by the <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> and the Northern Ireland Office and in effect mirrors one the principles in our 2018 Major Review of the Judicial Salary Structure<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Principle 4: The geographic location of the tribunal should not affect <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> fee rates.</p>

<p>Consultation questions on underpinning principles</p>

<p>Question 1: Do you agree with principle 1 that <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> daily sitting fees should not exceed those of the tribunal judge?</p>

<p>Question 2:  Do you agree with principle 2 that NLMs acting as a tribunal chair should be paid the same daily sitting fee as the tribunal judge?</p>

<p>Question 3: Do you agree with principle 3 that fee rates should not be differentiated by the number of sitting days undertaken over the course of a year?</p>

<p>Question 4: Do you agree with principle 4 that the geographic location of the tribunal should not affect <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> fee rates?</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Section 2: Daily sitting fee rates (and salaries)</h2>

<p>2.1 The aim of the Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees is to introduce a simplified and transparent fee structure which provides consistency of pay for NLMs sitting on different tribunals. There are variations between the current daily sitting fee rates for NLMs of different types.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> For example, in England and Wales the daily sitting fee for a lay member in the Employment Tribunal is £195, whereas the sitting fee for a medical member in the Health, Education and Social Care Chamber is £508. These fees have not been reviewed since 2008. Moreover, there has also been no recent examination of the roles played by different types of NLMs.</p>

<p>2.2 As our Major Review of the Judicial Salary Structure showed, accurate job descriptions are an important starting point for our work. The <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> and Judicial Office led a process which compiled and reviewed the job descriptions of the 37 different types of NLMs. While there are some differences in their roles, for the most part the roles and responsibilities of different types of NLMs in the various tribunals are broadly comparable.</p>

<p>2.3 This is an important piece of evidence for the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>, given the need for consistency between NLMs of different types. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> also needs, however, to consider labour market facing evidence where <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles require specific skills, expertise and/or professional qualifications, and where there is evidence about recruitment challenges for particular roles. As set out in the Terms of Reference for the Review, as indeed with all its work, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> must consider the need to recruit, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of high-quality NLMs.</p>

<p>2.4 While there was a hiatus in <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> recruitment for several years after 2010, recruitment of NLMs has restarted since 2017, though not for all types of NLMs or tribunals. This recent recruitment activity has been largely successful but has resulted in shortfalls for some <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles. Evidence submitted to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> suggests that recruitment difficulties exist for some specialist occupations where it has been challenging to recruit enough high-quality individuals.</p>

<p>2.5 While <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> retention rates have historically been high (reducing recruitment pressures), the existing <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> workforce is ageing; given statutory retirement ages, a larger volume of recruitment will be needed in future. We also note secular changes in the growth of portfolio part-time working and changed expectations with regard to this, which work differently in some professions and occupations. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> will therefore want to consider possible future developments as well as current evidence in making its recommendations.</p>

<p>2.6 Based on its initial examination of the evidence to hand, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> wishes to consult about some aspects of its early thinking. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> will then use all the evidence, including responses to this Consultation, to develop its final recommendations.</p>

<p>The fee system</p>

<p>2.7 Based on our initial examination of the evidence, and the submission from the <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>, we are considering the following elements of a system for sitting fees:</p>

<p>a.  On the basis of the evidence from the job descriptions, much of the data about recruitment, and our remit for consistency and simplification, we are considering whether to recommend a ‘base rate’ for daily sitting fees for all NLMs. This would recognise the valued roles played by NLMs of all types.</p>

<p>b. Given the evidence of recruitment shortfalls or difficulties and labour market-facing evidence about why those might arise, we are also considering whether to recommend a small number of levels of ‘supplementary sitting fees’ to be paid in addition to the ‘base rate’ for <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles requiring specific skills, expertise and/or professional qualifications, where evidence exists of recruitment shortfalls. Our aim would be to have the smallest number of supplementary sitting fee rates that we judge necessary to meet specific skills needs or recruitment challenges.</p>

<p>c. We are currently reviewing evidence about these issues. Among the roles we are considering as eligible for supplementary sitting fees are those requiring medical qualifications, and some requiring specific property or financial expertise or professional qualifications where there is evidence of recruitment challenges.</p>

<p>d. A final issue is about the role of NLMs sitting on Upper Tribunals. Their job descriptions and responsibilities are comparable to those sitting in first-instance tribunals. We will consider if there are compelling reasons why NLMs sitting on Upper Tribunals should receive a higher daily sitting fee.</p>

<p>Views on the perceived merits or disadvantages of such an approach are welcome.</p>

<p>Consultation questions on daily sitting fee rates (and salaries)</p>

<p>Question 5: Do you agree or disagree that all NLMs should receive the same base rate but with provision for a small number of levels of supplementary sitting fee rates for roles requiring professional qualifications or expertise where recruitment and labour market evidence suggests they are needed?</p>

<p>Question 6: In your view, are there compelling reasons for NLMs sitting on Upper Tribunals to receive a higher daily sitting fee?</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Section 3: Additional fees</h2>

<p>3.1 As set out earlier in this document, additional fees – fees other than daily sitting fees – are outside of the remit of the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s Review of Tribunal <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> Fees. Given the range of evidence the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> is considering, however, it has been agreed that the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> may make observations on the issue of additional fees if there is evidence that would be useful to the proposed <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> review of these additional fees.</p>

<p>3.2 In addition to the daily sitting fee, NLMs in some tribunals can claim additional fees for tasks such as preparation and writing times. Current inconsistences in the both the quantum of and the eligibility for these payments affect the total remuneration for the <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> role; some of these apply to tribunal judges as well. There are also different policies regarding training fees.</p>

<p>3.3 The response to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s survey of NLMs suggests that the main concerns of respondents were about fees paid for reading and preparation time and cancellation fees. Many respondents highlighted concerns that the additional fees paid did not adequately compensate for either the amount of preparatory work required or the impact of short-notice cancellations. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> would therefore welcome views on these two particular issues.</p>

<p>Consultation questions on additional fees</p>

<p>Question 7: One possibility is that the daily sitting fee could include some recognition of basic ‘preparation time’, leaving additional fees for a smaller number of circumstances when they are warranted. This was an issue also raised by the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> 2008 Review. What is your view on this?</p>

<p>Question 8: In your view, what would be an adequate compensatory mechanism to reflect the impact of short-notice cancellations (of 48 hours or less)?</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Section 4: Recruitment and retention</h2>

<p>4.1 For many years there was little recruitment of NLMs as numbers were deemed sufficient for tribunals to function and austerity reduced all court and tribunal recruitment. More recently, however, recruitment activity has increased, though there remain some <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles for whom little recruitment activity has taken place since 2017.</p>

<p>4.2 Evidence submitted by the <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> and the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> survey of NLMs in May 2021 indicate that existing NLMs have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the majority of NLMs are over 60 years old</li>
  <li>the large majority of NLMs sit on a part-time or occasional basis</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> positions are often filled by people who have either retired or do only part-time paid work alongside their <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> role. This may in part be to do with age, but also due to other requirements of <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> service, which make the role difficult to combine with many other paid roles unless employers positively enable it or NLMs are self-employed</li>
  <li>NLMs generally do not wish to retire before their current statutory retirement age of 70, so that the main reason for NLMs leaving the role is often retirement. As the judicial retirement age is expected to rise to 75, it is likely that <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> retirement age will also rise. This provides some additional time for workforce planning but active recruitment of future NLMs will still be important.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.3 The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> recognises the need both to ensure that the incentives to apply for an <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> role are sufficient, and for strategic workforce planning, including the development of a cadre of experienced NLMs who can assist the tribunals in various ways.</p>

<p>4.4 Apart from pay rates, the SRRB is interested in the views of NLMs on how the role of an <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> could be made more attractive, particularly to younger or more diverse prospective applicants.</p>

<p>Consultation questions on recruitment and retention</p>

<p>Question 9: What changes other than changes to fees could be made to make the role of an <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> more attractive?
Question 10: How could the role of an <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> be made more attractive to younger or more diverse applicants?</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Section 5: Consultation questions</h2>

<p>5.1 For ease of reference, the consultation questions are listed here.</p>

<p>Underpinning principles</p>

<p>Question 1: Do you agree with principle 1 that <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> daily sitting fees should not exceed those of the tribunal judge?</p>

<p>Question 2: Do you agree with principle 2 that NLMs acting as a tribunal chair should be paid the same daily sitting fee as the tribunal judge?</p>

<p>Question 3: Do you agree with principle 3 that fee rates should not be differentiated by the number of sitting days undertaken over the course of a year?</p>

<p>Question 4: Do you agree with principle 4 that the geographic location of the tribunal should not affect <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> fee rates?</p>

<p>Daily sitting fee rates (and salaries)</p>

<p>Question 5: Do you agree or disagree that all NLMs should receive the same base rate but with provision for a small number of levels of supplementary sitting fee rates for roles requiring professional qualifications or expertise where recruitment and labour market evidence suggests they are needed?</p>

<p>Question 6: In your view, are there compelling reasons for NLMs sitting on Upper Tribunals to receive a higher daily sitting fee?</p>

<p>Additional fees</p>

<p>Question 7: One possibility is that the daily sitting fee could include some recognition of basic ‘preparation time’, leaving additional fees for a smaller number of circumstances when they are warranted. This was an issue also raised by the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> 2008 Review. What is your view on this?</p>

<p>Question 8: In your view, what would be an adequate compensatory mechanism to reflect the impact of short-notice cancellations (of 48 hours or less)?</p>

<p>Recruitment and retention</p>

<p>Question 9: What changes other than changes to fees could be made to make the role of an <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> more attractive?</p>

<p>Question 10: How could the role of an <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> be made more attractive to younger or more diverse applicants?</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Appendix A: Terms of reference for the Non-Legal Member Fees Review</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Background</h3>

<p>1.1 Fees for non-legal members (NLMs) in the tribunals were last reviewed in 2008 as part of the major overhaul of the Tribunals Service following the implementation of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Fees for NLMs in devolved tribunals in Northern Ireland have never been subject to over-arching review. Fee-paid NLMs were out of scope of the Senior Salaries Review Body’s (<abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>) Major Review of the Judicial Salary Structure in 2018.</p>

<p>1.2  The rate of fees paid to individual NLMs will not decrease as a result of this review due to the statutory protection for salaries paid to judicial office holders in the courts, which is applied, by convention, to tribunal judicial office holders, given the importance of judicial independence from the Executive.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>

<p>1.3 The objectives of the NLMs’ fees review are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review whether the current daily sitting fee rates (and salaries) are correctly set and appropriate</li>
  <li>review the consistency in the rate of remuneration paid to NLMs for comparable work across the different tribunals, and provide options to achieve greater consistency</li>
  <li>assess the extent of any issues with recruitment and retention of NLMs and examine the causes and impact of any issues identified</li>
  <li>make recommendations on the appropriate salary or fees for NLMs in scope of the review in light of evidence received and the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s judgement</li>
  <li>make observations on the consistency (including when and on what basis they are made) and quantum and other relevant issues relating to the payment of Additional fees <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> paid to NLMs</li>
  <li>make any other relevant recommendations as appropriate in light of the information received and the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s judgement</li>
</ul>

<p>1.4  In reaching its recommendations, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>affordability, and legal and operational constraints</li>
  <li>the relative responsibilities, experience, qualifications and skills of different <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles</li>
  <li>the need to recruit, retain and motivate sufficient high-quality NLMs</li>
  <li>the rates of daily sitting fees / salary paid to comparable <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles in the unified tribunals and to other relevant external market comparators for <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles where there is a specific recruitment or retention issue, where appropriate</li>
  <li>the impact of any proposals on diversity and inclusivity, having regard to obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and Northern Ireland Act 1998</li>
  <li>NLMs now receive pension benefit (this is under consideration for devolved Northern Ireland NLMs), and this should be taken into account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scope</p>

<p>Tribunals and NLMs</p>

<p>1.5  Appendix B provides a list of all tribunals in scope.</p>

<p>1.6 NLMs in the devolved tribunals Northern Ireland are in scope of this review, whilst those in the devolved tribunals of Wales and Scotland are out of scope, in line with the stated wishes of the Devolved Administrations.</p>

<p>1.7 NLMs in tribunals which fall outside of the unified tribunals structure or which are sponsored by other government departments, other than those listed at paragraphs 5 and 6, are not in scope of this review.</p>

<p>1.8 Valuer Chairs in the Property Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal are out of scope as they receive the same pay and benefits as a judge in that Chamber, despite being described as “Other Member” in the Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. For the avoidance of doubt, fee-paid Valuer Members are in scope of this review.</p>

<p>1.9 Surveyor Members, Upper Tribunal (Lands) are out of scope of this review as their pay was reviewed in the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s Major Review. Based on those recommendations, this office moved to salary group 6.1 with effect from 1 October 2019 (subsequently to 5.1 following the 2020 Annual Review).</p>

<p>1.10 Although out of scope for assessing appropriate remuneration, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> may have regard to the responsibilities of these two <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles (Valuer Chairs and Surveyor Members) if it considers it appropriate to do so when considering consistency across the tribunals.</p>

<p>1.11 The Non-Legal Chair in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeal Tribunal can be authorised to act as a Chair of the panel, even when a legal member is present. The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> will need to consider the appropriate remuneration for NLMs both as a Panel Member and as a Chair.
1.12	A full list of all <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> offices in scope of this review is set out at Appendix B<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Specific issues</p>

<p>1.13 Within the scope of the review as set out above, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> should also consider the following specific issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the difference in responsibilities between Salaried (Regional) Medical Members and fee-paid Medical Members in the Social Entitlement and War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Chambers, and whether different rates of remuneration should be paid to these groups taking into account the day-to-day responsibilities of their roles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact of paying a higher rate to medical members in Social Security and Child Support (<abbr title="Social Security Child Support">SSCS</abbr>) who sit for 20 days or more per financial year on recruitment, retention and morale, and whether this practice should continue</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.14 The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> should also have regard to the potential impact of <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr> reform on the <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> role.</p>

<p>Governance</p>

<p>The Ministry of Justice</p>

<p>1.15 Remuneration for non-devolved judicial office holders, including NLMs, which are determined by the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>1.16 The relevant policy team within the Ministry of Justice (<abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>) will be responsible for setting the remit and evidence-gathering in consultation with the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.17 The <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> team will convene an officials-led group consisting of <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service">HMCTS</abbr>, Judicial Office and a representative from the Senior President of Tribunals’ office to help compile the data and other evidence required for the review.</p>

<p>1.18 <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>, working with Judicial Office, the <abbr title="Senior President of Tribunals">SPT</abbr>’s office and the Northern Ireland (NI) Devolved Administration, will lead on compiling evidence for the review. This will comprise a joint data pack and additional evidence pack. Evidence will be approved by Lord Chancellor and <abbr title="Senior President of Tribunals">SPT</abbr> before submission to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.19 <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr>, (and the NI Devolved Administration for NI devolved tribunals) will produce its own written evidence submission for the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> representing the views of the Department on the issues to be addressed within the review and proposals.</p>

<p>1.20 <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> will publish its response to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s recommendations. This will have been agreed by the Lord Chancellor and cross-government prior to publication.</p>

<p>1.21 MOJ will consider recommendations by taking in to account, the evidence, operational viability, legal and equalities considerations and other relevant factors in the context of the prevailing public sector pay policy. This may make it is necessary to delay or stage some or all elements of implementation.</p>

<p>Judicial Office</p>

<p>1.22 Judicial Office is responsible for co-ordinating judicially-agreed role descriptions for all posts in scope of this Review (except posts in devolved tribunals for which the relevant Devolved Administration will be responsible).</p>

<p>1.23 Judicial Office will also assist the senior judiciary in producing the joint data pack and subsequent judicial written evidence submission for the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>, which will represent the views of the senior judiciary on the issues to be addressed within the Review.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland</p>

<p>1.24 Remuneration for devolved judicial office-holders in Northern Ireland, including NLMs, is determined by three Northern Ireland departments: the Department of Justice (<abbr title="Department of Justice">DoJ</abbr>), the Department for the Economy and the Department for Communities. The Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission (<abbr title="Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission">NIJAC</abbr>) is responsible for appointing some NLMs and departments are responsible for others.</p>

<p>1.25 Decisions on the Northern Ireland administration’s response to the Review’s recommendations will be made independently of those made by the Lord Chancellor in relation to non-devolved NLMs.</p>

<p>1.26 <abbr title="Department of Justice">DoJ</abbr> will publish the Northern Ireland response to the Review recommendations. This will have been agreed by the three relevant departments in Northern Ireland prior to publication.</p>

<p>Advisory Group</p>

<p>1.27 An Advisory Group will be convened by <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> to provide advice in the gathering of evidence for the review.</p>

<p>1.28 The Chairs and members will be appointed to the Advisory Group by the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Senior President of Tribunals.</p>

<p>1.29 The composition of the Advisory Group will be representative of a range of different <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> roles, and other relevant stakeholders. Members of the Advisory Group must be capable of reflecting objectively on evidence and data.</p>

<p>1.30 The Advisory Group should consist of;</p>

<ul>
  <li>A judicial representative and an <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> official (Joint Chairs)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> of the First-tier Tribunal</li>
  <li>1 <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> of the Upper Tier Tribunal</li>
  <li>1 <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> of the Employment Tribunal</li>
  <li>1 Medical Member</li>
  <li>1 Disability Member</li>
  <li>1 Valuer Member</li>
  <li>2 NLMs from NI Tribunals</li>
  <li>1 Legal Member from either Upper or First-tier Tribunal</li>
  <li>1 Legal Member from outside tribunals</li>
  <li>Sharon Witherspoon (<abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>, ex officio)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Although not members of the Advisory Group, officials from Ministry of Justice, Judicial Office or Office of Manpower Economics may attend as appropriate and with the agreement of the Joint Chairs.</p>

<p>1.31 Fee-paid members of the Advisory Group will be paid for their time.</p>

<p>1.32 The Advisory Group will provide advice during the review to inform and shape the evidence base. Frequency of meetings, the time commitment expected of Advisory Group members and the rates at which fee-paid members will be remunerated for their time will be agreed by <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> and the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> in consultation with the <abbr title="Senior President of Tribunals">SPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Senior Salaries Review Body</p>

<p>1.33 <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> will commission the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> to undertake this Review.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>1.34 The <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> is responsible for making recommendations and observations to government which fulfil the Review’s purpose and objectives as set out in paragraphs 3-4 above.</p>

<p>1.35 As part of its normal way of working, the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> will ensure there is an opportunity for judicial associations, the <abbr title="Senior President of Tribunals">SPT</abbr>’s <abbr title="Non -Legal Members">NLM</abbr> working group, individual NLMs and other relevant stakeholders to submit evidence directly to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> to be considered as part of its deliberations.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous</p>

<p>1.36 <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> cannot guarantee that there will be no tax implications as a result of any changes introduced in response to this Review. The twin priorities for <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> are to ensure the effective use of public money and ensure that NLMs are appropriately remunerated for the work they do.</p>

<p>1.37 <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> will conduct an Equality Impact Analysis of any proposed changes to ensure the policy is consistent with the Lord Chancellor’s statutory equality duties and supportive of the government’s aim of promoting judicial diversity.</p>

<p>Timings</p>

<p>1.38 The Lord Chancellor will write to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> to formally commission the review.</p>

<p>1.39 Once the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> has accepted the Lord Chancellor’s commission, the evidence phase will commence. This is expected to be completed by June 2021.</p>

<p>1.40 <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> will draft a report which is expected to be submitted to <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> and the relevant Northern Ireland departments in January 2022 (subject to evidence delivery).</p>

<p>1.41 We anticipate that <abbr title="Ministry of Justice">MoJ</abbr> will respond to the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr>’s report by March 2022.
Note: later completion of the evidence phase (paragraph 1.38 above) means that the <abbr title="Review Body on Senior Salaries">SSRB</abbr> now expects to submit its report in the spring of 2022.</p>
