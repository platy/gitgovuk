<h4>Consultation 22 November 2021</h4>

<h3>FOREWORD</h3>
<p>by Rt. Hon. Ben Wallace MP, Secretary of State for Defence</p>

<p>In 2015 public service pensions were reformed in order to make them sustainable and affordable over the long term, while ensuring that they would continue to provide excellent pensions for public service workers. In 2018, the Court of Appeal found that one part of the reforms, which had treated older members differently to younger co-workers by allowing them to remain in their legacy scheme until retirement, was unjustified age discrimination. In 2020, the Government consulted widely on options to remedy that discrimination. In its Response to the Consultation, the Government confirmed that the reformed pension schemes themselves were not discriminatory, and announced that, with effect from 1 April 2022, the legacy schemes would be closed to all members and that all serving members would continue as members of the reformed schemes from that date.</p>

<p>The Government has now introduced a Bill into parliament which will close the legacy schemes on this date. It is necessary to make amendments to the scheme rules as a result of this, to ensure that they will continue to work smoothly for the members who will transfer to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 2015 on 1 April 2022. This consultation sets out the detail of changes we will make to the schemes in this regard as well as other technical amendments to ensure the smooth running of the schemes.</p>

<p>The Government remains confident that the reformed schemes provide excellent pension provision for the Armed Forces, and that the move away from final salary in the reformed scheme design results in a fairer pension system overall.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Government has introduced legislation, the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Bill 2021 (“the Bill”), to address the discrimination that arose when the public service pension schemes were reformed in 2015, and some members were given full protection in their legacy schemes.</p>

<p>This discrimination arose because transitional protection was offered to some (older) members – following negotiations with member representatives – alongside the introduction of the reformed pension schemes in 2015. This was intended to protect and give certainty to people who were close to retirement. In December 2018, the Court of Appeal found that transitional protection arrangements, which allowed certain members of the judicial and firefighters pension schemes to remain in their existing schemes when they were closed to other members, gave rise to unlawful discrimination, as transitional protection was only offered to older scheme members. In July 2019 the Government confirmed that it accepted that the Court’s judgment had implications for the other public service schemes that had similar transitional arrangements.</p>

<p>Once enacted, the Bill will close the legacy schemes to further accrual from 1 April 2022 onwards, with all active members who continue in service on that date moved into the relevant reformed schemes: in the case of the Armed Forces these are the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 and <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 15 schemes. The Bill applies across the main public service pension schemes including the Armed Forces Pension Schemes (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr>).</p>

<p>This consultation relates to amendments to the rules of the various <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr>. As the Bill closes the pre-2015 legacy schemes to further accrual from 1 April 2022, it is necessary to make consequential amendments to the rules of the various schemes for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to ensure all active members, who were full protection members<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> in a legacy scheme until 31 March 2022, and who continue in service have access to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 from that date</li>
  <li>to make other minor changes to ensure the scheme rules are in accordance with the primary legislation</li>
  <li>to remedy previous errors in scheme rules applying to transition members</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of publication, the drafting of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> has not been finalised and this may therefore change. However, this consultation sets out the policy intent behind the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> and invites your comments on that as well.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Consultation process</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Defence will consult the list of stakeholders identified in Annex A, but this is a public consultation and we would welcome all views on the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> to amend the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>	Who this consultation is aimed at</h3>
<p>This consultation applies to the regular and reserve UK Armed Forces personnel.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>	Consultation questions</h3>
<p>Respondents are invited to consider the following questions:</p>

<h4>Question 1</h4>

<p>(1)	The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Bill closes legacy pension schemes to further accrual from 1 April 2022 and ensures that all public service workers who continue in service do so as members of reformed 2015 pension schemes. Do you agree that the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> ensure that from 1 April 2022 all serving personnel who were full protection members on 31 March 2022 will transition to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 and begin to accrue benefits under that scheme?<br>
(2)	If ‘no’, why?<br>
(3)	Are there any other changes needed to ensure the rules of the various Armed Forces pension schemes achieve this aim?<br>
(4)	Are there any equality impacts as a result of the proposed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> to implement the closure of the legacy schemes that the Department has not identified and needs to take account of?<br>
(5)	Are there any additional comments you wish to provide with regard to the proposed changes to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme as set out in this document?</p>

<h4>Question 2</h4>

<p>(1)	Do you agree that the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> retrospectively correct an error in the 2015 Transitional Schedules relating to Full Protection Members and Re-joiners in <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05?<br>
(2)	Do you agree that the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a>  achieve the purpose of correcting errors retrospectively in respect of the following?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrospectively amending the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05 to require that an application for the secondment Additional Voluntary Contribution (<abbr title="additional voluntary contributions">AVC</abbr>) is accompanied by an application for added pension under <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15</li>
  <li>Retrospectively inserting the secondment <abbr title="additional voluntary contributions">AVC</abbr> into the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05</li>
  <li>Retrospectively amending the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 to ensure that a person who had opted out of the legacy scheme remains opted out of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15</li>
</ul>

<p>(3)	If ‘no’, why?</p>

<h4>Question 3</h4>
<p>(1)	Government policy in cases where the medical boarding process has commenced before 1 April 2022 is that all active members will transfer to the new scheme on 1 April 2022. However, schemes may amend their rules to provide an ‘ill health underpin’ to ensure members are not disadvantaged by moving to the new scheme. MOD has assessed benefits paid in these circumstances and does not consider that members in these circumstances would receive lower benefits, hence, MOD does not consider it necessary to implement an underpin. Do you have any views on this policy?<br>
(2)	Do you believe any changes to scheme rules are required to implement this policy intent?<br>
(3)	If yes, which rules require amendments and why?</p>

<h4>Question 4</h4>

<p>(1)	Are there any further considerations that you think the Department should take into account when assessing any equality issues arising as a result of the proposed amendments?<br>
(2)	If yes, please give your reasons and supporting statement.<br>
(3)	Is there anything that could be done to mitigate the impacts you have identified?</p>

<h4>Question 5</h4>

<p>Do you have any further comments on either the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> retrospectively or the equalities impact of the proposals set out in this consultation?</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>	Public Sector Equality Duty</h3>
<p>The proposals covered in this consultation have been assessed by reference to the public sector equality duty contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">Equality Act 2010</a>. This requires the MOD to pay due regard to the need to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.	eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Act;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.	advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.	foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.</p>

<p>We do not believe that the proposals will result in any unlawful direct, or indirect discrimination. These are set out in more detail in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">Equalities Impact Assessment</a> published alongside this document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Changes to the Armed Forces Pension Schemes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Context</h3>

<p>As part of the 2015 pension reforms, those within 10 years of retirement on 31 March 2012 remained in their legacy pension schemes. This transitional protection arrangement was determined by a Court to be unlawful age discrimination<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and the Government set out its proposals to address that discrimination in a public consultation in 2020. The rationale for reforming public service pensions, and introducing the reformed schemes still stands. The Government remains of the view that the 2015 schemes offer appropriate pension provision and address the objectives of affordability and sustainability.</p>

<p>The reformed schemes themselves are not discriminatory, and the Government believes that moving all active members into the reformed schemes going forward ensures that they are treated equally in respect of the scheme design available to them for future service. These plans achieve this, but if some members were able to remain in legacy schemes while others were not, this key objective would not be met.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Government intends that all members of the main unfunded public service pension schemes (excluding judges) who continue in service from 1 April 2022 onwards will do so as members of their respective reformed scheme. Legacy schemes will be closed in relation to service after 31 March 2022, bringing the discrimination to an end.</p>

<p>The rules of the various schemes need to be amended to ensure that they reflect the primary legislation, allowing members who move to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 on 1 April 2022 to accrue benefits on the same basis as those who moved in 2015. Further, some technical changes were not properly implemented in 2015 and these will be incorporated into legislation to ensure the rules work as intended for all members.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Legislation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>	Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Bill 2021</h3>
<p>The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Bill 2021 was introduced on 19 July 2021 and is currently going through Parliament. This Bill, among other measures to remedy the discrimination found by the Court of Appeal, provides that all pre-2015 schemes (legacy schemes) will close for the purposes of future accrual of benefits on 31 March 2022. The effect of this is that it will no longer be possible to accrue benefits in those schemes for periods of service on or after 1 April 2022. The draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> on which we are now consulting will amend the rules of the various Armed Forces pension schemes to ensure that they are in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, making the necessary changes to permit formerly protected members to join the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 from 1 April 2022, and to accrue benefits in that scheme on the same basis as those who moved in 2015.</p>

<p>The Bill also introduces measures to provide a remedy for those who suffered discrimination between the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022. However, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> to implement those measures will be brought forward later in 2022 and this aspect of the remedy is not covered in this consultation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>  Armed Forces Pension Schemes</h3>
<p>Prior to 2015, there were 6 Armed Forces Pension Schemes, which provided benefits for either regular or reserve service. These are collectively known as the legacy schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75)</li>
  <li>Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme 1997 (<abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97)</li>
  <li>Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2005 (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05) and Armed Forces Early Departure Payments Scheme 2005 (<abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 05)</li>
  <li>Reserve Forces Pension Scheme 2005 (<abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05)</li>
  <li>Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75 covers regular members of the Armed Forces who joined before 6 April 2005 and did not transfer to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 2005. The rules of the scheme are contained in Schedules 1 and 3 to three identical instruments, made under a mixture of the royal prerogative and statutory powers. Each instrument sets out the rules of the scheme for one of the Services: Royal Navy (Order in Council), Army (Royal Warrant), and Royal Air Force (Queen’s Order).</p>

<p>In 2010, the rules of the scheme were harmonised and re-stated in new instruments, which are amended from time to time. The original pension rules are found in Schedule 1 (which was replaced in its entirety with effect from 3 January 2011) and Schedule 3 contains the transitional provisions made in 2015. The instruments can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/armed-forces-pension-scheme-1975-regulations">Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 Regulations</a>. It should be noted that the scheme rules have also been amended by other legislation related to the introduction of same sex marriage and opposite sex civil partnerships.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>	<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 05 schemes provide benefits to regular members of the Armed Forces. They were introduced on 6 April 2005 and the rules are contained in two statutory instruments: the Armed Forces Pension Scheme Order (SI 2005/438) and the Armed Forces Early Departure Payments Scheme Order 2005 (SI 2005/437). The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 rules are contained in 2 Schedules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schedule 1, which contains the scheme rules</li>
  <li>Schedule 2, which contains the transitional provisions introduced in 2015</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>	<abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97 is made under the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and provides benefits for members who serve on certain types of reserve commitment. The scheme closed to new members on 5 April 2005. The scheme rules are contained in Defence Council regulations and a second Schedule containing transitional provisions was inserted in 2015.

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>	<abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 2011 rules are contained in regulations made under powers in the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which effectively re-state provisions previously made under Part 3 of Chapter 9 of the Territorial Army Regulations 1978. Schedule 3 to the scheme was inserted in 2015 and contains the transitional provisions. The scheme provides benefits to non-regular permanent staff of the reserve forces and was closed to new members on 1 September 2011.

<span class="number">3.7 </span>	<abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05 was introduced on 6 April 2005 and provides benefits for members of the reserves forces who are on a full-time reserve service commitment, an additional duties commitment, or who are mobilised and who choose to join the scheme. The scheme rules are contained in Defence Council regulations, and Schedule 2 containing transitional provisions was inserted in 2015.

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>	<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15</h3>
<p>On 1 April 2015, the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15) and Armed Forces Early Departure Payments Scheme 2015 (<abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 15) were introduced. The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 provides benefits for all members of the Armed Forces, whether reserve or regular. The <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 15 provides various benefits, some to regulars only and others to regulars and reserves. The rules of both schemes are contained in regulations made under the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 and are amended from time to time. These can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/" rel="external">legislation.gov.uk</a>: SI 2014/2336 and SI 2015/2328.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	The Draft Regulations</h2>
<p>This section explains the impact of the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>	Closure of legacy pension schemes</h3>
<p>All pre-2015 schemes (legacy schemes – see chapter 3) will close on 31 March 2022, under provisions currently found in clause 76(2) of the Bill. The effect of this is that it will no longer be possible to accrue benefits in those schemes for periods of service on or after 1 April 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>	Transitional Provisions</h3>
<p>In 2015 transitional arrangements were established to protect members who had accrued rights to pension in the legacy schemes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. The draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> will ensure that these transitional provisions extend to members who were previously full protection members from 1 April 2022: they will become transition members with continuity of service from that date.</p>

<p>As set out above, these draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> make amendments to the scheme rules, for the following purposes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.	to ensure all active members, who were full protection members in a legacy scheme until 31 March 2022, and who continue in service, have access to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 from that date;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.	to make other minor changes to ensure the scheme rules are in accordance with the primary legislation; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.	to retrospectively remedy previous errors in scheme rules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>	Full protection and access to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15</h3>
<p>Part 2 of the Transitional Schedule in each legacy scheme sets out the criteria for being a full protection member of that scheme – and thus being entitled to remain in the legacy scheme.</p>

<p>The draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> amend the relevant paragraph in Part 2 of each Transitional Schedule which sets out how a member can lose full protection. The draft ensures that full protection will cease for all members at the very latest on 31 March 2022. This ensures that no members can continue to accrue benefits under the legacy schemes in relation to service after 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 of each Transitional Schedule provide that members who lose full protection in this way will become transition members with continuity of service and, as they are in pensionable service on their transition date, they will then become members of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15. Once they are no longer Full Protection members of a legacy scheme, they are eligible for membership of <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 (regulations 14 and 16 <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15).</p>

<p>As these members will be transition members with continuity of service from 1 April 2022, the provisions relating to such membership in the Transitional Schedule for the relevant legacy scheme for their type of service will apply to them, including provisions on the final salary link. Some minor amendments of the provisions are necessary to ensure that this works smoothly for them.</p>

<h4>Minor consequential changes to Scheme Rules: All legacy schemes</h4>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>	Ill Health</h3>

<p>In Part 5 of each Transitional Schedule, provision is currently made in relation to cases where an ill-health pension or lump sum award had been claimed before the member’s transition date, but no decision finally made. In 2015, these provisions permitted a member to remain in their legacy scheme until the final decision on whether an ill-health pension should be awarded had been made. These exemptions were along the same lines as those in Part 2 for full protection members. As the Bill revokes the powers under which these exemptions can be made, such exceptions will no longer be possible after 1 April 2022. This means that all members in the legacy schemes will move to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 on 1 April 2022, with no exceptions. These <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> therefore revoke the 2015 provisions in relation to ill-health claims in train before the member’s transition date.</p>

<p>Government policy in cases where the medical boarding process has commenced before 1 April 2022 is that all active members will transfer to the new scheme on 1 April 2022. However, schemes may amend their rules in relation to this cohort of member, to provide an “ill-health underpin” in the reformed scheme rules if this is considered necessary. Such an underpin would involve making a comparison between what the member would have received had they medically discharged on 31 March 2022, and what they are entitled to as a transition member when they actually discharge on medical grounds. In cases where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the benefits payable on date of actual discharge (accrued rights and new scheme benefits) are lower than the amount that would have been payable on 31 March 2022 from the legacy scheme alone</li>
  <li>the member does not ultimately elect for new scheme benefits for the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>the member would be entitled to receive a top up to their new scheme benefits to bring them up to the value of the benefits that would have been payable under the legacy scheme had they medically discharged on 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>MOD has considered whether such an underpin is required in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> and has concluded that it may not be. The ill-health pension rules in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 and <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 15 are the same as those in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05, <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05. The threshold for an ill-health pension in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97 and <abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11 is that the member meets the threshold for the Tier 1 award under <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Departure Payments Scheme">EDP</abbr> 15. An assessment of the benefits payable to transition members in these circumstances indicates that these would not be lower than those which would have been payable by the relevant legacy scheme had service terminated on 31 March 2022. However, we will consider further whether any changes to scheme rules are required to ensure that a member medically downgraded by a medical board on or before 31 March 2022, but not seen by an employability board until after 1 April 2022 (and where discharge on medical grounds is confirmed), will be treated no less favourably than if the process had been concluded on 31 March 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>	Reckonable service</h3>
<p>This applies to all schemes. In all the legacy schemes, the value of the pension is calculated by reference to, among other factors, the member’s reckonable service in the scheme. Each scheme has different rules regarding what is considered to be reckonable service. MOD has decided to amend the rules relating to reckonable service in each scheme to ensure that it is clear that no further reckonable service can be accrued after 1 April 2022. This is not an essential amendment, as it simply reproduces the effect of clause 72(2) of the Bill. However, as all the legacy schemes are made under different statutory powers, and most are not statutory instruments, it seemed prudent to MOD to make the issue clear in the rules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>	Additional Voluntary Contributions: <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05 all make provision for members to exercise options to purchase additional benefits: these are termed additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) in each scheme. The standard rules on AVCs are different in each scheme and are set out in Part C of Schedule 1 in each scheme. In 2015, apart from three AVCs in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75 (see below), Government policy was that AVCs which had been entered into before the member’s transition date would continue for the original period, and the transitional provisions were drafted on that basis. This remains Government policy: AVCs entered into before 1 April 2022 will remain in place until they reach the end of the agreed term; It will not be possible to enter into new arrangements under legacy scheme rules after 31 March 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>	<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75</h3>
<p>Under Part C of Schedule 1 to this scheme, members could take advantage of 5 different AVCs. Transitional provision in relation to these is found in Part 6 of the Transitional Schedule:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.	purchase of enhanced benefits for the member (based on actual salary rather than representative rate for rank) (rule C4), enhanced benefits for spouse (rule C6) and an enhanced death in service lump sum (rule C8). These benefits were no longer required once a member had moved to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15, and thus provisions in Part 6 of the Transitional Schedule cancelled these three AVCs with effect from the member’s transition date. This will apply to members who transition on 1 April 2022 also. The value of benefits under rule C4 and rule C6 are pro-rated to the member’s transition date and paid in accordance with the scheme rules. A death in service lump sum for a transition member is paid under the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 rules only, with no accrued rights in <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75. The <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 death in service benefit is worth more than the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75 death in service benefit as it is paid at four times the member’s salary, as opposed to three times the member’s representative rate for <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.	purchase of additional reckonable service (rule C1). This <abbr title="additional voluntary contributions">AVC</abbr> ends the day before a member’s 55th birthday. A minor consequential change is required to paragraph 49 of the Transitional Schedule to replace a reference to 31st March 2015 with a reference to the member’s transition date, in order to ensure it works for all transition members, whenever they transferred to <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.	purchase of reckonable service for period of secondment/loan. Minor amendments are required to paragraph 48 of the Transitional Schedule to replace references to 1 April 2015 with a reference to the member’s transition date. Paragraphs 4.10 - 4.12 below set out further information on this type of <abbr title="additional voluntary contributions">AVC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>	<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>Under the rules of this scheme, members had access to two types of <abbr title="additional voluntary contributions">AVC</abbr>: one to purchase additional reckonable service, and one to purchase additional reckonable service to cover a period of secondment/loan (see below at paragraphs 4.10 – 4.12). Paragraph 46 of the Transitional Schedule provides that AVCs to purchase additional reckonable service entered into before 31 March 2015 continued after that date. The draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> simply amend the wording of paragraph 46 to replace references to 31 March 2015 with references to the member’s transition date. This will ensure that the provision works smoothly for those members who transition on 1 April 2022 as well.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span>	<abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>The rules of this scheme provide that members who had a period of secondment or loan and who returned to service immediately after can opt to purchase additional reckonable service to cover the period of the secondment/loan. Paragraph 43 of the Transitional Schedule made consequential amendments in 2015, and these are now further amended by replacing references to 1st April 2015 with the member’s transition date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span>	Secondment/Loan: retrospective provision for purchase of additional reckonable service</h3>

<p>It is not uncommon for service personnel to have a period of secondment or loan to external organisations, (for example, UN or NATO). Some external organisations require that the individual joins their occupational pension scheme for the period of the secondment/loan. These individuals are required to pay member contributions during the period of their secondment/loan. However, as they do not usually vest in the scheme, these contributions are refunded to them when the secondment/loan ends. If the individual returns to Armed Forces service, they are able to purchase additional reckonable service equal to the period of the secondment/loan if they pay over to the scheme all the monies refunded or paid to them in respect of their membership of the external organisation’s pension scheme. The amount required to purchase the additional reckonable service is calculated by the scheme actuary, and in some cases, the amounts paid over by the individual from their secondment scheme are not sufficient to purchase the additional reckonable service required: in such cases the rules provide that the member’s Service pays the difference into the scheme.</p>

<p>MOD policy is that where an individual who would otherwise be an active full protection member of a legacy scheme is on such a secondment/loan over their transition date, and they return to pensionable service in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15, they should be able to purchase additional reckonable service in the legacy scheme equal to the period of the secondment/loan before 31 March 2022. The requirement to pay the full amount of the monies received from the external pension scheme remains. The transitional regulations in 2015 contained footnotes indicating that members would have an option to purchase added pension in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 by way of a lump sum contribution. Regulation 97 of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 is the relevant regulation and is framed in a very similar way to the legacy scheme rules. Both options must be exercised together, and it is not possible to exercise an option in one scheme and not the other. Internally, the scheme manager will calculate, in consultation with the scheme actuary, the amount required to purchase the added years before transition and the added pension after transition, and the lump sum paid in by the member is used to settle this, with the sponsoring unit making up any shortfall.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span>	<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>In 2015, the transitional rules for the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 failed to make this type of provision for those on secondment/loan. This was an error and did not reflect the MOD’s clear policy intent. These draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> will also amend Schedule 2 of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 rules (the Transitional Schedule) to insert a rule to ensure that those members who have been on a relevant secondment/loan which straddles their transition date (whether that is 1 April 2015 or 1 April 2022) are entitled to purchase additional reckonable service for the period up to their transition date. The amendment is made to clarify the requirement which has been implemented in practice since 2015.  This provision will have retrospective effect back to 1 April 2015.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span>	<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>Likewise, amendments are made to the relevant rules in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05 Transitional Schedules to explicitly link the purchase of the added years for secondment option in these schemes to the added pension for secondment option in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15. These provisions will have retrospective effect back to 1 April 2015.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.13 </span>	Retrospective Provision: amending errors in the 2015 Transitional Schedules relating to Full Protection Members and Re-joiners – <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05</h3>
<p>The older legacy schemes (<abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97 and <abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11) were all closed to new members by early September 2011. In 2015, the rules in the Transitional Schedules for these schemes made no provision for full protection to be restored once lost, because a member had left pensionable service under the scheme.</p>

<p>MOD’s policy intent was that where a full protection member of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97 or <abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11 left service and then subsequently re-joined, they could (if they met all the criteria) return as full protection members of the scheme which they could have joined on 31 March 2012. For members of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, this was the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and for members of the <abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97 and the <abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11, this was the <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. This accorded with wider Government policy to allow members of the main public service pension schemes with full protection to move between schemes and to retain that full protection if they met certain criteria (re-joiner policy).</p>

<p>Accordingly, detailed provisions were inserted into the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 and <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05 Transitional Schedules, setting out the circumstances in which individuals who re-joined into regular or reserve service, having left a scheme in which they had had full protection, could retain that protection. Paragraph 9 in each Schedule contains the relevant rules. A key feature was that the member would have been a full protection member of their earlier scheme if they had returned to service pensionable under that scheme on the date they re-joined (paragraph 9(1)(d)(i)). However, it was impossible for former full protection members of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 75, <abbr title="Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme">FTRS</abbr> 97 and <abbr title="Non-Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme">NRPS</abbr> 11 to meet this condition, because it was not possible for them to regain full protection in those schemes once they left service in them.</p>

<p>The draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> amend paragraph 9 in each Transitional Schedule to ensure that the MOD’s policy intent is achieved. The amendments will ensure that former full protection members of these three schemes will not be disqualified from full protection status in either the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 05 (regular service) or the <abbr title="Reserve Forces Pension Scheme">RFPS</abbr> 05 (reserve service) simply because they could not return to full protection membership in their original legacy scheme. These amendments will be retrospective in effect, back to 1 April 2015.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.14 </span>	Amendments to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15: Minor, Consequential, and Retrospective</h3>

<p>Minor amendments are required to the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 to ensure that it works smoothly with the amended legacy transitional rules to allow members who transition on 1 April 2022 to accrue pension in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15.</p>

<p>Amendments are made to the definition of transition member, and a new definition of transition date is inserted. Regulation 22, which defines qualifying service for the purposes of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15, is amended, in relation to a transition member with continuity of service, to replace a reference to a specific date (31 March 2015) with a reference to the member’s transition date.</p>

<p>Regulation 16 of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 sets out who is eligible for membership of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15. It was possible to opt out of membership of the legacy pension schemes and MOD’s policy in 2015 was that only those individuals who were active members of a legacy pension scheme would become members of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 automatically. Provision is made in the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 for members to opt into that scheme should they wish to do so, but policy intent was that the rules would not pre-empt that choice for transition members.</p>

<p>A retrospective amendment is made in these <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> to make this policy explicit on the face of the rules. This clarifies that where a member had opted out of membership in a legacy scheme, this opt out remains in force when they enter service which could be eligible for membership of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15. The member is at liberty to opt into the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 at any time<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. This provision will have retrospective effect back to 1 April 2015.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>	Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Government believes that the reformed pension schemes, including <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15, offer appropriate and generous pension provision for members, whilst also offering protection for the taxpayer against unsustainable costs. They are among the best available in the workplace: backed by the taxpayer, index-linked and offer guaranteed benefits on retirement. The rationale for the reforms still stands and it is therefore right that anyone who remains in service from 1 April 2022 will do so as a member of the reformed <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15. This will ensure fair treatment for all.</p>

<p>Implementation of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> is subject to passage of the Bill. It is expected that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pensions-and-compensation-for-veterans#mccloud-update">regulations</a> will be laid in March 2022, subject to this consultation, and come into force 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The pension scheme administrator (Defence Business Services) will write to all members who are in legacy pension schemes to advise them of the changes to pension arrangements from 1 April 2022 and the MOD will issue workforce communications to update on changes and provide more detailed policy guidance. No action needs to be taken by individuals. Changes to pension arrangements will be made automatically.</p>
