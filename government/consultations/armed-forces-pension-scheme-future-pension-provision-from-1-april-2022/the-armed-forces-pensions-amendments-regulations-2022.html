<p>47A.—(1) This paragraph applies to a transition member with continuity of service if on their transition date they are in qualifying service in accordance with rule A.7(1)(b) (qualifying service) of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 2005.</p>

<p>(2) For rule C.6 (purchase of added years for members seconded to NATO or the UN etc), substitute:</p>

<p>(2) If at the end of that period the member resumes service in the armed forces in which he is an active member of the Scheme, he may opt to make a single lump sum contribution to the Scheme to increase his reckonable service by an additional period equal to the length of his secondment before his transition date.</p>

<p>the member is entitled to count the period of his secondment before his transition date as reckonable service.</p>

<p>(5) If the aggregate amount mentioned in paragraph (4) is less than the amount determined by the Scheme actuary to be the amount required to be paid in order to increase the member’s reckonable service by the period of his secondment before his transition date, the Secretary of State must make a contribution to the Scheme equal to the difference.</p>

<p>(6) An option under this rule can only be exercised where the transition member also exercises an option under regulation 97 of the <abbr title="Armed Forces Pension Schemes">AFPS</abbr> 15 in respect of the period of their secondment after their transition date.”.</p>
