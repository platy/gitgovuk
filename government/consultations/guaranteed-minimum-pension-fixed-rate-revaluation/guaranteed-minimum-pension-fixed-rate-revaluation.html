<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This consultation seeks views on the proposed move from 3.5% per annum (<abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr>) to 3.25% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr> in the rate of revaluation applied to fixed rate revaluation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (<abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr>) for early leavers. The proposed new rate, subject to consultation responses, would apply to contracted-out members who leave pensionable service in the period 6 April 2022 to 5 April 2027.</p>

<h3>About this consultation</h3>

<h4>Who this consultation is aimed at</h4>

<p>This consultation is mainly aimed at pension administrators and employers who sponsor formerly contracted-out defined benefit occupational pension schemes. However, the government also welcomes comments from pension industry professionals, pension schemes, trustees, pension scheme members and member representative organisations and any other interested parties.</p>

<h4>Purpose of the consultation</h4>

<p>The aim of this consultation is to draw interested parties’ attention to and seek views on the proposed change to the rate of fixed rate revaluation for <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMPs</abbr> for early leavers. The change of rate is expected to come into force on 6 April 2022.</p>

<h4>Scope of consultation</h4>

<p>This consultation applies to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Occupational pensions policy is a reserved matter for Great Britain and is a devolved matter for Northern Ireland. It is anticipated that Northern Ireland will make corresponding changes.</p>

<h4>Duration of the consultation</h4>

<p>The consultation period begins on 23 September 2021 and runs until 18 November 2021. This represents an appropriate timespan due to the targeted nature of the questions being asked. Please ensure your response reaches us by that date as any replies received after that date may not be taken into account.</p>

<h4>Government response</h4>

<p>We will publish the government response to the consultation on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> website.

It will also include the draft regulations bringing the amended rate into effect.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Review of Guaranteed Minimum Pension Fixed Rate Revaluation for early leavers</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Between 6 April 1978 and 5 April 1997, employers sponsoring salary-related occupational pension schemes could ‘contract out’ their employees from the state additional pension through membership of the employer’s scheme, provided the scheme took on the responsibility for paying a Guaranteed Minimum Pension, from age 60 for a woman or 65 for a man. On reaching this age, members would generally have built up a Guaranteed Minimum Pension of a broadly similar amount to the state additional pension to which they would otherwise have been entitled, had they stayed in the State system.</p>

<p>Where a member of a formerly contracted out pension scheme leaves the scheme before pensionable age (an “early leaver”), the scheme must revalue their <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> until it becomes payable at pensionable age. Where a scheme has chosen to revalue the <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMPs</abbr> of early leavers using the “fixed rate method”, the <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> is revalued each year by the same percentage. The percentage is provided for in legislation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> by the rate relevant to the time they left the scheme.</p>

<p>The revaluation rate is reviewed every 5 years and a new rate needs to be applied for those who leave pensionable service on or after 6 April 2022. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has always undertaken this review having taken the advice of the Government Actuary’s Department (<abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr>) on the rate that should apply. <abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr> has prepared the report at Annex A.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Proposed Rate of Revaluation for Guaranteed Minimum Pensions with a Fixed Rate Revaluation</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> are proposing to apply a new fixed rate of revaluation for early leavers of 3.25% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr> from 6 April 2022.</p>

<p>In their report, <abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr> recommend a rate ranged between 3% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr> and 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr>, based on a short to medium term view on earnings assumptions being applied, given that most individuals leaving pensionable service between 6 April 2022 and 5 April 2027 (when the next review takes place) will be less than 10 years from the age at which <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMPs</abbr> are payable.</p>

<p>The proposed rate does not include an additional premium of 0.5% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr> for the certainty that employers get from revaluing in line with a fixed rate. The rationale for not including the premium is unchanged from the approach adopted to set the fixed revaluation rate in 2017 in that the nature of the relationship between schemes and the State has fundamentally changed since the introduction of the single-tier pension. Also given the shortened timescales there is less uncertainty around the increases in earnings for the members in question compared to looking over the longer term. We agree with <abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr>’s analysis, and suggest that it would be appropriate to take the middle point of their proposed rate range.</p>

<p>The current fixed rate of revaluation for <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMPs</abbr> is 3.5%<abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr>. Our proposed new rate therefore represents a small reduction in the increases members will see on their <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMPs</abbr> if these are uprated according to the fixed rate. Conversely, schemes which revalue <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMPs</abbr> based on the fixed rate will see a slight decrease in projected <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> costs.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Consultation questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Do you agree with a proposed rate of 3.25% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr>, to be applied from 6 April 2022?</li>

  <li>Do you agree that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> should continue to exclude the additional premium for fixing the revaluation rate of 0.5% <abbr title="per annum">pa</abbr>?</li>
