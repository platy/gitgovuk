<p>At Government Actuary’s Department (<abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr>), we seek to achieve a high standard in all our work. We are accredited under the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries’ Quality Assurance Scheme. Our website describes the standards we apply.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>1.1. The <abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr> has been asked by the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) for advice on the fixed rate of revaluation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (<abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr>) for contracted-out members who leave pensionable service in the period 6 April 2022 to 5 April 2027.</p>

<p>1.2. Schemes have been able to choose between 2 approaches for the revaluation of <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr> in this situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in line with increases in average earnings (as specified in annual orders), or</li>
  <li>in line with a fixed rate (as specified in orders which apply usually for leavers in specified 5-year periods)</li>
</ul>

<p>1.3. This paper deals with the rate to be determined under the second bullet point above.</p>

<p>1.4. In the past, fixed rate <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> revaluation has generally been reviewed every 5 years:</p>

<p>1.5. In <abbr title="Government Actuary’s Department">GAD</abbr>’s last review<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> we proposed a rate of either 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> allowing only for the growth in average earnings, or 4% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> including a 0.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> premium to allow for the conversion of a variable rate of revaluation (linked to actual average earnings growth) to a fixed rate.</p>

<p>1.6. Around the time of our last review in 2016, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) carried out some analysis indicating the average age of individuals with an open contracted-out Defined Benefit entry with a start date before 6 April 1997 (the date at which <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> accrual ceased) was around 53 years old. Furthermore, given <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr> ceased to accrue in 1997, the youngest members with <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr> are likely to be in their mid-40s. We have therefore concluded it was reasonable to move from a long-term view of inflation to a medium-term view, which at that time we considered to be around 10 years.</p>

<p>1.7. We arrived at the earnings assumption of 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> by determining an estimate of Consumer Price Index (<abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr>) inflation and allowing for our expectations of earnings relative to <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr>. We initially looked at market implied break-even Retail Price Index (<abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr>) and adjusted this for an inflation risk premium of 0.25% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> We then used the <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> assumption to set our <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> estimate allowing for our best estimate of the long-term difference between <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> and <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> of 1.15% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> as detailed in the table below. We then assumed earnings to increase on average at 2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> above <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation. The derived assumption was consistent with the Office for Budget Responsibility (<abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr>) short to medium term earnings assumption of 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> in place from April 2017.</p>

<p>1.8. When setting the fixed rate <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> revaluation in the past an additional 0.5% pa premium was added to the assumed level of earnings increases. This premium represented the price to exchange a variable rate of revaluation for a fixed rate. Following responses to the consultation issued in October 2016, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decided that circumstances had changed sufficiently so as not to include the 0.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> premium referred to above and opted for a fixed rate <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> revaluation of 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> based only on the earnings increase assumption<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Other relevant factors relating to this review</h3>

<p>1.9. In November 2020 the UK Statistics Authority and <abbr title="Her Majesty's">HM</abbr> Treasury published their joint response to the consultation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> on the potential reform of <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr>. This confirmed that the methodology for calculating <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> will be aligned with that for CPIH in February 2030.</p>

<p>1.10. The announcement of changes to the future of the <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> index has made it more difficult to derive a best estimate <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> assumption from market implied inflation, suggesting this is perhaps a less reliable indicator for future <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> inflation. In view of this we now consider it to be more appropriate to set the proposed inflation assumption relative to the Bank of England target and <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr> forecasts, rather than relying primarily on market implied inflation.</p>

<p>1.11. As defined benefit pension schemes mature and the proportion of members with <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr> reduces, and given that active members with <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr> are now much closer to the age at which they will receive their <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> than at the last review 5 years ago, the impact of the choice of fixed rate revaluation has even less of an impact on the finances of the scheme. To reflect the maturing <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pensions">GMPs</abbr>, we now intend to look at market implied inflation over a period of 7.5 years compared to the 10 years used at the previous review.</p>

<h2>Revaluation</h2>

<p>1.12. To determine the average earnings increase we first derive a <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation assumption and then add on a fixed margin to reflect how we expect earnings to increase in real terms relative to <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation over the relevant period. The methodology we used to derive these assumptions is discussed below.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> Inflation</h3>

<p>1.13. The Bank of England long term target<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> for <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> is 2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> This is also consistent with the <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr>’s medium-term forecast for <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr>. However, the Monetary Policy Summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> published by the Bank of England in June 2021 stated that “<abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation is expected to pick up further above the target, owing primarily to developments in energy and other commodity prices, and is likely to exceed 3% for a temporary period.” The statement goes on to say “More generally, the Committee’s central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back.” Given that we are looking at a term of 7.5 years it seems reasonable to make some allowance for <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> being higher than the 2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> target over the short term.</p>

<p>1.14. Current Bank of England inflation curves suggest the market expects <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> to be around 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> on average over the next 7.5 years. Assuming an <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr>-<abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> gap before 2030 of 1% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> would imply an inflation risk premium of around 0.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> assuming <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> of 2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> In the last review we allowed for an inflation risk premium of 0.25%. Therefore, an inflation risk premium of 0.25% to 0.5% pa would seem reasonable given the uncertainty of the impact of the announcement of the changes to <abbr title="Retail Price Index">RPI</abbr> and the uncertainty over future price inflation as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>1.15. Based on the above, a <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> assumption in the range of 2% to 2.25% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> over the next 7.5 years seems reasonable.</p>

<h3>Gap between inflation and earnings</h3>

<p>1.16. Previously we considered the gap between inflation and earnings over the medium term. However, given that the period we are looking at is now likely to be less than 10 years we now place more relevance on the short-term outlook when setting this assumption.</p>

<p>1.17. <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr>’s medium-term earnings assumption applying from 2025 is 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>, which is 1.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> above its <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> assumption of 2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> In years 2022 to 2025, the earnings assumptions are around 1% lower, reflecting both a lower assumed <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> and a smaller gap between <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation and forecast earnings. Allowing for lower assumed gap between earnings and <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> over the next few years (an average of 0.7% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr>), an average gap of earnings over <abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> inflation of 1% to 1.25% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> might be considered more appropriate (i.e. around 3% to 3.5% in total).</p>

<p>1.18. <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr> also produce a long-term earnings assumption, the latest long term assumption is 3.8% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. However, as noted, we are only considering medium time period of around 7.5 years. Together with analysis of <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>’s average weekly earnings data<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> over the last 10 years, which shows that the average annual earnings growth was around 2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> it seems more appropriate to adopt an assumption that more closely relates to <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr>’s short to medium-term assumptions.</p>

<p>1.19. Independent short-term forecasts<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> on earnings increases, published by HMT in May 2021, ranged from 2% to 5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> over the period from 2022 to 2025, with an average of 3.2% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr></p>

<p>1.20. There is still much uncertainty in respect of the impact of the COVID pandemic and the impact of furlough on average earnings increases. This is demonstrated by the independent forecasts ranging from 0.6% to 6.3% when forecasting increases for 2022. Private sector regular pay in the 3 months to April was 5.6% higher than a year earlier. The Bank of England note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">measured pay growth continues to be boosted by compositional effects, given that job losses have been skewed towards lower-paid employees during the pandemic. In addition, the base effect of the drop in pay in spring and summer 2020 will continue to distort the annual comparison, such that, even if the level of private sector regular pay were to remain unchanged in May and June, 12-month pay growth would still rise to close to 8% in the second quarter. Underlying pay growth appears to be around pre-COVID rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1.21. Given that this year’s increases in earnings have been distorted by the impact of the COVID pandemic and the furlough scheme, and the underlying pay growth appears to be around the pre-COVID rate, we think it reasonable to use the averages over the medium term as described above, without any explicit allowance for the higher pay increases reported over the last year. Taking the above into account we suggest an earnings increase assumption as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr></td>
      <td>2% to 2.25% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Earnings (<abbr title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</abbr> + 1% to 1.25% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr>)</td>
      <td>3% to 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Outcome of considerations</h3>

<p>1.22. In conclusion, we would propose an assumption for increases in average earnings for members with a <abbr title="Guaranteed Minimum Pension">GMP</abbr> who leave pensionable service in the period 2022 to 2027 of between 3% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> and 3.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> based on a short to medium term view for inflation and real earnings growth. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may wish to consider consulting on the range and arriving at a specific rate once responses have been received. However, if <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> prefer to consult on a specific rate then in our view 3.25% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> is reasonable and the mid-point of the range above.</p>

<p>1.23. We have assumed <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to exclude the additional premium of 0.5% <abbr title="per annum">p.a.</abbr> (as referred to above) which applied to the fixed revaluation rate prior to 2017. Our view is that excluding the premium remains appropriate based on the reasons set out in the March 2017 response, and that nothing has changed that would require a reintroduction of the premium compared to previously.</p>
