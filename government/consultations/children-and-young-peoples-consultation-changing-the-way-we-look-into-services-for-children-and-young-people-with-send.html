<p>There is also a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-new-approach-to-area-send-inspections">survey and more information for parents, carers and people who work with children and young people with SEND</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>Ofsted is best known for inspecting schools and colleges to make sure young people are getting the best possible education. You might have met an Ofsted inspector at your school or college.</p>

<p>We don’t just inspect schools and colleges. We also work with the Care Quality Commission to inspect local services for children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in the area where they live. This means we check the help that children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> get at school, from health services, or from support workers, to make sure it is good enough.</p>

<p>The Care Quality Commission is like Ofsted but looks at health services, like hospitals, rather than schools and colleges. It is usually called the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>What this consultation is all about</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqo430yVHbk" rel="external">Changing the way we look into services for children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>: BSL version</a></p>

<p>In 2014 the government made a law that said local services have to help children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>. This law had a list of things that local services must do.</p>

<p>Inspectors check that local services are doing everything that the law says they have to do. In 2016 we wrote an inspection framework that said how we would do these checks. The most important part of our checks was making sure that local services were obeying the law.</p>

<p>Now we want to check if the help that local services give to children and young people makes their lives better. We will still make sure local services obey the law. But we will look much more at how well they actually help people. We want to understand what it is like to be a child or young person with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> where you live.</p>

<p>These are the things we want to ask you about.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our inspectors want to check if the help that children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> get makes their lives better. We want to know what you think of that.</li>
  <li>We also want to know whether you agree with the things we think inspectors should look at .</li>
  <li>We want to make it easier for children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> to tell us what they think of the help they get. We have some ideas for this and we want to know what you think of them. We also want to know your ideas.</li>
</ol>

<h2>We need your help!</h2>

<p>We want to change the way we inspect local services for children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>. We want you to tell us whether you agree or disagree with these changes. Your answers will help us to decide what to do.</p>

<p>Please do a survey and tell us if you think that we are going to look at the right things.</p>

<p>Your parents or carers or your school or college can help you with the survey. They can [give us their views too at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-new-approach-to-area-send-inspections">‘Changing the way we look into services for children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>’</a>.</p>

<p>Please give us your answers by 11 September 2022.</p>
