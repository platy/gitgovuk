<p>The grant funding provided by the partnership has enabled the organisation to plan for the future with greater certainty.</p>

<p>In its first year as a strategic partner, the group, which owns and manages more than 23,000 homes across the Midlands and East of England, invested £81million to deliver 568 new homes and started work on a further 432. 
Rob Griffiths, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, said: “The strategic partnership has enabled us to plan our programme with greater certainty over a longer period.</p>

<p>“It has given us more freedom to work up new land-led opportunities for affordable homes, safe in the knowledge that the grant funding is in place. This is particularly important for more complex land-led schemes that take some time to get through planning and ultimately through to delivery.</p>

<p>“Becoming a strategic partner helped to shift our ambitions and increase our focus on land-led developments. While section 106 opportunities will still form part of our programme, we will now have a greater focus on our own, land-led schemes.”</p>

<p>The Group’s first scheme to be launched under the partnership is a development of more than 100 new affordable homes in Boston, Lincolnshire. Scheduled for completion in 2022, Heron Park will comprise 68 homes for Social Rent, with 20 one-bedroom houses, 20 two-bedroom properties and 28 three-bedroom homes.</p>

<p>A further 35 homes will be made available for Shared Ownership, with 13 two-bedroom houses and 22 three-bed properties.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the benefits offered by the partnership, Rob added: “It’s difficult to single out which benefits have had the biggest impact, but if I had to pick, I’d say the certainty it provides.</p>

<p>“Being a strategic partner has given us the freedom to progress new opportunities with the certainty of grant funding without having to get individual schemes approved.</p>

<p>“We’re now able to plan our future private financing requirements with the same degree of security over a longer period than we’ve had under previous grant regimes.</p>

<p>“Put simply, it means we can look to the future and what we plan to deliver with more confidence.”</p>

<p>On the joint partnership with NCHA, Rob said, “Our partnership with NCHA was key in enabling us to become a strategic partner. By combining our bid, we were able to scale up our delivery programme to the level needed while also managing the associated risk around a programme of this size.</p>

<p>“We’ve also been able to bring in delivery partners from across the Blue Skies Consortium – which we jointly lead with NCHA – sharing resources and expertise across our teams.”</p>
