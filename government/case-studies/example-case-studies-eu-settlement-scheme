  <li>works as a NHS nurse</li>
  <li>holds a permanent residence document</li>
</ul>

<p>Lordana works as a nurse and has lived in the UK for 8 years. She is eligible for settled status, subject to criminality and security checks. This means she can remain in the UK permanently. She has a valid permanent residence document.</p>

  <li>does not hold a permanent residence document</li>
</ul>

<p>Paul is eligible for pre-settled status if he applies, subject to criminality and security checks. This will give him 5 years’ leave to remain in the UK. He is not eligible for settled status because he did not live in the UK from 2013 to 2015.</p>
