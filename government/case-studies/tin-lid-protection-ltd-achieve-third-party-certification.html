<p>TLP Ltd have become the first commercial drone company specialising solely in security to be awarded with the Commissioner’s third party certification mark for their use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) surveillance cameras, after successfully completing the audit process with IQ Verify, one of the scheme’s approved and UKAS accredited certification bodies.</p>

<p>TLP Ltd are a commercial drone company specialising in security and public safety solutions, delivering 3 core services, ‘Drone Security Support’, ‘Drone Security Threat Assessments’, and ‘Counter Drone Defence Mapping’. Working with security companies, enforcement agencies, and end-user clients, these 3 core services are delivered across the UK from their base in Wiltshire.</p>

<h2>Third party certification</h2>

<p>Third party certification is a scheme that enables any organisation that operates a surveillance camera system, including CCTV, Body Worn Video, Drones, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Automatic Facial Recognition (AFR) within a public space, to show that they do so in  compliance with the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/282774/SurveillanceCameraCodePractice.pdf" class="govuk-link">Surveillance Camera Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<h2>The importance of applying for certification for TLP Ltd</h2>

<p>Chris Flannagan, CEO of TLP Ltd, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We applied for certification because we wanted to demonstrate to our clients and the public, that our internal policies and procedures for the collection, management, and retention of visual and audio data, has been independently audited against a set of regulated standards.</p>

  <p class="last-child">SCC Certification is a voluntary process, and this was an important factor for TLP Ltd as we can demonstrate to our clients and members of the public, that our commitment to their privacy and trepidation about the commercial drone industry, is taken very seriously. TLP Ltd already took these concerns seriously and had robust internal policies to manage these concerns. Voluntary SCC Certification elevates these robust internal policies to a level where people can have confidence in TLP Ltd drone operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The benefits of certification</h2>

<p>TLP Ltd is the first commercial drone company specialising solely in security and public safety solutions to achieve SCC Certification. Chris Flannagan says the benefits of this to their company are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Being able to demonstrate accountability and transparency in our drone operations to our clients and members of the public, against a set of independently assessed standards which they can view, and if needed raise concerns about privacy both directly to the company and the Surveillance Camera Commissioner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The third party certification process</h2>

<p>Regarding how easy they found the process of becoming certified with the scheme, Chris said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being independently audited against the SCC standards is a rigorous process, assessing not only TLP Ltd policies and procedures but also previous drone deployments (flights).</p>

  <p class="last-child">We chose IQ Verify to assist the company in achieving SCC Certification, as TLP Ltd identified that SCC Certification was more than just the final audit day. The IQ Verify team assisted us in completing the SCC self-assessment tool kit, and provided constructive feedback on our policies, procedures, and governance, including areas of strength within that framework but also areas for improvement. This support over a four-week period from IQ Verify was key to achieving SCC Certification, as whilst the process was not easy due to the requirements of the SCC, it was a developmental process that ensured a successful outcome from the auditor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What the Commissioner has to say</h2>

<p>Fraser Sampson, appointed as the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner on 1 March, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I am delighted to announce that TLP Ltd have been awarded with my third party certification mark as it means they can visibly demonstrate to others that they are using their drones in line with the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice – in other words they are being used proportionately, effectively, transparently and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. I hope this will pave the way for other drone companies to achieve the same high standards.</p>
