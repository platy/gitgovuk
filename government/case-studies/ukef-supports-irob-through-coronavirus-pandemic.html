<p>Warwickshire-based iRob specialises in robotics and automation, providing a range of manufacturing services to large scale exporters in the automotive industry. The company turned to <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> after securing a high-value contract with Jaguar Land Rover to deliver new automated facilities for a range of new models.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s local export finance manager, Jane Cooper, worked with Barclays to put a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-working-capital-scheme-overview-and-how-to-apply">working capital facility</a> in place that would allow the company to buy materials and pay staff while retaining cash in the business. We were also able to help extend the payment deadline after COVID-19 disruptions led to factory shutdowns and inevitable changes to the project timelines.</p>

<p>Giles Oberheim, Managing Director of iRob, says the impact of the support has been transformational:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This support has been the difference in being able to deliver this project and not. We wouldn’t have been able to do this alone without the support of both <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> and Barclays.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Barclays and <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> worked tirelessly to get us going.  We fully intend to carry on expanding as a business and see <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> as a key part of our future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jane Cooper, Export Finance Manager for Birmingham, Coventry and Warwickshire, Leicestershire, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child"><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s mission is to ensure no viable UK export fails for lack of finance from the private sector. That mission remains the same in all economic climates. I urge every UK exporter who is concerned about their ability to continue trading overseas to look at how <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> can support them through the pandemic.</p>
