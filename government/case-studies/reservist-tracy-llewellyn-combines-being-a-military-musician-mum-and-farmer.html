<p>After joining her local Powys Cadet Force Band at the age of 13, Tracy went onto to serve in the regular army for 12 years as part of the Corps of Army Music before leaving to start her family.</p>

<p>Tracy said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I decided to become an Army reservist after completing 12-years regular service. I had decided to leave to have children and I now have a little girl and a little boy.</p>

  <p>For me it means that I can do all the three things that mean the most to me. Which is working on the farm, being a mum and being a military musician.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I really enjoyed my job as a regular musician but left to start a family. The reserves gives me the opportunity to get the same enjoyment on a part-time and flexible basis. I get to do the job that I love without the family sacrifices that being a regular would have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a member of the Regimental Band &amp; Drums of the Royal Welsh, Tracy plays with her fellow musicians at prestigious events and occasions across the UK and abroad.</p>

<p>She admits it is sometimes a juggle to balance family life and childcare with her musical reserve duties, but says the effort is always worthwhile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a chance to do something different and the opportunities are huge, with courses, adventure training and new skills that are invaluable to anyone wanting to challenge themselves.</p>

  <p>My time in the regulars and the reserves has taught me to be patient and robust when facing arduous activities, something which definitely has value when farming.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I love my role as a musician in the Royal Welsh Band, working with a great bunch of people who enjoy what they do. Being able to do this close to home, in the area I grew up, with the added flexibility that being a reserve provides is fantastic.</p>
