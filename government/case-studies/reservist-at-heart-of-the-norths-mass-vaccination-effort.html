<p>Pictured above at York’s newly operating vaccination centre, Reservist, Major Gerard Hardy (Royal Logistics Corps) has been mobilised in support of the national Covid-19 effort.</p>

<p>Major Hardy is currently lead military liaison officer for the vaccine taskforce in the region.  His team is delivering vital military support to underpin the roll-out of mass Covid-19 vaccinations by the NHS across the Yorkshire and the North East.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I head a team that includes 19 full-time regular British Army medics and our role is logistics planning and supporting the mobilisation of new sites as vaccination centres.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I’m the only Reservist on the team and one of my tasks is to deploy medics to plug any shortfalls the NHS may have in manpower. So, for example, we have a team doing Covid vaccinations in the North East and have been helping to prepare a site in York for the start of mass vaccinations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his civilian life, Gerard is a dad of two and the schools liaison manager for the RFCA for Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The country is facing a historic health challenge and so it’s been good that my role in the reserves has given me the opportunity to get involved and make a positive contribution.</p>
