<p>The determinants of people’s health and wellbeing are complex, including their genetics, access to and quality of health care. Mostly, they are due to the wider socio-economic and environmental determinants in which they live, work and play. Much of the systems, policies and investment actions determining the way the environment is planned, designed, used and managed are the responsibility of town planners and the statutory planning system.</p>

<p>Therefore, addressing these wider determinants requires not only the actions of public health professionals but also town planners working in public and private sectors, including local authorities. These actions are determined by regulatory and policy directives from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government" class="govuk-link">Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government</a>, primarily through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework" class="govuk-link">National Planning Policy Framework</a> (<abbr title="National Planning Policy Framework">NPPF</abbr>). The <abbr title="National Planning Policy Framework">NPPF</abbr> sets out planning’s role to promote healthy and safe communities by meeting local health needs and supporting delivery of health strategies, and which can be achieved by making the use of tools such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-impact-assessment-tools" class="govuk-link">health impact assessments</a> (<abbr title="health impact assessments">HIAs</abbr>). There is a need to demonstrate what competencies town planners need and how they may already be aligning with the Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework (<abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr>).</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>Town planners are required to meet certain competencies to qualify chartered membership of the <a rel="external" href="https://www.rtpi.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Royal Town Planning Institute</a> as the membership body responsible for maintaining professional standards. Though there are several routes to chartership, generally, all practitioners are required to use case studies to reflect on <a rel="external" href="https://www.rtpi.org.uk/membership/assessment-of-professional-competence/licentiate-apc/licentiate-apc-resource-centre-june-2019/" class="govuk-link">specified competencies</a> for awareness, understanding and application, as part of a membership assessment. The competencies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying and analysing issues</li>
  <li>gathering appropriate information</li>
  <li>identifying and assessing alternative courses of action</li>
  <li>initiating and implementing a course of action or dissemination of knowledge</li>
  <li>legal framework and politics in planning</li>
  <li>reflection and review</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain comparable <abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> competencies are utilised, for example by a local authority planning policy planner to gather local intelligence such as the health needs assessment as part of an <abbr title="health impact assessment">HIA</abbr> health impact assessment (<abbr title="health impact assessment">HIA</abbr>) and wider evidence base to support lead policy areas such as on healthy places. Based on Public Health England’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-impact-assessment-in-spatial-planning" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="health impact assessment">HIA</abbr> in Planning guide</a>, professionals can be expected to demonstrate relevant competencies including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> A1.5: collate and analyse data to produce intelligence that informs decision making, planning, implementation, performance monitoring and evaluation – this is relevant for devising strategy/briefs to identify, collate and analyse local health needs and other data to justify requirement for <abbr title="health impact assessments">HIAs</abbr> in planning applications</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> A2.2: advocate public health principles and action to protect and improve health and wellbeing – town planners demonstrate this competency when integrating wider determinants issues into a policy or justification text of a policy</li>
  <li>PHKSF A3.5: mitigate risks to the public’s health using different approaches such as legislation, licensing, policy, education, fiscal measures – town planners will explore different planning powers available to local authorities including the <abbr title="health impact assessment">HIA</abbr> to tackle unhealthy environments</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> A4.4: report and advise on the implications of the evidence base for the most effective practice and the delivery of value for money – part of the <abbr title="health impact assessment">HIA</abbr> is to recommend options and preferred policy and wording options based on the evidence collated</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> B4.2: operate within the decision making, administrative and reporting processes that support political and democratic systems – this was identified as a common competency as town planners will need to understand the local political context and direction underpinning the policy action</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> C2.3: facilitate dialogue with groups and communities to improve health literacy and reduce inequalities using a range of tools and technologies – town planners will need to engage groups and gain consensus during the period of evidence gathering and advisory support</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a rel="external" href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390005905/Royal+Town+Planning+Institute+-+PHSKF.pdf/16b6e528-826a-1e04-306b-bb4f81bef500?t=1606307271189" class="govuk-link">high-level mapping exercise</a> was conducted to determine whether town planners’ competencies for the above example align with those of a public health professional as set out in the <abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr>. Although the competencies may be presented differently using respective jargon and terminology, the result shows alignment across all the competencies.</p>

<h2 id="the-outcome">The outcome</h2>

<p>Aligning competencies, using the <abbr title="Public Health Skills and Knowledge Framework">PHSKF</abbr> as the basis, opens up conversations with planners about their role and contribution to improving population health and wellbeing. Utilising specific tools available to planners in the planning system, such as <abbr title="health impact assessments">HIAs</abbr>, can help achieve local public health priorities. This is particularly relevant as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s-consultation-document" class="govuk-link">Prevention Green Paper</a> seeks to improve the coverage of <abbr title="health impact assessments">HIAs</abbr> in non-health settings.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>The development of Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) publications by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-healthy-places" class="govuk-link">Healthy Places team</a> and the Planning and Health programme has aimed to support getting public health research and evidence into planning practice, including the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-impact-assessment-in-spatial-planning" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="health impact assessment">HIA</abbr> in Planning guide</a>. By demonstrating that town planning and public health professionals share similar competencies, there is the opportunity for actions on wider determinants to be mainstreamed into non-health systems, such as town planning.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> Healthy Places team includes programmes on spatial planning, housing, transport, natural environment and nationally significant infrastructure projects. The team promotes collaborative working and knowledge-sharing and, as such, is willing to share detailed information of resources it has developed to support others.</p>
