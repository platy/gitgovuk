<h2>Denbigh Alliance</h2>

<p>The Denbigh Alliance is made up of two academies based in Milton Keynes. Pupils are aged between 11-19.
As part of a phased approach for a new build, the Trust was looking to buy both loose and fitted furniture.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the tender process had proved complicated and time consuming.</p>

<p>Having taken over as chief financial officer (CFO), Andy Squires went directly to the find a framework service on GOV.UK to source the next round of procurement. There were time constraints as work had to be completed within the Easter break and COVID-19 restrictions were a consideration.</p>

<p>Andy spoke to Leanne, the DfE furniture framework category manager, who provided advice and guidance, costs on loose furniture and details of the suppliers on the framework. Leanne also provided a comparison based on the specification Andy provided and details of what was and was not included in the framework.</p>

<p>On receipt of the five tenders, Andy went through the scoring process and settled on a preferred supplier. He then worked with Leanne on the contract template and a summary document to be shared with the other supplier tenders, explaining where he felt they hadn’t met the requirements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“It was a godsend to be able to speak to Leanne and put together a recommendation to go to the Board of Trustees with the confidence that DfE were the guardians. The framework offered value for money and a cost-effective process.”</p>

<p>Andy Squires, CFO, Denbigh Alliance</p>
</div>

<p>Based on Phase 1, costs were expected to be around £150k for Phase 2 and 3, but the contract value was actually £110k – a saving of £40k to invest in other areas. There was valuable time saved from the support Leanne provided throughout the process.</p>

<p>Sustainability was also an important factor when considering this tender exercise, so assistance was provided on environmental and social value content. This included furniture made, or part-made, from recycled materials, or refurbished. Consideration was also given to packaging and a sustainable transport plan, for example use of electric delivery vehicles, optimisation of software for delivery routes to reduce fuel consumption and looking at goods manufactured within the UK.&nbsp;This aspect of the procurement was used to support the school curriculum, involving pupils and increasing their knowledge and awareness of sustainability through efficiencies in the new school.</p>

<h2>Hope Academy</h2>

<p>Hope Academy in Merseyside caters for secondary education with pupils aged between 11 to 18.</p>

<p>The school was built around 2011 and was at the point where the furniture needed replacing. COVID-19 had also brought about changes in how/where the pupils ate, resulting in a need for additional furniture.</p>

<p>After attending the Schools Commercial Team webinar about the DfE furniture framework, the academy CFO looked into the details for their school requirements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“It was impressive because I didn’t have do anything. I sent Leanne details of what we wanted, and she got four quotes for us.”</p>

<p>Stephen Hughes, chief financial officer, Hope Academy</p>
</div>

<p>Stephen was pleased with the time it saved him.  All requirements were discussed with the chosen supplier and the school saved around £4,000 which will be reinvested to buy new chairs.</p>
