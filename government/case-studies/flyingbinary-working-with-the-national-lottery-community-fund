<p>Very easy. It works as well for the supplier and the buyer.</p>

<p>We always refresh our G-Cloud services for each G-Cloud Framework submission, upgrading services based on buyer requests or feedback. We have added additional services for every G-Cloud iteration. G-Cloud 10 has solved one of the biggest problems we have, we were able to copy our G-Cloud 9 services to the G-Cloud 10 submission, a huge saving in time for us</p>

<h2 id="customers-testimonial">Customer’s testimonial</h2>

<p>“G-Cloud 10 was an incredibly simple and efficient way for the Big Lottery Fund to procure a credible organisation capable of delivering our ABS data dashboard.  The data dashboard will allow the five A Better Start partnerships to compare their performance with other partnerships enabling them to share learning and knowledge more effectively. The data from the five partnerships will be aggregated up to provide a programme level dashboard which will support the partnerships and The Fund in informing national as well as local policy. The common data set and dashboard will support the partnerships to deliver their agreed outcomes, most notably their ability to affect a systems change through evidence based practice.”</p>
