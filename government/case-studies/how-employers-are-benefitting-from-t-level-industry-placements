<p>As part of the government’s ‘Plan for Jobs’, there are a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-for-jobs-skills-and-employment-programmes-information-for-employers?utm_source=ApprenticeshipsCaseStudy&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=PFJ#industry-placements-t-levels" class="govuk-link">range of government programmes available for employers, including apprenticeships</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>T Levels are a new, 2-year qualification for 16 to 19 year olds. Designed with employers, each T Level is equivalent to 3 A levels and helps young people develop the knowledge, attitude and practical skills to thrive in the workplace.</p>

<p>At the heart of each course is a 45-day industry placement, that will give you early access to the brightest talent entering your market.</p>

<h2 id="yeovil-district-hospital-nhs-foundation-trust-ydh">Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (YDH)</h2>

<p>YDH provides acute care for a population of around 180,000 in South Somerset, North and West Dorset, and parts of Mendip. As one of the largest employers in the area, the trust recognised its responsibility to invest in young people and raise awareness of T Level opportunities available in the health and care sector.</p>

<p>Working in partnership with Yeovil College YDH has piloted industry placements with BTEC health and care students, creating placements in maintenance and administration, and with porters and ward clerks. They have also agreed a placement plan for allied health professions and healthcare science.</p>

<p>Some of the students that have undertaken placements are now employed on the trust bank while still attending college. YDH is looking into the possibility of them being able to access substantive positions after completing their studies in transition rather than an application process, in recognition of the student’s contributions to the trust and to support their ongoing learning.</p>

<p>Eight students that were on industry placements also supported the trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. These students contributed by either working on the trust bank or as volunteers in the organisation. This experience has further strengthened their desire to work in the NHS.</p>

<h2 id="royal-albert-memorial-museum">Royal Albert Memorial Museum</h2>

<p>Exeter’s world-class Royal Albert Memorial Museum has stunning displays and galleries, exhibitions and modern amenities, with displays revealing Devon and Exeter’s rich history and global connections.</p>

<p>Keen to work with students, and to extend opportunities to young people from a range of backgrounds – whilst developing projects to benefit the museum – they hosted industry placements with a design assistant and digital assistant.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/386518990" class="govuk-link">This film explains how they designed and delivered the placements</a>, and explains the benefits to both the organisation and student.</p>
