<p>As required by legislation, GAD reports annually on the effect of the April up-ratings, and every 5 years we undertake a long-term review of the Fund. This year we have produced both the annual Up-rating report and long-term Quinquennial Review of the NIF.</p>

<h2>Up-rating report</h2>
<p>The annual Up-rating Report published in January 2022, projected contribution income, benefit payments and the balance of the NIF over the next 5 financial years. Contribution income and benefit payments are currently around £120 billion each year.</p>

<p>The Up-rating report showed the NIF is projected to be in surplus in each of next 5 years, although that surplus will generally decrease each year. These figures mean that it’s not anticipated there will be any payment required to the NIF from HM Treasury over the next 5 years.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Businesswoman Looking at Dashboard on Screen" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/149361/Businesswoman_Looking_at_Analytics_960x640.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>Quinquennial Review</h2>
<p>The Up-rating Report was complemented by the Quinquennial Review. We undertake this detailed review every 5 years and examine factors such as changes in the age structure of the UK population and changes in state pension age. This in-depth report has a 65-year projection.</p>

<p>The Quinquennial Review looked at the long-term relationship between benefit payments (mainly state pensions) and contribution income (mainly national insurance contributions) and projected these for each year to 2086.</p>

<p>GAD used a project management framework that incorporated the annual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1047413/E02705826_Un_Act_GAD_NIF_Uprating_Report_Jan22_Web_Accessible_-_UPLOADED_GOV_UK.pdf" rel="external">Up-rating report</a> and the Quinquennial Review as a single project. This led to delivery of this Review in our contemporary and accessible reporting style both efficiently and quickly.</p>
