<h2>Digital</h2>

<h3>Version 1</h3>

<p>IT professional services company Version 1 deliver a range of digital and transformation services to both UK public and private sectors.</p>

<p>With a commitment to support 16-24 year olds as part of their own ‘Community First’ strategy, Version 1 have also included a range of placement and careers development activities public sector contracts. As part of their IT contract with Harrow Council, Version 1 have supported a student from Harrow and Uxbridge College, studying the digital production, design, and development T Level, by hosting an industry placement.</p>

<p>During his 4-week on-site placement, the T Level student worked on a data centre migration project moving workloads from the council’s on-premises Data Centre into Microsoft Azure, as well as developing a governance app for the project using Microsoft Power Apps.</p>

<h4>Jude McVitty, Social Value Manager, Version 1 said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version 1 is passionate about our social commitment to the employability of young people into our industry. We are excited to be able to work with the local college and the Local Authority in partnership to facilitate this – and other future - T Level industry placements that we hope will lead to a successful career in the digital sector. The industry placement supported a local employer; and the student gained experience in the workplace, whilst developing their skills and knowledge of IT.</p>

  <p class="last-child">As we work with a range of public and private sector organisations, we will realise more opportunities to support learners on a range of courses to gain the work experience they need. This benefits the students, our customers, our organisation and our industry; a perfect platform for success.</p>

<h2>Education and Childcare</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="The logo of Bramble School." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/132813/eac18e94-2aa9-4ff6-81cf-94e77420a330.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Bramble Infant School and Nursey host T Level students on industry placement</h3>

<p>Bramble Infant School and Nursery in Portsmouth provides for 343 children, aged from 6 months to 7 years old. With the school values of Succeed, Think, Aspire &amp; Respect, they are as committed to their staff, as they are to their pupils.</p>

<p>Determined to support the future generation of nursery practitioners, teachers and teaching assistants, the school hosted T Level industry placements last year for two students from Havant &amp; South Downs College. Both education and childcare T Level students are returning to the setting in September, with one student continuing to gain further industry experience in the nursery, whilst the other is taking time to work with older children in school.</p>

<p>Whilst on industry placement students shadow a staff member, and pick up the routine to understand what nursery would consider a typical day. Students learn and understand the type of activities nursery provides for children and why they do so and are encouraged to create their own activities for children. This brings many benefits to the school, as they learn from students themselves and the skills they bring with them.</p>

<p>Child development is an important element for students to understand and at Bramble Infant School and Nursey and T Level students have the opportunity to gain further experience of child development, teaching and learning by joining the staff team on completion of their course.</p>

<h4>Sharon Widnell Deputy Nursery manager, Bramble Infant School and Nursery said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, staff model to our students what constitutes a good work ethic. Students need time and support to build upon their skills. The block week placement in our setting allows students to experience the working world, with a safety net and help them to understand the expectations of employers.</p>

  <p>Like the children we care for, students can take small steps to achieve their goals. Every good practitioner started as a student and we understand the importance of our professional development.</p>

  <p class="last-child">T Levels are a fantastic way to ensure students get the right mix of classroom based knowledge and a real taste of the workplace. We will assist any student who wants to achieve a career in childcare.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<h3>VINCI Construction UK supporting technical education</h3>

<p>VINCI Construction UK is part of the VINCI Group - a world leader in concessions, construction and energy.</p>

<p>VINCI Construction UK has 4 main divisions, including Building Division (handling the construction, conversion or refurbishment of developments), Taylor Woodrow (civil engineering), VINCI Facilities (providing bespoke solutions within the built environment) and VINCI Technology Centre UK (combining laboratory testing with expertise in sustainability) VINCI Construction UK has around 3600 employees, and as an employer, they support technical education programmes, including T Level industry placements and apprenticeships.</p>

<p>VINCI Construction UK supports T Levels with students completing a period of work experience – enabling students to complete their studies whilst gaining experience of life in the construction industry.  Offering industry placements has brought many benefits to the business. In the main, T Levels are supporting the VINCI Construction UK talent pipeline. Industry placements have the opportunity to progress onto apprenticeship programmes, and the employer is benefitting from being able to see individuals in the work environment before they commit to offering an apprenticeship to students.</p>

<p>The company’s first two T Level students are currently undertaking placements in the North East, on site on a York based project. These students are studying T-Level in Construction at York College and are undertaking various engineering tasks including setting out, surveying, quality control, work planning and general contributions to the site such as safety management.</p>

<h4>Michelle Curzon, Academy Manager, VINCI Construction UK Ltd said:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technical education opportunities within VINCI Construction UK include our business hosting T Level industry placements and taking on apprentices.</p>

  <p>“Both options provide our business with the skills we need, whilst enabling T Level students and apprentices to progress in their careers. T Levels are one route to an apprenticeship within our business, and many apprentices remain with us on completion of their programme; going on to carve successful careers in construction.</p>

  <p class="last-child">The introduction of incentive payments for employers for both T Levels and apprenticeships means we can continue to support students on both programmes – with incentive payments enabling our business to offer the best training and support possible.</p>
