<p>It is almost 40 years since the ship Alasdair Gilchrist was aboard sank after being hit by an anti-ship missile during the Falklands conflict.</p>

<p>Four decades on he brings his experience and expertise to bear at the Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (<abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr>) by making the lives of those serving at sea safer.</p>

<p>As Above Water Systems Programme Manager he has pioneered work in artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) and machine learning, autonomy in uncrewed vessels, and threat detection.</p>

<p>Alasdair, who has been made an <abbr title="Member of the Order of the British Empire">MBE</abbr>, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I survived HMS Sheffield sinking on the 4th of May 1982.  It was quite personal. I lost 20 good friends and had some mental issues after that – post traumatic stress.</p>

  <p>To come through that you need to be able to use it as a positive emotion to affect change for good. Saving sailors’ lives is what we do and I’m very proud of that.</p>

  <p class="last-child">I want to make a difference and <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> has given me that platform to make a difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/3FQAkkfkko0" rel="external">The People Inside: Alisdair Gilchrist</a></p>

<p>Alasdair joined the Royal Navy 45 years ago and was tasked with the most menial jobs on the ship but now he is helping shape the future of naval warfare.</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">I joined the Navy in 1977 as a young junior seaman operator – mainly scrubbing decks and cleaning toilets at the age of 16, but learning from the bottom up which was just a wonderful experience. They sent me around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He served with the Royal Navy for 28 years. He has worked at <abbr title="Defence Science and Technology Laboratory">Dstl</abbr> more than 16 years and recently been involved in projects such as the uncrewed vessel <abbr title="Maritime Autonomy Surface Testbed 13">MAST-13</abbr> and exercise Formidable Shield.</p>

<p>Alasdair – who is known as Gilly - said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My role is predominantly looking after the science and technology advancement of the Royal Navy’s technical goals on its major warships.</p>

  <p>The exciting thing is to see the technology go on to the ships. We just can’t sit on our laurels.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Technology is going at a pace and we just have to keep up with it – and shape it for good.</p>
