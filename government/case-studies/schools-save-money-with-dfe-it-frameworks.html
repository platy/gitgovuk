<h2>Brigantia Learning Trust</h2>

<p>There are currently 5 academies within the trust which caters for children aged between 2 and 19.</p>

<p>Simeon Cornelius, senior operations officer of Brigantia Learning Trust, was considering a cloud-based management information system (MIS) to manage the services needed across the Trust. This was not available with the current supplier.</p>

<p>The Trust used the Crown Commercial Service framework website to go through the procurement process and write the specification. Based on the requirements only one supplier was needed, and a contract was awarded for 2 years, with an option to extend for a year.</p>

<p>The Trust was paying around £110k a year for their service. The new contract value is approximately £50k a year, delivering a significant saving. There is an implementation cost, which the trust expects to recover within 2yrs. For example in one academy alone the new IT system reduces running costs from £50k to £16k per year.</p>

<p>The Trust found the procurement process simple and straightforward. Time was saved using the quick and easy tender process.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The process was frighteningly simple compared to others.”</p>

<p>Simeon Cornelius, senior operations officer, Brigantia Learning Trust</p>

<p>The new service will result in the IT technical resource being able to focus on their job and there will be significant time saved from having a group wide information system.</p>

<h2>The Sea View Trust</h2>

<p>Nicola Chester, chief operating officer at The Sea View Trust, was keen to improve efficiency by moving to a single, cloud-based MIS.</p>

<p>She utilised DfE’s G-Cloud 12 framework and, having reviewed demonstrations and quotes from two suppliers, made an informed decision to secure a new contract.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The framework was almost too easy; I kept doubting myself. I was confident as all compliance checks had been done.”</p>

</div>

<p>The annual cost is around the same as the previous contract and includes the initial set-up cost of £10k. The benefits are an improved upgraded system that includes all the schools across the Trust. Time savings for gathering information will be significant as everything is now stored in one place and will not require telephone calls to each school.</p>

<p>The Trust felt that the framework was quick and easy to use and have confidence that the contract is compliant.</p>

<h2>Maritime Academy Trust</h2>

<p>The chief operating officer (COO) at the Trust was keen to ensure that the IT systems were updated and after checking the ‘Buying for schools’ guide on GOV.UK, contacted Everything ICT to request an independent audit.</p>

<p>Everything ICT reviewed the needs of each school and then went out to tender. They managed the whole process start-to-finish, adding value and challenging some aspects to ensure the trust got what was needed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Because we have Everything ICT, we don’t currently need an IT Lead.”</p>

<p>Susan Matheson, COO, Maritime Academy Trust</p>
</div>

<p>The Trust felt that the procurement process went very smoothly. As a result of the support they received from Everything ICT they now have a robust IT system using Google which allows very effective collaboration between schools, which wasn’t possible before.</p>

<p>Overall costs remained in line with earlier IT spend. However, the better system meant that all staff could easily move to working from home during the coronavirus COVID-19 restrictions. The Trust also now feels they have a strong IT maintenance contract across all schools ensuring the system is running effectively.</p>
