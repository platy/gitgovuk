<p>We worked with the Centre for Disaster Protection, to develop a model that simulates soil moisture in Malawi based on historic data. GAD’s model provided a methodology which can be adapted for simulating other drought measures in different countries.</p>

<h2>Drought indicators</h2>
<p>The Centre for Disaster Protection collaborated with the World Bank to examine various drought indicators and welfare measures.</p>

<p>They were looking to find a link between droughts and the impact on households, using historical weather event series as indicators of drought. GAD’s role was to develop a model to simulate the drought indicators.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Desert Drought" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/149353/Desert_Drought_960x640.jpg"></div></figure>

<h2>Data science</h2>
<p>GAD carried out a detailed exploration of historical data to ensure we understood the features and dynamics which we needed to capture in our modelling. We used this to develop a model which produced 10,000 simulations, over a 1-year time horizon of soil moisture at 5-kilometer points throughout Malawi.</p>

<p>We used data science techniques to build a model to reduce the dimensionality of the data and fit an appropriate time-series model. We then created simulated future projections of soil moisture for each of the data points.</p>

<p>Our analysts had to overcome the challenge of capturing the following behaviours of the underlying drought indicators:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>temporal</strong>: how to capture the seasonal trends and varying levels of soil moisture during the rainy and dry seasons</li>
  <li>
<strong>spatial</strong>: how to incorporate correlations between spatial points (where we had to look at the relationships between 32,000 data points)</li>
  <li>
<strong>scalability</strong>: how to make the model flexible and scalable so it can be applied to other countries and drought indicators</li>
</ul>

<p>It is hoped that our model could be used to improve how we plan for and take action to avoid or mitigate the impact of droughts in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
