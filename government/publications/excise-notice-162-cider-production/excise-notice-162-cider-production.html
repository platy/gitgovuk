<span class="number">1.1 </span> About this notice</h3>

<p>This notice explains the effects of the law and regulations covering the production, storage and accounting for duty on cider and perry.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Paragraphs containing legal force</h3>

<p>Sometimes the law says that detailed rules on a particular matter may be set out in a notice published by HMRC. <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-13">Paragraphs 5.13</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-6-2">6.2</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-6-3">6.3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-11-3">11.3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-11-8">11.8</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-11-12">11.12</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-13-7">13.7</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-13-8">13.8</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-13-13">13.13</a> have legal force and are indicated by being placed in a box.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The basics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> What cider is</h3>

<p>In the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979, ‘cider’ is defined as ‘cider or perry of a strength exceeding 1.2% alcohol by volume (<abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>) but less than 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> obtained from the fermentation of apple or pear juice without the addition at any time of any alcoholic liquor or of any liquor or substance which communicates colour or flavour other than the Commissioners may allow as appearing to them to be necessary to make cider or perry’ — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-5">paragraph 5.5</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-25">section 25</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the cider definition provides that ‘the pre-fermentation mixture satisfies the pre-fermentation requirement’ and the cider ‘satisfies the final product juice requirement’ — for further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-28">section 28</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> How the duty system works</h3>

<p>If you produce cider for sale you must be registered with us for duty purposes, unless you qualify for exemption — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-1">paragraphs 3.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-10">3.10</a>.</p>

<p>Cider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>becomes liable to duty when it is made (that is, when its strength exceeds 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>) or imported into the UK or moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-5">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>can be held on or, in certain circumstances, moved between registered premises or to excise warehouses in duty suspension — that is, without payment of duty but always remaining liable to duty</li>
</ul>

<p>Duty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is charged on the quantity and in bands determined by alcoholic strength — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-5">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>is normally calculated by reference to the quantity and alcoholic strength stated on the package label or invoice — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-8">sections 8</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-9">9</a>
</li>
  <li>becomes payable when cider is released from or consumed in registered premises or excise warehouses — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-5">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>may also be paid on the constructive removal of cider held in duty suspense on registered premises — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-13">paragraph 5.13</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> How to calculate the duty</h3>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep records of all cider produced</li>
  <li>keep records of all cider leaving registered premises, or otherwise passing the duty point — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-8">paragraphs 5.8</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-13">5.13</a>
</li>
  <li>calculate duty due on all cider released for home use — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-5">section 5</a>
</li>
  <li>keep records of all cider destroyed — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-11">sections 11</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-13">13</a>
</li>
  <li>complete a monthly duty return and send it to the TAPS and CCL Cumbernauld Accounting Team — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-7-11">paragraph 7.11</a>
</li>
  <li>pay the duty by the due date by one of the methods described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-7-10">paragraph 7.10</a>
</li>
  <li>keep a record of any excise duty off-set calculation you have made — see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>You must exercise control over your cider making activities. Unless exempt from the requirement to be registered (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-10">paragraph 3.10</a>) you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register your cider premises</li>
  <li>make entry of your cider premises</li>
  <li>maintain your business records to acceptable standards</li>
  <li>render returns as required and pay any duty owing no later than the due date</li>
  <li>comply with the requirements of this notice</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also register for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-alcohol-wholesaler-registration-scheme-awrs">Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme (<abbr title="Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme">AWRS</abbr>)</a> if you sell duty paid alcohol to another business. It’s the responsibility of any business who purchases alcohol for onward sale or supply to check that the wholesaler they purchase from has been approved by HMRC.</p>

<p>Therefore, from April 2017, any business purchasing cider for onward sale or supply from you should check that you’ve been approved as an alcohol wholesaler. To apply for approval, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-2002-alcohol-wholesaler-registration-scheme">Excise Notice 2002: Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>However, the <abbr title="Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme">AWRS</abbr> only applies to registered cider makers. If you’re a small cider maker and exempt from the requirements to register as a cider producer (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-10">paragraph 3.10</a>) and pay excise duty on what you produce, then you’re not required to be registered for <abbr title="Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme">AWRS</abbr>. Paragraph 5.1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-2002-alcohol-wholesaler-registration-scheme">Excise Notice 2002</a> explains further on why you would be outside the scope of <abbr title="Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme">AWRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Your customers may ask for evidence that you’re a small cider maker and therefore purchases made are not within the scope of the <abbr title="Alcohol Wholesaler Registration Scheme">AWRS</abbr>. An example of this evidence could be the acceptance letter we issue when a cider maker claims exemption from registration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-11">paragraph 3.11</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Visits by HMRC</h3>

<p>We’ll make visits to make sure duty is being correctly assessed and accounted for on all cider leaving registered premises. Assurance is based on auditing your commercial, accounting and management control systems and on physical checks. We’ll carry out physical checks on production, stock and movements of cider in duty suspension.</p>

<p>When we intend to carry out our checks, we’ll normally make a prior appointment. Occasionally, we may make visits without appointment, but the attending officer will give the reason for the unannounced visit. At any reasonable time, you must permit our officers access to any area of the registered premises. You must make sure that all your security personnel are aware that we may visit without appointment. All of our officers carry identification and will show this when they arrive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Failing to meet your legal obligations</h3>

<p>If you fail to comply with the law and regulations relating to this notice (<a class="govuk-link" href="#para-1-4">see paragraph 1.4</a>) or do not account for the correct amount of Excise Duty, we may take action including the issue of assessments and or civil penalties. These are explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/excise-assessments-interim-guidance">Excise Assessments Interim Guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-209-civil-penalties-fixed-geared-and-daily/excise-notice-209-civil-penalties-fixed-geared-and-daily">Notice 209: civil penalties: fixed, geared and daily</a>. You may also be liable to penalties if you fail to apply to register with HMRC at the right time or if your monthly duty return is inaccurate — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-14">paragraphs 3.14</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-7-7">7.7</a>. In many cases you’ll have the right to appeal. Full details of the appeals procedure are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-27">section 27</a> of this notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Registration</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Do I need to register</h3>

<p>Yes, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you make or propose to make cider for sale</li>
  <li>your total production — including cider for your own consumption — in any rolling period of 12 consecutive months either exceeds 70 hectolitres (7000 litres), or is likely to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also advise us if you render cider sparkling (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-5">section 5</a>), unless you intend to carry out this process in an excise warehouse. You may produce cider and render cider sparkling on the same registered premises.</p>

<h4>Changes in ownership</h4>

<p>Where an existing business (including all of its assets, liabilities and obligations) is sold to a new owner, the new owner must apply for registration prior to trading. The existing registration will not transfer to the new owner upon the sale of a business.</p>

<p>Upon the sale of the business, the new owner should apply at least 45 working days in advance of the date they intend to start trading. The new owner will not be able to trade until they have received confirmation from HMRC that their application has been successful. If they do so, they will be treated as trading without approval.</p>

<p>This only applies where there has been a complete change in ownership. Significant changes must still be notified to HMRC.</p>

<p>Examples of when a change of ownership takes place and a new application is required include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share sales — involving a complete transfer of shares of the business from the original owner to the new owner, including all assets, liabilities and obligations</li>
  <li>business sales involving a complete transfer of all assets, liabilities and obligations as part of the terms of the sale of the business</li>
</ul>

<p>A partial sale of shares or a business’s assets or liabilities, where an original owner remains in place may not require a new application, but any changes must still be notified to HMRC as set out in this section.</p>

<p>The above examples are not exhaustive. If you are unsure as to whether a new application is required, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">contact HMRC for clarification</a>.</p>

<p>The new owner should also ensure that any financial security required by HMRC from the business, such as a guarantee, is valid and in place when they take over the business. Guarantees held by the previous owner may not transfer to the new owner, who should seek clarification from HMRC and the guarantor, if necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> How to register</h3>

<p>To register simply complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-to-register-as-a-cider-or-perry-maker-cp30">Alcohol duties: apply to register as a cider or perry maker (CP30)</a>.</p>

<p>You can either submit the form online or fill in the form on-screen.</p>

<h4>Submitting the form online</h4>

<p>Submit the form online and send entry of your premises (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-4">paragraph 3.4</a>) as soon as possible by post to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HMRC
<br>Excise Processing Teams
<br>BX9 1GL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll get a reference number when you submit the form online which you should include with your entry of premises. You have 15 working days from when you submit your online application to send us the entry of premises. If you do not, we’ll be unable to proceed with your request, meaning you’ll have to resubmit it and this will be treated as a new application.</p>

<h4>Filling in the form on-screen</h4>

<p>Fill in the form on-screen, print and post it along with entry of your premises as soon as possible to the address above.</p>

<p>If you have an enquiry about your application once it has been sent, you may contact the Excise Processing Teams (<abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr>). For any enquiries before this stage, you should contact our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>A separate registration is required for each set of premises at which you intend to make cider. A certificate of registration will be issued in the name of the proper legal entity (for example, sole proprietor, partnership, limited company). However, you may choose to submit only one duty return for all registered premises owned by the same legal entity — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-7-6">paragraph 7.6</a>.</p>

<p>All cider makers applying for registration for the first time are required to arrange for a guarantee to cover any duty due on cider, removed from your registered premises to the UK home market, until it is paid to HMRC — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-4">section 4</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, it may take up to 45 days to process your application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> What registration allows you to do</h3>

<p>As a registered cider maker you’re allowed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>produce cider on your registered premises</li>
  <li>carry out all operations and procedures set out in this notice, including the removal of duty suspended product to other appropriately approved UK warehouses — for Northern Ireland based registered cider makers, you can also remove duty suspended products to appropriately approved EU warehouses</li>
  <li>store, in duty suspense, on your registered premises cider produced at those premises</li>
  <li>receive cider in duty suspense from other appropriately approved warehouses for further processing</li>
  <li>receive back your own product from other appropriately approved warehouses (that are, approved to receive cider) where it has undergone further processing, for example aeration, pasteurisation and bottling</li>
</ul>

<p>Registration does not allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receive cider, not previously produced on your registered premises, in a ready for sale state from other registered premises or approved warehouses</li>
  <li>receive spirits, wine or beer</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to receive spirits for fortification you must apply for approval as a Trade Facility Warehouse — see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196: excise goods — registration and approval of warehousekeepers, warehouse premises, owners of goods and registered consignors</a>. Note that the final product cannot be classed as cider for duty purposes — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-5">paragraph 5.5</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-163-wine-production/excise-notice-163-wine-production">Excise Notice 163: wine production</a>. Equally, any quantity of cider that may be found to have reached 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> or more cannot be classed as cider for duty purposes and must be dealt with under the terms of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-163-wine-production/excise-notice-163-wine-production">Excise Notice 163: wine production</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> How to ‘make entry of the premises’</h3>

<p>As part of your application for registration, you must make entry of the premises you intend to use.</p>

<p>An entry of premises is a plan showing the position and description of each vessel or other piece of plant you intend to use in the production of cider and where the cider is to be stored. It should include any identifying marks on your vessels or plant and the full address of the premises, and should be sent to the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> along with your application for registration. The plan must be A4 size or less and in black and white with duty suspended areas shaded accordingly.</p>

<p>You’re not required to make an Excise entry of your premises if the cider you produce is not for sale or if you’re exempt from registration — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-10">paragraph 3.10</a>.</p>

<p>Note: retail premises, within or attached to your registered premises, are not considered part of the registered premises. Any cider to the retail premises will have to be duty paid on removal from the registered premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Using your entered premises for other Excise trades</h3>

<p>You may use your premises for other Excise trades (for example, a compounder of spirits) provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re properly licensed or registered to carry out that trade</li>
  <li>you observe all the requirements set out in the appropriate notice and any additional restrictions or conditions imposed by us</li>
  <li>your working practices and records readily identify the particular trade being carried out in any room, vessel or piece of equipment that can be used for 2 or more trades</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Changes affecting your registration particulars</h3>

<p>You must write to the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-2">paragraph 3.2</a> for the address) giving details of any changes that may affect your registration, check <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-9">paragraph 3.9</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The following changes would require a new application and entry of premises to be submitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change of legal entity, for example, formation of a limited company</li>
  <li>change in the ownership or control of your business, check <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-1">paragraph 3.1</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It may take up to 45 working days to process your new application, so notify the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> of any changes as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The following other changes must also be notified in writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change to partner details</li>
  <li>change to director details</li>
  <li>change of address of your registered premises — entry of premises would also need to be submitted</li>
  <li>cessation of production</li>
  <li>the production of other excisable goods on your premises</li>
  <li>financial difficulties/impending insolvency</li>
  <li>you become VAT registered or deregistered</li>
</ul>

<p>It may take up to 15 working days to make changes to your current registration, so notify the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> of any changes as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> What happens after you’ve applied for registration</h3>

<p>Your application will be vetted and is subject to background checks. Should these checks provide insufficient assurance that the business is suitable for registration, further information may be requested. Until this information is received, your application will be put on hold. A visit to your place of business may also be required.</p>

<p>If we accept your application, we’ll issue you with a Certificate of Registration, which will confirm the date of registration plus details of any conditions that we have placed on your registration. You should keep the certificate on the premises to which it refers and make it available to our officers on request.</p>

<p>Note. Acceptance will register your premises as a tax warehouse but not as an excise warehouse. Information on excise warehouses can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196: excise goods — registration and approval of warehousekeepers, warehouse premises, owners of goods and registered consignors</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<p>If we refuse your application, we’ll inform you in writing and give our reason or reasons. We’ll offer you a review of our decision or you can appeal direct to the independent tribunal — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-27">section 27</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> How long your registration will last</h3>

<p>Registration will last until production has ceased. You must notify us in writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you intend to cease production</li>
  <li>when you’ve actually ceased production</li>
</ul>

<p>If you sell your business, your registration will not transfer to the new owner. Check <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-1">paragraph 3.1</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Ceasing production</h3>

<p>After production has stopped and your cider is finished and packaged (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-21-3">paragraph 21.3</a>) you’ll have to pay the duty due on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any remaining stock in hand</li>
  <li>any unexplained shortages</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, we may allow you to destroy the cider stock in hand as if it were unfit for sale. If you wish to do this, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-11-7">paragraph 11.7</a>. However, duty must still be paid on any unexplained shortages.</p>

<p>When we’re satisfied that you’ve accounted for all duties and or destroyed your stock of cider, we’ll cancel your registration and your entry of the premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Claiming exemption from registration</h3>

<p>You may claim exemption if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you make, or propose to make, cider (including sparkling cider) for sale</li>
  <li>your total production — including cider for your own consumption — in any rolling period of 12 consecutive months does not exceed 70 hectolitres</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> To claim exemption from registration</h3>

<p>Simply complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-claim-for-exemption-from-registration-by-a-maker-of-cider-or-perry-for-sale-cp33">Alcohol duties: claim for exemption from registration by a maker of cider or perry for sale (CP33)</a> and send it to the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-2">paragraph 3.2</a> for the address).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span> What to do if you’ve claimed exemption and think your production will exceed 70 hectolitres</h3>

<p>If your production level exceeds or is likely to exceed 70 hectolitres in any rolling 12-month period, you must apply to be registered — see paragraph 3.2. You must apply for registration within 30 days if you’ve exceeded the 70 hectolitres.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.13 </span> What to do if you’re registered and your production level falls below 70 hectolitres</h3>

<p>If your production level falls below 70 hectolitres in any rolling 12-month period, you may cancel your registration and claim exemption — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-11">paragraph 3.11</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.14 </span> Production by unregistered persons or on unregistered premises</h3>

<p>Except where registration is not required (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-10">paragraph 3.10</a>), the production of cider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by a person who is not registered</li>
  <li>on premises which are not registered</li>
</ul>

<p>is an offence for which there is a penalty. You can avoid a penalty by applying for registration at the correct time. If you’ve not applied for registration, you must notify us as soon as possible. Depending on the circumstances, we may be able to reduce the penalty.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span> Financial security</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> What is financial security</h3>

<p>For the purpose of this notice, financial security is a guarantee given by an approved guarantor (for example a financial institution) who undertakes to pay money to us in the event of an irregularity covered by the guarantee. Guarantees are the only form of security acceptable to us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> When a guarantee is required</h3>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, we may require a guarantee to safeguard the duty on the following:</p>

<p>A guarantee is required for all duty suspended movements of cider between Northern Ireland and EU countries — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-3">paragraph 4.3</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<p>A guarantee may be required for movements of cider within the UK — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-3">paragraph 4.3</a>.</p>

<p>A guarantee may be required if you wish to defer payment of duty, that is, for cider that has been produced in the UK and has passed the duty point but for which duty has not been paid to HMRC, although you may be eligible for exemption under the Excise Payment Security System (<abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr>) — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-4">paragraph 4.4</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> To arrange for a movement guarantee</h3>
<p>If you’re moving goods between Northern Ireland and an EU country you will be required to provide a movement guarantee. If you’re only moving goods within the UK we may request a guarantee in certain circumstances — refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods#removal-of-goods-from-warehouse">section 10 of Excise Notice 197</a> and then make a request in writing and send to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<p>Once we have agreed your guarantee amount, we’ll issue the draft wording to your guarantor for completion of the guarantee form and return to the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr>. If satisfied, we’ll accept the guarantee and return a signed copy to the guarantor. We’ll write to you to confirm the guarantee has been approved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> When a guarantee to defer payment of duty is not required</h3>

<p>You’ll not be required to provide a guarantee if you’re eligible for authorisation under <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr>. Where an eligible business is approved for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr>, they may defer payment of duty without providing a guarantee — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-4-1">paragraphs 4.4.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-4-2">4.4.2</a>.</p>

<h4>4.4.1 <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> authorisation criteria</h4>

<p>To be eligible to apply for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> you must have been VAT registered for 3 years or more. If so, you’ll be assessed against the full <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> authorisation criteria which include checks on your VAT, excise and debt compliance history.</p>

<p>If you’re trading beneath the VAT registration threshold you’re eligible to apply for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> if you’ve been registered in an excise payment regime for 3 years or more. In this case, you’ll not be assessed against the full <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> eligibility criteria but instead checks will be made on your excise return, payment and debt compliance history.</p>

<p>Full <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> eligibility and authorisation criteria can be found on our website.</p>

<h4>4.4.2 Applying for authorisation to make payments without providing a guarantee</h4>

<p>Telephone: 03000 592 688</p>

<p>Your guarantee amount should be set at a maximum amount that is sufficient to cover all the duty likely to be due, on cider removed from your registered premises to the UK home market, in any given accounting period.</p>

<p>Note: if you’re not eligible to apply for <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr> and you wish to avoid having to provide a guarantee then, alternatively, you can pay your duty liability up front. The payment is an annual one and you must pay a year’s estimated duty in advance. You’ll need to contact the above team to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>Registered cider makers who have premises that are also approved as an excise warehouse, will be required to have a separate deferment guarantee to cover any duty due on removals from the excise warehouse unless they’re eligible to apply for authorisation to make payments without providing a guarantee.</p>

<p>You’ll not be authorised for duty deferment unless you have a guarantee or are authorised under <abbr title="Excise Payment Security System">EPSS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>4.4.4 If you do not provide a guarantee</h4>

<p>If you fail to provide a guarantee, you’ll be required to pay the duty due when the duty point occurs, that is, as soon as you despatch cider to home use from your registered premises, rather than delaying payment of the duty until the 15th day of the following month.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Who can act as a guarantor</h3>

<p>Only companies approved by us may act as guarantors. Most banks and insurance companies have this approval, but if you want to check a particular company, contact the <abbr title="Excise Processing Teams">EPT</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-3">paragraph 4.3</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Cost of guarantee</h3>

<p>The cost of the guarantee is a commercial arrangement between you and the guarantor.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Duty rates and when duty becomes due</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Rates of duty for cider</h3>

<p>The duty rates for cider are structured in bands according to the strength of the product and whether it is sparkling or not. They are stated as amounts per hectolitre (100 litres).</p>

<p>The duty bands are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-2">paragraph 5.2</a>. Our helpline, on telephone: 0300 200 3700 will advise you of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowance-excise-duty-alcohol-duty/alcohol-duty-rates-from-24-march-2014">current rates</a> on request, or you can find the rates on this website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Rates of cider duty</h3>

<p>There are 5 duty categories for cider:</p>

<p>(a) still cider exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but less than 6.9% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr><br><br>
(b) still cider at least 6.9% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr><br><br>
(c) still cider exceeding 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but less than 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr><br><br>
(d) sparkling cider exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but not exceeding 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> (this category is treated as still cider as at (a)), and<br><br>
(e) sparkling cider exceeding 5.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> but less than 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> When cider becomes liable to duty</h3>

<p>Cider becomes liable to duty once it has been produced or when it is imported into the UK. For movements of cider from Great Britain to Northern Ireland refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-2-2">section 2.2</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-2-3">2.3</a> for information on the charge to excise duty and how to account for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> When cider is liable to the sparkling rates of duty</h3>

<p>Cider is liable to the sparkling rates of duty if it has an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 5.5% but less than 8.5% and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is in a closed bottle with excess pressure, due to carbon dioxide, of 3 bars or more at 20°C</li>
  <li>regardless of pressure, is contained in a closed bottle with a ‘mushroom shaped stopper’ held in place by a tie or fastening</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Circumstances when ‘cider’ is deemed to be a made-wine or spirit</h3>

<p>Cider is deemed to be made-wine or spirit for duty and licensing purposes if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it has an actual alcoholic strength by volume of 8.5% or more</li>
  <li>the label of the container or the accompanying invoice/delivery note indicates that the alcoholic strength by volume is 8.5% or more</li>
  <li>it contains any ingredient which imparts colour or flavour and is not listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-25">section 25</a>
</li>
  <li>it contains an ingredient at a greater concentration than that set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-25">section 25</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-163-wine-production/excise-notice-163-wine-production">Excise Notice 163: wine production</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-39-spirits-production-in-the-uk/excise-notice-39-spirits-production-in-the-uk">Excise Notice 39: spirits production in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Should you wish us to add an ingredient to the list at <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-25">section 25</a>, you may consult the National Association of Cider Makers (<abbr title="National Association of Cider Makers">NACM</abbr>) as to the suitability of the ingredient as an additive to cider or perry. If they’re content that your proposal may reasonably fall within the <abbr title="The Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979">ALDA</abbr> 1979 definition of cider, submit your application along with the <abbr title="National Association of Cider Makers">NACM</abbr>’s written endorsement. You must write to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Team</a>.</p>

<p>HMRC will not approve applications for the addition of herbs or spices, or fruit juices other than apple or pear, or for flavours of any type other than those specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-25">section 25</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> When cider is made</h3>

<p>Cider is deemed to be made or produced at the point during fermentation when the strength of the product first exceeds 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Duty on low strength cider not exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Duty is remitted on any cider not exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> when it is sent out from your registered premises. To qualify for remission you must record details of the manufacturing operations in your production records. The cider may be moved using your normal commercial despatch documents.</p>

<p>If you intend to produce low strength cider by removal of alcohol from cider of a higher strength, you should first consult our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700 who will advise you on any revenue requirements that may affect the process you intend to employ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> The duty point</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-3">Paragraph 5.3</a> explains when cider becomes liable to duty, but duty only becomes payable when the cider passes the duty point, that’s when it leaves duty suspension.</p>

<p>Duty ceases to be suspended when:</p>

<p>(a) the cider leaves registered premises unless it is delivered</p>

<ul>
  <li>to other appropriately approved premises for further processing</li>
  <li>to an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>for exportation</li>
  <li>for shipment as stores</li>
  <li>to entitled diplomats</li>
  <li>to entitled members of visiting forces</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) the cider is constructively removed (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-12">paragraph 5.12</a>)</p>

<p>(c) the cider is lost</p>

<p>(d) the cider is irregularly diverted</p>

<p>(e) you’re no longer registered</p>

<p>(f) the premises on which you’re holding the cider cease to be registered premises</p>

<p>In addition, cider is considered to have left duty suspension when there is a failure to comply with any requirements relating to the duty suspension arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span> Who is liable for the duty</h3>

<p>The person holding the cider at the duty point is liable for the duty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span> When the duty must be paid</h3>

<p>Normally, the duty should be paid by the 15th day following the end of your ‘accounting period’ in which the cider passed the duty point — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-7">section 7</a> (but see also <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-2">paragraphs 4.2</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-4-4-4">4.4.4</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.11 </span> How to calculate duty on cider removed from registered premises</h3>

<p>Unless HMRC has permitted the use of an alternative methodology that does not disadvantage the revenue, you must work out each constituent stage of the calculation process to a minimum of 4 decimal places.</p>

<p>In order to complete the EX606 Duty return declaration, you must round down the quantity of cider to the nearest whole litre.</p>

<p>See the following examples:</p>

<p>(a) 155 cases of still cider, each containing 12 × 500ml at 7% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>12 × 500ml = 6 litres per case<br>
6 × 155 = 930 litres in total<br> 
930 × duty rate of *£0.5071 = £471.603, rounded down to £471.60</p>

<p>*This is the hectolitre duty rate of £50.71 converted to litres for the purposes of completing the duty return.</p>

<p>(b) 237 cases of sparkling cider, each containing 12 × 568ml at 4.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>12 × 568ml = 6.816 litres per case<br>
6.816 × 237 = 1615.392 litres in total<br> 
1615 × duty rate of £0.4038 = £652.137, rounded down to £652.13</p>

<p>(c) 419 × 3 litre container of still cider at 7.3% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>

<p>419 × 3 = 1257 litres in total<br> 
1257 × duty rate of £0.5071 = £637.4247 rounded down to £637.42</p>

<p>The duty rates used in the above calculations are those in place at the time of publication of this notice. You can find details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rates-and-allowance-excise-duty-alcohol-duty/alcohol-duty-rates-from-24-march-2014">current duty rates</a> on this website or phone our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.12 </span> What happens if the duty is not paid</h3>

<p>If you fail to pay the duty by the due date, you’ll be liable to a civil penalty of 5% of the duty or £250 — whichever is greater. In addition, further penalties may be incurred for each day that you fail to pay the duty. Details of civil penalties are contained in Notice 209 Civil Penalties: Fixed, geared and daily.</p>

<p>At any time after the due date for payment, our officer may take action to take possession of all cider, materials and equipment used in making cider or connected with your trade as a cider maker, which are either owned by you or are in your possession and auction them to recover duty due plus pay any Taking Control of Goods fees. See also <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-2-6">paragraph 2.6</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.13 </span> Paying duty in advance of cider leaving registered premises</h3>

<p>If you consider that it would help your business to account for duty on any duty suspended cider in advance of delivery from registered premises, you may do so. This is known as constructive removal and allows the registered holder of the cider to change the status of the cider held on registered premises from duty suspended to duty paid, on payment of the proper duty, without the need to remove the cider from those premises. The duty should be paid in the normal manner (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-7">section 7</a>) by the 15th of the month following the calendar month in which the cider was constructively removed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>The following requirements have the force of law and are made under Regulation 12A (3) of the Cider and Perry Regulations 1989</h4>

<p>You must record: <br><br>The date of any change of status of any cider from duty suspended to duty paid, and the product(s).</p>
</div>

<p>Note: when cider has been constructively removed, it cannot be returned to duty suspension in registered premises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.14 </span> Carrying out any operation/dilution on cider after Excise Duty has been accounted for on it</h3>

<p>No operation may be carried out on cider at any time after the Excise Duty point and before it is sold for retail, if that operation would have resulted in a greater amount of Excise Duty payable than was actually accounted for at the duty point.</p>

<p>For example, if still cider is produced and duty is accounted for at 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, it cannot be subsequently diluted to produce more volume at a lower <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, as this would effectively reduce the duty liability on the volume of finished cider.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.15 </span> Budget changes</h3>

<p>You’re responsible for declaring the correct amount of duty from the effective date of change. When the duty rate changes, we’ll notify you of the new rates, the effective date and the time of the change. Following the budget, you can find details of the duty rate changes on this website or phone our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>When the rate changes during an accounting period, you must complete 2 separate returns for the period: one at the old rates and one at the new rates. You should mark the returns pre- or post-budget as appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Records and accounts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>As a revenue trader, you should observe the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Excise Notice 206: revenue traders’ records</a>.

<p>Generally your normal business records will contain or can be modified to contain the information we require.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Accounts to keep</h3>

<p>You must keep a duty account. A duty account is a summary of the cider duty due in each accounting period.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>The following requirements have the force of law and are made under Regulation 5(1) of the Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992</h4>

<p>You must keep an account which contains the following information:</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> How long to keep records for</h3>

<p>You must normally keep your business records for 6 years. If, however, this causes problems ask our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700 if you can keep some of your records for a shorter period. You must get our agreement before destroying any of your business records that are less than 6 years old.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Keeping the original documents</h3>

<p>You can keep your records on any form of storage technology, provided that copies can be easily produced and that there are adequate facilities for allowing our officer to view them when required.</p>

<p>You should advise our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700 before you transfer records. You may be required to operate the old and new systems side by side for a limited period of time. We may refuse or withdraw approval if any requirements are not met.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep your original registration certificate in a safe place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> Keeping your records on a computer</h3>

<p>If you keep your records on a computer, we’ll require access to it so that we can check its operation and the information stored. We may ask for help from you or anyone else having charge of, or otherwise concerned with, the operation of the computer or its software.</p>

<p>If a computer bureau is employed, you’re responsible for arranging for the bureau to make your records available to us when we wish to see them. Normally this will be at your principal place of business.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Accounting for and paying duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Accounting for duty</h3>

<p>At the end of each ‘accounting period’, that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calendar month</li>
  <li>4 or 5 week period (provided this arrangement is agreed beforehand with HMRC)</li>
</ul>

<p>you must total up all the cider sent out from your premises during that period, work out the duty due, complete a duty account and transfer the appropriate totals to a ‘monthly return’ — EX606 (Wine/Made-Wine/Cider/Perry Return).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Obtaining the return form</h3>

<p>EX606s are routinely sent out to all registered cider makers. If you fail to receive a return, you should contact the Environmental Taxes team — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-7-4">paragraph 7.4</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Filling in your return</h3>

<p>You must fill in your monthly duty return, EX606, with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quantity of cider in each relative duty band you sent out for home use (or constructively removed) during the previous accounting period</li>
  <li>any allowable deductions</li>
  <li>the amount of duty you owe</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless we have given you specific authority, you may only make deductions from your duty liability as outlined in this notice.</p>

<p>You’ll find that the EX606 has full instructions on the completion of the return.</p>

<p>Returns must be completed in ink and any changes must be initialled and dated by the person who signs the declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> What happens if a duty return is not submitted</h3>

<p>If you fail to submit a return on time you’ll be liable to penalties — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-2-6">paragraph 2.6</a>. We have the authority to estimate the duty which would have been due and to pursue that debt through the civil courts — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-12">paragraph 5.12</a>.

<span class="number">7.5 </span> Who should sign the return</h3>

<p>The proprietor, a partner, the company secretary or a director of the company should sign the declaration on the return. If this is not possible, you can, as one of the above mentioned persons, authorise someone to sign the return on your behalf.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> Can a single duty return be submitted for multi-site operations</h3>

<p>Yes. If you have more than one registered premises owned by the same legal entity, you may, on request, combine the duty liability for each in the one duty return. However, an individual duty summary should be maintained for each site and consolidated in a duty account by the site submitting the return.</p>

<p>If you’re approved to produce both cider and wine/made-wine, or if you produce either product on more than one set of premises, you may, as above, combine the duty liability for both products and or premises in the one duty return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span> Accuracy of returns</h3>

<p>You can avoid a penalty by checking that you’ve given complete and accurate information in your duty return. You may be liable to a penalty if your return is inaccurate and, as a result, you do not pay enough duty or if you do not notify us that a duty assessment we have sent you is too low. If you’re aware you’ve made a mistake on your return, you must notify us as soon as possible. Depending on the circumstances, we may be able to reduce the penalty.</p>

<p>If you deliberately make a false duty return, you may face prosecution for the offence and incur a heavy penalty.</p>

<p>For further information on penalties, see link at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-14">paragraph 3.14</a>.</p>

<p>You have the right to appeal if we impose a penalty. For further information on appeals, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-27">section 27</a> and link at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-3-14">paragraph 3.14</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.8 </span> Discovering errors relating to earlier accounting periods</h3>

<p>If you discover underdeclarations relating to previous accounting periods which total less than £1,000 duty, you must enter the amounts against lines 21 to 24 on the reverse of the EX606 as appropriate, and carry the total forward to lines 37 and 18 for the current accounting period.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you discover overdeclarations totalling less than £1,000 duty, you must enter the amounts against lines 21 to 24 on the reverse of the EX606 as appropriate and carry the total to lines 38 and 19 for the current accounting period. You do not have to send a written advice, but details of the errors must be retained for inspection.</p>

<p>If, however, the total underdeclaration and or total overdeclaration is £1,000 duty or more, you must, in addition to making the adjustments outlined above, send full details in writing to the Environmental Taxes team (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-7-4">paragraph 7.4</a> for address) along with the return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.9 </span> When to send in your return and pay the duty</h3>

<p>You must submit your return and payment so that they arrive not later than the 15th day of the month following the ‘accounting period’. When the 15th day falls at a weekend or on a public holiday the return and payment must be received by the previous working day.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.10 </span> How to pay</h3>

<p>HMRC accepts payment by various methods but recommends you pay electronically using one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approve a payment through your online bank account</li>
  <li>Bacs Direct Credit</li>
  <li>CHAPS</li>
  <li>internet or phone banking</li>
</ul>

<p>A cap was introduced on 31 May 2012 by the Board of Bacs Payments Schemes Ltd (Bacs) which limits the maximum value of any single Bacs transaction. If you have a payment to make by Bacs Direct Credit which exceeds £20 million, you need to make arrangements with your own bank to make sure payment reaches HMRC on the due date, by an alternative payment method such as CHAPS.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Measurement of quantity</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>We can require duty to be accounted for on the actual quantity of cider in each container as it passes the duty point. However, most packagers do not measure the quantity in each container as they use the ‘average system’ of quantity control.</p>

<p>Under this arrangement, which is used widely throughout the UK and EU, the average contents of packages must not be less than the declared contents (that is, that marked on the can or bottle or label or, in the case of kegs and casks, on the invoice or delivery note). Within specified limits the actual contents of any particular container may be more or less than the declared contents.</p>

<p>Packagers using the average system conform to a Weights and Measures Code of Practice which has been agreed with Trading Standards. The Code is available from the National Association of Cider Makers. Packagers are obliged to monitor and record the actual quantity of cider by sampling a proportion of packages to make sure they fulfil the Code’s requirement.</p>

<h4>8.1.1 Quantity of cider to use for duty purposes</h4>

<p>When sending out cider for UK consumption from your registered premises, you should normally charge duty as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for cider delivered in small pack, that’s in containers not exceeding 10 litres, on the quantity declared on the label of the can or bottle (including polyethylene terephthalate (PETs)) or other container (for example, cider in ‘bag in box’)</li>
  <li>for cider delivered in large pack, that’s in containers with a capacity of more than 10 litres but less than 400 litres, on the quantity declared on the invoice or delivery note</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not use the average system for large pack, you should charge duty on the actual quantity of cider in each container unless you can demonstrate that you’ve not exceeded the overfill tolerances set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-3-8">paragraph 8.3.8</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, where cider is sent out in tankers or tanks with a capacity of more than 400 litres, duty should be charged on the actual quantity sent out.</p>

<h4>8.1.2 Recording the quantity of cider delivered</h4>

<p>Your normal commercial records should be acceptable provided that they contain sufficient information for calculating duty. You’ll also need to enter the total volume of cider delivered during the accounting period on the EX606 duty return — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-7">section 7</a>.</p>

<h4>8.1.3 Reasons to record the quantity of cider delivered</h4>

<p>Apart from normal commercial considerations, you must record the quantity of cider delivered because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quantity will affect the calculation of the duty</li>
  <li>if the delivery is under duty suspension and subject to pilferage, an accurate assessment of the loss will be needed</li>
  <li>it may affect the adequacy of any financial guarantees</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Small pack</h3>

<h4>8.2.1 Method used for ascertaining quantity in small pack</h4>

<p>Small pack refers to containers of 10 litres capacity and less. Packagers are required to fill these containers in accordance with ‘average contents’ rules (the system referred to in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-1">paragraph 8.1</a>).</p>

<h4>8.2.2 Sampling rate to use</h4>

<p>You’re required to take samples as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a minimum of 2 samples must be taken per shift</li>
  <li>each sample must be a minimum of 5 packages</li>
  <li>at least one sample should be taken for each production run</li>
</ul>

<p>Subject to compliance with these requirements, the average of the samples taken for the purpose of complying with average contents rules will be treated as the quantity of cider in a container.</p>

<h4>8.2.3 Quantity to use for duty purposes</h4>

<p>Evidence of compliance with Weights and Measures legislation will be sufficient to accept the labelled contents as the duty base, unless there are grounds for believing that deliberate duty avoidance is involved.</p>

<h4>8.2.4 Meaning of ‘due diligence’</h4>

<p>‘Due diligence’ is the term used for the measures you have in place to monitor the filling process and the actions you take to prevent and or rectify any instances of excessive over or under filling found.</p>

<h4>8.2.5 Demonstrating that ‘due diligence’ has been observed</h4>

<p>You should monitor the filling process to make sure that the quantity put into the package does not regularly excessively exceed the amount declared on the label. You should record these checks and provide an adequate audit trail to satisfy our officer that ‘due diligence’ is being exercised.</p>

<p>Where there’s evidence of consistent excessive overfilling, additional duty will be due.</p>

<h4>8.2.6 Circumstances when additional duty would be paid</h4>

<p>Duty becomes payable at the end of the accounting period in which a container of cider is delivered to home use. That is, when it passes the duty point.</p>

<p>Where you’ve incurred an additional duty liability as a result of overfilling, the additional duty should be paid in the relevant accounting period when cider is supplied to home use from your registered premises or from registered premises or excise warehouses owned or operated by your company.</p>

<p>If you fail to properly record and or pay the additional duty due on excess volume that you’ve delivered to home use, we’ll assess you for the additional duty due. If you cannot produce accurate records from which the additional amount of duty can be readily established, including quantities delivered to home use, we’ll use ‘best judgement’.</p>

<p>In the case of overfilled containers of cider supplied in duty suspension to third parties, you should record details of these deliveries separately in your records. The law requires that the person holding the goods at the time of their delivery to home use, is liable for the duty, including that on the volume in excess of the declared quantity. However, if we’re satisfied that the third party was unaware that the container had been overfilled and that the third party is entirely independent of you, we’ll not normally recover the additional duty due. In deciding whether or not to pursue the additional duty we’ll take into account the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relationship between you and the third party</li>
  <li>contracts of supply, if appropriate</li>
  <li>the price paid for the goods</li>
  <li>any other information considered relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>This system has been devised taking into account, as far as possible, existing trade practices so minimising your compliance costs. Any attempt to evade duty by underdeclaring the quantity on which duty is charged or by manipulating deliveries to evade duty, may lead to prosecution.</p>

<h4>8.2.7 Combining the results of monitoring the volume for 2 or more products</h4>

<p>For small pack, we’ll normally require you to assess the monitoring results separately for each product. However, if in exceptional circumstances, for example, where a small amount of a seasonal product is packaged and separate monitoring would produce an inequitable outcome, we’ll consider requests for combining the monitoring results for a number of products.</p>

<h4>8.2.8 Arrangements in place for cans with widgets</h4>

<p>If the widget you use retains cider, then that retained quantity need not be declared for duty purposes. You must carry out tests to confirm the average retention volume. This average retention must be agreed with HMRC. Once agreed, the ‘due diligence’ concept may be applied to the labelled quantity plus the retained amount.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Large pack</h3>

<h4>8.3.1 Method used to ascertain the quantity in large pack</h4>

<p>Large pack refers to containers in excess of 10 litres capacity up to a maximum of 400 litres such as kegs and casks. Containers of over 400 litres are generally referred to as ‘bulk’, and should be treated individually, with the actual measured quantity being used.</p>

<p>Packagers of large pack containers customarily fill casks and kegs in accordance with the average contents rules (the system referred to in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-1">paragraph 8.1</a>). Provided that the average quantity of the samples taken for the purpose of complying with the average contents rules complies with those rules, then the nominal contents, or whatever other quantity that may be declared on a label or sales invoice and so on, will be treated as the quantity of cider in a container.</p>

<h4>8.3.2 Sampling rate used</h4>

<p>Under the average contents rules, packagers are permitted some latitude in the sampling regime that they adopt.</p>

<p>In determining volume for duty purposes, packagers will be expected to maintain a minimum sampling rate of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one container per filling head per operating day</li>
  <li>0.1% of a production run in excess of 4,000 containers, the samples to be representative of the mix of containers filled</li>
</ul>

<p>A copy of the sampling protocol you intend to use for the purpose of assuring compliance with ‘average contents’ rules and for duty purposes should be sent in to the address as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-5">paragraph 5.5</a>.</p>

<h4>8.3.3 Smaller packagers</h4>

<p>Some smaller packagers do not take samples but use their containers as capacity measures. In order to meet the tolerance requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-3-8">paragraph 8.3.8</a>, these packagers should take steps to make sure the average capacity of their containers are operating within the set limits.</p>

<h4>8.3.4 Quantity used for duty purposes when cider is produced in large pack</h4>

<p>The quantity of cider in any container will be treated as the amount shown on the label of the container or on any invoice, delivery note or similar document issued in relation to the cider, subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>(a) that you maintain records of the quantity of cider found in samples you take for the purpose of compliance with ‘average contents’ rules</p>

<p>(b) that a proper record is kept of the monitoring and control procedures, including a statement of the sampling protocol, used for the purpose of assuring compliance with these rules</p>

<p>(c) that the tolerances referred to <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-3-8">paragraph 8.3.8</a> are adhered to</p>

<p>For containers with a capacity in excess of 400 litres, the quantity for duty purposes is the greater of the actual quantity despatched or that stated on the delivery note or invoice.</p>

<p>At the end of each accounting period, for each target population of containers, you should calculate the average volume from the measured volumes of the samples you’ve taken. These sample volumes are to be expressed to 2 decimal places and truncated if necessary. The accounting period average is to be truncated to one decimal place. This calculation should be performed for each racking line for each container size. Individual types of cider may also be treated separately if that is the rule established in your sampling protocol as part of your monitoring and control procedures.</p>

<h4>8.3.5 Cask-conditioned cider</h4>

<p>Cask-conditioned cider continues to ferment in the cask for some time, producing a residue which often cannot be consumed. This is known as undrinkable sediment.</p>

<p>Duty need not be charged on any undrinkable sediment in your cask-conditioned cider, provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your customer (for example, the publican) is made fully aware in writing, at or before the time of receipt, of the quantity of cider on which duty has been charged — if, for example, a barrel of 36 gallons (163.7 litres) contains ½ gallon (2.3 litres) of undrinkable sediment, the customer must be made aware, by a statement on the label, delivery note or price list for example, that duty has been charged on 161.4 litres (a copy of the notification to customers must be retained)</li>
  <li>you can, if required to do so, satisfy our officer that only undrinkable sediment has been excluded from the duty charge</li>
</ul>

<p>Any sediment on which duty has not been charged cannot be included in any subsequent claims for relief on spoilt cider.</p>

<h4>8.3.6 Calculating the amount of undrinkable sediment</h4>

<p>There is no prescribed method. You must, however, be able to satisfy us that the method you use gives equitable results.</p>

<p>The measurement of undrinkable sediment in any container returned to you is not an acceptable method as the cider has been outside your control and may have been tampered with.</p>

<p>Sediment levels for each quality of cider and container size must be regularly monitored by producers and reviewed/amended (as necessary) at least annually and notified to us. Any changes to recipes/ingredients, and so on during the year, which would significantly affect sediment levels, must be notified to us and the allowance adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>You must write to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise Enquiries Team</a>.</p>

<h4>8.3.7 Is there an undrinkable sediment allowance for polypins, mini-pins and bottle-conditioned cider</h4>

<p>There’s no undrinkable sediment allowance for polypins and mini-pins sold by cider makers to the public or on bottle-conditioned cider.</p>

<h4>8.3.8 Filling tolerances</h4>

<p>The filling tolerances are set out in the Schedule to the Cider and Perry Regulations 1989 and are:</p>

<p>(a) in the case of filling controlled by meter or weighing</p>

<p>in the accounting period, the average volume of the samples for each container size from each racking line must not exceed the following tolerances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the declared quantity plus 0.5 litres for containers intended to contain a volume not exceeding 100 litres</li>
  <li>the declared quantity plus 0.5% for containers intended to contain a volume above 100 litres but not more than 400 litres</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) in the case of containers filled using other systems of control or filling to capacity</p>

<p>in the accounting period, the average volume of the samples for each container size from each racking line must not exceed the following tolerances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the declared quantity plus 1 litre for containers intended to contain a volume of 100 litres and less</li>
  <li>the declared quantity plus 2 litres for containers intended to contain a volume exceeding 100 litres but not exceeding 200 litres</li>
  <li>the declared quantity plus 3 litres for containers intended to contain a volume exceeding 200 litres but not more than 400 litres</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.3.9 If the overfill tolerance is exceeded</h4>

<p>If the average volume of the samples in a target population of containers for a racking line exceeds the specified tolerance in any accounting period, there will be an additional duty liability when that cider is sent to home-use.</p>

<h4>8.3.10 How to calculate any additional duty liability</h4>

<p>The volume on which additional duty is due is not just the amount in excess of the tolerance, but is the whole quantity of cider in excess of the nominal contents for that target population of containers.</p>

<p>The 2 examples below should help you to work this out.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>If you packed by meter or weight control and your target population of containers intended to hold 50 litres was:</p>

<p>1,000 containers of cider not exceeding 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, and</p>

<p>500 containers of cider exceeding 7.5% but less than 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, the filling tolerance (from <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-3-8a">paragraph 8.3.8a</a>) would be 0.5 litres per container.</p>

<p>If, at the end of the accounting period, your monitoring record showed that the average contents of each container was 50.7 litres, additional duty will be due on the whole quantity in excess of the nominal quantity, that is, 0.7 litres, multiplied by the number of containers delivered to home use from the target population during the accounting period at the appropriate duty rate.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>If you packed by filling to capacity or another method other than metering or weighing, and your target population of containers intended to hold 50 litres was:</p>

<p>1,000 containers of cider not exceeding 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, and</p>

<p>500 containers of cider exceeding 7.5% but less than 8.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, the filling tolerance (from <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-3-8b">paragraph 8.3.8b</a>) would be 1 litre per container.</p>

<p>If, at the end of the accounting period, your monitoring record showed that the average contents of each container was 51.1 litres, additional duty will be due on the whole quantity in excess of the declared quantity, that is, 1.1 litres, multiplied by the number of containers delivered to home use from the target population during the accounting period at the appropriate duty rate.</p>

<p>For further details on when additional duty should be paid, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-8-2-6">paragraph 8.2.6</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Alcoholic strength</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> What is alcoholic strength</h3>

<p>Alcoholic strength is the percentage of alcohol by volume (<abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>) in the cider at 20°C. For duty purposes, this should be rounded down to one decimal place, for example, 7.59% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> becomes 7.5% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> How to measure alcoholic strength</h3>

<p>You may use any method you wish to measure the strength of cider as long as it produces results that agree with those that would be achieved using the distillation analysis method (also known as the reference method) described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-26">section 26</a>. This is particularly important if the strength of your cider is close to the top of its duty banding.</p>

<p>If you do not use distillation analysis to measure your <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>, you must be prepared to explain your method and show that your results agree with those that would have been achieved had it been used.</p>

<p>For any methods not based on laboratory analysis, an independent analyst must test the <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> of each of your products, at least annually, to confirm consistency with calculated results. The results of these independent analyses must be held in your business records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> The alcoholic strength used for duty purposes</h3>

<p>For duty purposes, the alcoholic strength of cider is the actual strength when it passes the duty point.</p>

<p>However, if you comply with certain conditions, we’ll accept for duty purposes the declared strength.</p>

<p>For cask or bottled-conditioned cider, the alcoholic strength for duty purposes is the strength you reasonably expect the cider to have when it’s sold or otherwise supplied for consumption.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> Conditions for using the declared strength</h3>

<p>If you wish to use the declared strength for duty purposes, you must be able to demonstrate that you’ve exercised due diligence in the control of your process to make sure that, on average, the actual <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> of each finished product equates to that which you’re declaring.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span> Demonstrating that due diligence has been exercised in the control of <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You must continuously monitor and record your <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> results, which should normally fall randomly on either side of the target strength. The average of your results should equate closely with the target which must be the declared strength.</p>

<p>It’s recognised that the <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> of the same product may occasionally vary, but provided appropriate action is taken quickly to return the strength of the cider to within its normal specification, due diligence will have been demonstrated. You must keep records of any action taken to maintain product strength within control limits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span> Measuring the strength of each product</h3>

<p>You must establish the strength of each discrete batch of each of your products. Where cider from one batch is packaged into different container types, for example, cans and bottles, you may combine the results.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span> Infrequent or one-off products</h3>

<p>If you can demonstrate to us that, based on available information and experience, due care was taken when deciding target ABVs for new and or infrequently produced qualities (and that all decisions, actions and so on, were properly recorded), we’ll accept the declared strength for duty purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span> How the accuracy of this system is checked by HMRC</h3>

<p>We’ll examine your results and your record of actions taken. Where the target strength coincides with the limit of a duty band, and where the results are consistently above target, we’ll ask you to demonstrate that action was taken to bring the process back into control or to change the declared <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> as soon as the problem was identified. If you’ve failed to take action, an assessment will be raised for the additional duty due. Remember that if the average <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> exceeds 8.4%, your product cannot be classified as a cider for duty purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.9 </span> Do I use the same arrangements for measuring strength of cider which may be delivered under duty suspension</h3>

<p>Yes, because it’s likely that the cider will subsequently be delivered on payment of duty, the same arrangements must apply for all cider you produce.</p>

<p>As it’s the responsibility of the person holding the cider at the duty point to account for the duty, if you despatch packages in duty suspension on which the strength is understated, you must inform the consignee accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.10 </span> If there’s a dispute over the strength</h3>

<p>Our officer may take samples of cider which will be analysed using the reference method described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-26">section 26</a>. The results of these analyses will establish the actual dutiable strength of the cider for legal purposes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Duty reliefs — general information</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> Duty relief entitlement</h3>

<p>Natural losses and wastage and other legitimate causes for lost product are not liable to duty provided we’re satisfied that they are genuine losses that are down to the production process.</p>

<p>There’s also provision for duty relief on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accidental losses on registered premises — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-11-2">paragraph 11.2</a>
</li>
  <li>spoilt cider or cider otherwise unfit for use — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-11-7">paragraphs 11.7</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-13">section 13</a>
</li>
  <li>cider not exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-5-7">paragraph 5.7</a>
</li>
  <li>trade samples — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-14">section 14</a>
</li>
  <li>cider for your own domestic consumption — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-15">section 15</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Irregularities, losses and deficiencies in registered premises</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Responsibilities as a registered cider maker</h3>

<p>As a registered cider maker, you’re responsible for the control of cider in your registered premises. You must have the necessary systems in place to control and safeguard your stocks. You must critically examine all losses and deficiencies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> If I accidentally lose duty suspended cider, do I have to pay the duty</h3>

<p>No, providing we’re satisfied that the cider has been lost in registered premises and has not been consumed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Keeping records of losses</h3>

<p>You need to keep records of production and processing and these should indicate how much cider you lose during routine operations, for example, the losses you normally incur during packaging operations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>The following requirements have the force of law and are made under Regulation 6 of the Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992</h4>

<p>For accidental losses you must record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date and time the loss occurred</li>
  <li>the description (product name) and the volume of cider lost, and the alcoholic strength if the loss occurred after production had been completed</li>
  <li>the vessels in which it was contained, and the reason why the accidental loss occurred</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> Unexplained losses</h3>

<p>If cider cannot be accounted for after the start of production, and there’s no acceptable explanation, you’re liable for duty on the missing cider. It’s therefore in your own interest to keep proper records of all losses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> Can I offset stock losses against surpluses</h3>

<p>Yes, if you hold documentary evidence demonstrating that stock losses and surpluses are related. Your records must contain a clear audit trail to justify any adjustments of stock records following the discovery of errors. You must justify each offset. We do not allow you to accumulate losses and surpluses from various sources and then offset gross totals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span> Losses of duty paid cider</h3>

<p>Normally there’s no duty relief in respect of cider which is lost after it has passed the duty point.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span> If duty suspended cider is spoilt, do I have to pay the duty</h3>

<p>No, providing we’re satisfied that the cider has been unintentionally spoilt, contaminated or otherwise rendered unfit for consumption in the registered premises and has not been consumed. You may ‘write off’ the quantities concerned after you’ve recorded the information in your records and destroyed any spoilt product.</p>

<p>We may examine your records as part of our audit process. If we’re not satisfied with your explanation and supporting evidence, we’ll require you to pay the duty on the quantity previously ‘written off’.</p>

<p>Remember that other legislation may apply when you destroy spoilt cider — for example, legislation on pollution.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.12 </span> Making a claim</h3>

<p>At the end of the accounting period, total the entries in your spoilt cider record of all cider destroyed or reprocessed and transfer the total to your cider duty account. When you submit your next monthly return, deduct the duty you’re reclaiming by entering it against lines 21 to 24 on the reverse of the EX606 as appropriate and carry the total to line 38.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.13 </span> Particulars of the spoilt cider record</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>The following requirements have the force of law and are made under Regulation 26(1) (d) of the Cider and Perry Regulations 1989</h4>

<p>When cider is either returned to the registered premises for destruction or destroyed remotely, you must enter the following particulars in the destruction section of your spoilt cider record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total volume of spoilt cider destroyed</li>
  <li>the strength of the spoilt cider destroyed</li>
  <li>the date and time of the destruction</li>
  <li>the place and method of destruction</li>
  <li>the volume and strength of the cider in each container from which the spoilt cider was directly destroyed</li>
  <li>evidence of the amount of duty charged or paid</li>
  <li>the amount of spoilt cider relief claimed</li>
  <li>the description of the cider returned by each purchaser in respect of which a claim is made</li>
  <li>the name and address of each purchaser</li>
  <li>the numbers and sizes of each container in which the cider was returned by each purchaser returning the cider</li>
</ul>

<p>When cider is returned for reprocessing, enter the following particulars in a reprocessing section of your spoilt cider record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total volume of cider reprocessed</li>
  <li>the strength of the cider reprocessed</li>
  <li>the date and time the cider was returned for reprocessing</li>
  <li>the volume and strength of the cider in each container in which it was returned for processing</li>

</div>

<p>When keg empties are returned to the registered premises and residues removed for destruction, you must enter the following particulars in the destruction section of your spoilt cider record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the total volume of keg residue destroyed</li>
  <li>the strength of the keg residue destroyed</li>
  <li>the date and time of the destruction</li>
  <li>evidence of duty charged or paid</li>
  <li>the amount of relief claimed</li>
</ul>

<p>Residues from returned kegs (which contained duty paid cider) must be decanted into a separate vessel and accurately measured to determine the quantity for relief. Residues from kegs returned from export do not qualify for this relief.</p>

<p>Residues are not considered to be spoilt cider and they do not meet the provisions for spoilt cider relief under the Cider and Perry regulations 1989. However, as a concession and for administrative purposes, residues can be entered in the spoilt cider record and duty can be claimed, along with duty on spoilt cider, on the cider duty return. Alternatively and subject to certain conditions, provision is also available for reclaiming duty on keg residues under the Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995.</p>

<p>At the end of the accounting period, total the entries in the spoilt cider record of all destroyed and reprocessed cider. Transfer the total to your cider duty account for claiming relief on your cider duty return.</p>

<span class="number">14. </span> Samples</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span> What duty-free samples can I take</h3>

<h4>14.1.1 Production and reference samples</h4>

<p>You may take these for analysis and organoleptic appreciation (but not consumption) provided you enter the quantities and reasons for removal in your samples records.</p>

<p>The samples should be used up in tests, destroyed or returned to process when you’ve finished with them.</p>

<h4>14.1.2 Genuine ‘trade samples’</h4>

<p>You may take these provided you enter the quantities and reasons for removal in your samples records. Trade samples must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not be intended for consumption</li>
  <li>be restricted to quantities not exceeding 1 litre per product</li>
  <li>be clearly labelled ‘NOT FOR SALE’</li>
  <li>be supplied to a wholesaler, distributor or a potential trade customer</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be a genuine trade purpose for supplying the samples, for example, for analysis and tests to be carried out on the cider before purchase.</p>

<p>Cider used for promotions and for tastings at, for example, trade fairs, shows, exhibitions and supermarkets must be duty-paid.</p>

<p>If the samples are not supplied free of charge you must pay duty on them.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span> What duty-paid samples can I take</h3>

<p>You may take duty-paid samples for any business purpose. There is no restriction on size or on the number you take. You should pay duty in the normal manner and record details in your business records.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Duty on domestic consumption</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> Cider that you or your employees drink</h3>

<p>If you’re a grower who produces cider from your own fruit you may deliver from your premises, duty-free, approved quantities of cider for your own domestic consumption, or for drinking free of charge by your employees.</p>

<p>The term grower refers to a person who owns or leases orchards for which he is responsible for the cultivation, nurturing and harvesting thereof. This need not be done personally, the grower may contract others to carry out the work for him, but he is responsible for the supervision of any contracted work.</p>

<p>The term domestic consumption means consumption or use by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the grower and the grower’s family or, in the case of a limited or public company, its directors</li>
  <li>the grower’s employees and guests</li>
</ul>

<h4>15.1.1 Basis for the entitlement to relief</h4>

<p>The entitlement is based on the quantity of cider produced in the preceding calendar year (January to December) and must not exceed the actual quantity produced.</p>

<p>So, if no cider is produced in the preceding calendar year there is no entitlement to domestic consumption. No part of your entitlement can be carried forward from one year to the next.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Working out domestic relief</h3>

<p>You may claim domestic consumption relief on cider you use for your own domestic drinking or for drinking free of charge by your employees or guests.</p>

<p>If you wish to claim this relief, you must record the details in your business records stating how much cider is to be used for each purpose. There is no upper limit on the amount of relief you can claim. However, you must be able to satisfy us that your claim is not excessive. You’ll be liable to pay duty on any quantity overclaimed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> Paying duty on cider given to visitors</h3>

<p>As long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no charge is made for admission to the premises</li>
  <li>no charge is made for the cider</li>
  <li>the cider is supplied by the glass and not in bottles or other take away packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>You may regard the visitor as a guest and the drink consumed may be taken from your domestic consumption allowance.</p>

  <li>a unique reference number</li>
  <li>the name and address of the premises you’re sending the cider</li>
  <li>the date of despatch</li>
  <li>a description of the cider, including the quantity</li>
  <li>a statement indicating that the cider is being moved in duty suspension</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span> Northern Ireland — sending duty suspended cider to a non-registered trader or private individual in an EU member state</h3>

<p>If you’re sending the cider direct to a non-registered trader then you must make sure that the duty is paid prior to the cider leaving your registered premises. You may be able to reclaim the duty as drawback — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-17-4">paragraph 17.4</a>.</p>

<p>If the non-registered trader appoints an agent who is authorised to receive duty suspended excise goods, then UK duty does not need to be paid. However, the movement must be submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, with the agent shown as the consignee on the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’re sending the cider to a private individual (rather than a trader), this is known as distance selling. You must make sure that the duty is paid prior to the cider leaving your registered premises. You may be able to reclaim the duty as drawback — see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-17-4">paragraph 17.4</a>. Additionally you, as the seller, are responsible for ensuring that the duty is paid in the member state of destination.

<span class="number">17.4 </span> Northern Ireland — despatching duty-paid cider to EU member states</h3>

<p>The duty in the member state of destination must be secured before the despatch of the goods and then paid on receipt. How this is done depends on the rules in the receiving EU member state. Unless the goods are being despatched to a private individual (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-17-3">paragraph 17.3</a>), the goods must be accompanied at all times by a Simplified Accounting Administrative Document.</p>

<p>You may be able to reclaim the UK duty on the grounds that you despatch.

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span> Customs declaration to use</h3>

<p>You must complete an Export Declaration. Information and guidance is contained in the Tariff, Volume 3, parts 1 and 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span> Obtaining evidence of export</h3>

<p>Providing the correct procedures have been followed for exports (direct and indirect) to non-EU countries using <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, HMRC will send you a report of export through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> which discharges the movement. Where no report of export is given for any reason, HMRC will issue a report of rejected export (an IE839 message). On receipt of an IE839 message, you may be requested to provide alternative evidence of export as shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<p>For direct exports made using Customs Supervised Exports (CSE) previously known as Local Clearance Procedures (<abbr title="Local Clearance Procedures">LCP</abbr>) from your premises (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-21-2">paragraph 21.2</a>), you should receive a ‘departure message’ from Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) which should be retained as proof of export.</p>

<p>You may be liable for duty if you cannot produce evidence that cider removed from your premises has been exported from the UK or, in the case of Northern Ireland, through an EU member state.</p>

<p>Further information on reports of export, <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>/<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> departure messages and alternative evidence of export can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span> Exporting duty paid cider</h3>

<p>If you export duty paid, provided certain conditions are met, you may reclaim the duty under the Excise Duty Drawback system. For further details, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback">Excise Notice 207: Excise Duty drawback</a>. To reclaim the duty, you must be able to produce evidence that the cider left the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.5 </span> Supplying duty suspended cider from Northern Ireland to entitled organisations in EU member states</h3>

<p>You must obtain an order together with an exemption certificate when supplying cider in duty suspension from Northern Ireland to entitled international organisations, embassies and forces located in the EU. You must use <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> for the removal of cider from your premises. You’ll find more information on this and the procedures to follow in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<h4>18.5.1 Small producers in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland exporting cider to outside the EU</h4>

<p>If the country you are exporting to operates a small cider producer’s scheme, the consignee may ask you to provide a certificate, endorsed by HMRC, that the cider you’re exporting is small producer’s cider produced in the UK. This is so they can establish in advance of the importation to their country that the producer in the UK and the cider is eligible under their rules. It is your responsibility to be aware of the rules and production volume limits of the small producer’s cider scheme in the country you are exporting to, so that their requirements are met.</p>

<p>If a certificate is required, you will need to make a self-declaration of your production volumes which HMRC will certify. The following process applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>copy the certificate template shown at section 18.6 and paste or save as a word document</li>
  <li>complete the first part of the document, then print and sign it</li>
  <li>scan the document and attach to an email</li>
  <li>send the email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nru.alcohol@hmrc.gov.uk">nru.alcohol@hmrc.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>the Excise Processing Teams will validate by completing the ‘Certification – For Official Use’ part of the document and return it to you</li>
</ul>

<p>The process is temporary until a new print and post iform is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>You’ll need to use <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> when moving cider in duty-suspension to the place of export.</p>

<p>The following statement that cider is ‘small producer’s cider’ will be required on the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr>:</p>

<p>‘It is hereby certified that the product described has been produced by an independent producer of fermented beverages other than wine and beer.’</p>

<p>The annual production of alcoholic beverages of the small independent producer shall be declared in box 17n of the administrative document</p>

<p>The above statement will let the person who removes the cider from duty-suspension to establish that the cider is small producer’s cider.</p>

<p>A movement guarantee is required for exports.</p>

<p>For more information on deliveries and exports through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h4>18.5.2 Small producers in Northern Ireland moving cider in duty suspense to the EU</h4>

<p>If the country you are moving cider to operates a small producer reduced duty rate for cider you will need to provide information on <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> to show that the cider meet the small producer requirements. In box 17 of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> the following statement that cider is ‘small producer cider’ will be required:</p>

<p>‘It is hereby certified that the product described has been produced by an independent small producer.’</p>

<p>The annual production of alcoholic beverages of the small independent producer shall be declared in box 17n of the administrative document.</p>

<p>A movement guarantee is required.

<h3>
<span class="number">19.1 </span> Removing cider to HM Ships</h3>

<p>HMRC allows certain HM Ships to receive cider free from Excise (and Customs) Duty. These removals are treated as exports, with the point of exportation being the delivery of the cider to the ship.</p>

<p>Movements to HM Ships are not considered to be in duty suspension and, therefore, do not move under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> procedures. You must complete commercial documentation for the removal of cider from your premises.</p>

<p>You’ll find more information on this and the procedures to follow in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.2 </span> Removing cider as ships’ stores</h3>

<p>You may remove cider from your premises to be shipped as stores on board ships within the UK.</p>

<p>These movements are not considered to be in duty suspension but supplied under relief and, therefore, do not move under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> procedures.</p>

<p>The ship’s master must get prior authorisation from HMRC to load new stores onto his vessel.

<p>All intra UK movements of cider will need to be submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> unless they qualify for the simplification procedures, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-21-2">paragraph 21.2</a>.</p>

<p>You may only remove cider to:</p>

<p>(a) another registered cider maker’s premises for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>blending or mixing with other ciders</li>
  <li>conditioning and bottling or kegging</li>
  <li>rendering sparkling, destruction</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) a licensed made-wine producer’s premises for use in the production of made-wine</p>

<p>You’ll be responsible for the duty on the cider until you receive a receipt. The receiving cider maker or made-wine producer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete a report of receipt, if the movement is submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>sign the cider duty receipt (for example, the delivery note) if under simplified procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>The receiving cider maker or made-wine producer must issue a receipt within 5 days of the date of receipt of the cider in their registered or licensed premises. If you do not receive a receipt, you should contact them. If you fail to obtain a receipt within 4 months, you’ll be liable for the duty due on the cider. If you subsequently receive a receipt, you may credit your duty account with the appropriate amount of duty.</p>

<p>When cider is delivered to home-use from the receiving cider premises, duty will become due. Duty must be paid by the maker who finally delivers the cider to home use.</p>

<p>Except in the case of bottlers or packagers returning cider to the premises from which it was received, finished or packaged cider must not be moved, without payment of duty, from one set of registered premises to another.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">21.2 </span> New simplification procedures</h3>

<p>Simplification procedures apply to certain UK movements and allows for cider to be moved under duty suspension using commercial documentation or Customs documentation instead of <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>. These procedures are limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cider moving between UK registered cider makers or 3rd party packagers or excise warehouses approved to receive and store the cider — ownership of the cider must remain with the cider maker during the course of the movement</li>
  <li>movements for direct export only from the UK where the dispatching cider maker is authorised for <abbr title="Local Clearance Procedures">LCP</abbr> and can provide a full customs export declaration — movement guarantee details must be shown on the declaration — further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Excise Notice 197: receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If movements do not meet the above criteria, then it will be necessary to use <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">21.3 </span> What is a finished and packaged product</h3>

<p>You may remove cider, without payment of duty, to an excise warehouse (approved under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979) for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>export, shipment as stores or removal to the Isle of Man</li>
  <li>use in the manufacture of goods allowed to be produced in an excise warehouse</li>
  <li>bottling</li>
  <li>packaging</li>
  <li>storage and subsequent delivery to home use or another warehouse</li>
  <li>rendering sparkling</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of finished and packaged product, each package must carry a satisfactory identifying mark and number. Containers must be full and each case must hold containers of uniform size.</p>

<p>Note: that if you send duty suspended cider to an excise warehouse for bottling, packaging or storage, you’ll need to be approved as a registered owner of warehoused goods under the Warehousekeepers and Owners of Warehoused Goods Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1278). You’ll find more information on this and the procedures to follow in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196: excise goods — registration and approval of warehousekeepers, warehouse premises, owners of goods and registered consignors</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.2 </span> Documents that must accompany the cider</h3>

<p>If the movement is under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, an <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> will have to be raised on <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> before the movement can start. <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> automatically allocates an <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> that uniquely identifies the movement. The <abbr title="Administrative Reference Code">ARC</abbr> will be on the printed copy of the <abbr title="electronic administrative document">eAD</abbr> or should be noted on the commercial document and must travel with the goods.</p>

<p>If the movement is under simplified procedures and is as described in first bullet point of <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-21-2">paragraph 21.2</a>, your normal commercial despatch documents will be suitable if they contain all the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the description of the cider</li>
  <li>its alcoholic strength</li>
  <li>details of the quantity contained in each package (and if appropriate, the capacity of each container)</li>
  <li>the total quantity sent</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep a copy of the despatch document and the warehousekeeper’s receipt for your own records.

<h3>
<span class="number">23.1 </span> Cider received into your registered premises from other registered premises or excise warehouses</h3>

<p>All intra UK movements of cider will need to be submitted through <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> unless they qualify for the simplification procedures.</p>

<p>On receipt of cider, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inspect the delivery vehicle to make sure that it is secure and any locks and seals are intact</li>
  <li>examine all containers, for example, externally for signs of damage</li>
  <li>check the delivery against the document accompanying the cider</li>
  <li>issue a receipt within 5 days of the cider being received — if movement under <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>, this will be a report of receipt or, if under simplified procedures, a certificate of receipt (for example, copy of delivery note) signed by an authorised person</li>
  <li>record issue of the receipt</li>
  <li>enter the quantity received into your stock records</li>
  <li>keep the accompanying document</li>
</ul>

<p>If you discover a discrepancy between the cider received and the accompanying document, you must issue a receipt only for the cider you actually receive. Show the discrepancy clearly on the certificate of receipt or include an inventory of the shortage or loss in the report of receipt.</p>

<p>The cider received becomes part of your stock and is subject to the same rules as the product you produce on your registered premises.</p>

<p>Remember, if you’re not approved as an excise warehouse, you can only receive cider in a ready for sale state if you produced it yourself.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">24. </span> Notification of cash transactions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">24.1 </span> Notifying us if you’re paid in cash for the supply of cider</h3>

<p>As a registered cider maker, you’re required to notify us if you’ve been paid, or expect to be paid, in cash for the supply of duty suspended cider exceeding £9,000 (or equivalent in other currencies).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">24.2 </span> Notifying of supply</h3>

<p>You must complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-cash-payments-for-alcohol-goods-or-services-in-duty-suspension-w7">W7 Notification of cash payments for alcohol goods or alcohol related services in duty suspension</a> or phone our helpline on telephone: 0300 200 3700.</p>

<p>You must send the completed form to the fax number or email address shown on the W7.</p>

<p>If you’re paid, or expect to be paid, in 2 or more instalments, which individually are below the £9,000 notification threshold but in total will exceed this amount, you must also notify us on form W7 when the first cash payment is received.</p>

<p>Provided you’ve notified the transaction to us, you do not need to wait for us to respond to receipt of the W7 before removing duty suspended cider to other UK registered premises, UK excise warehouses or EU member states.</p>

<p>You’re also required to notify us of any cash payments received (exceeding £9,000) for any service you provide relating to duty suspended cider, for example, storage facilities, handling charges, packaging of cider or, in the case of Northern Ireland, use of an Excise movement guarantee.</p>

<span class="number">26. </span> Distillation analysis: method of determining the strength of cider</h2>

<p>This method is referred to in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-9">section 9</a>.</p>

<p>If there’s a dispute over strength our officer may take samples of cider which will be analysed using the following method:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take a representative sample and, after clearing it of sediment and gas in an approved manner, a definite quantity by measure at the temperature of 20°C is made alkaline by the addition of calcium hydroxide, and then distilled</li>
  <li>make up the distillate at the temperature of 20°C with distilled water to the original measure of the quantity before distillation</li>
  <li>ascertain the strength of the distillate by determining its density in air at the temperature of 20°C by means of an approved pycnometer used in an approved manner</li>
  <li>the strength of product is the percentage of alcohol by volume in the ‘Laboratory Alcohol Table’ which corresponds to the density determined by this method — where the density falls between 2 consecutive numbers in the table the strength will be determined by linear interpolation</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the result ascertained by this method is rendered inaccurate by the presence of substances other than alcohol, that method will be adjusted as approved by HMRC for the purpose of producing an accurate result.</p>

<p>*‘Laboratory Alcohol Table’ means a table of which a copy, signed by the Chairman of the Commissioners and identifying it as relating to the Spirits Regulations 1991, has been deposited in the office of the Queen’s Remembrancer at the Royal Courts of Justice</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">27. </span> Review and appeal procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.1 </span> Disagreeing with any decision made about your affairs</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll tell you and offer you a review. We’ll explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree.</p>

<p>For example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment</li>
  <li>the issue of a civil penalty</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to the relevant duty</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll usually have 3 options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer you’ve been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.2 </span> Time limit to ask for a review</h3>

<p>Yes. If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter, within 30 days of the date of that letter.</p>

<p>We’ll complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until the 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we have told you the outcome.</p>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we’ll ask you whether you’re willing to agree to an extension. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>We’ll write and tell you this, you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.3 </span> What to include in your request for review</h3>

<p>Your request should set out clearly the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with us and provide any supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27.4 </span> If a review is not wanted</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review, you may appeal to the independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-tax">Tribunals Service</a> within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">28. </span> Cider and perry duty — definition of cider and perry</h2>

<p>The Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 reads:</p>

<p>‘1(6) ‘Cider’ means, subject to section 55B(1) below, cider (or perry)</p>

<p>(a) which is of a strength exceeding 1.2% but less than 8.5%,</p>

<p>(b) which is obtained from the fermentation of apple or pear juice, without the addition at any time of</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) any alcoholic liquor, or</li>
  <li>(ii) any liquor or substance which communicates colour or flavour</li>
</ul>

<p>other than such as the Commissioners may allow as appearing to them to be necessary to make cider (or perry),</p>

<p>(c) the pre-fermentation mixture for which satisfies the pre-fermentation juice requirement</p>

<p>(d) which satisfies the final product juice requirement.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this subsection</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) ‘the pre-fermentation mixture’ for cider (or perry) means the mixture of juice and other ingredients in which the fermentation from which the cider (or perry) is obtained takes place, as that mixture exists immediately before the fermentation process commences</li>
  <li>(ii) if the cider (or perry) consists of a blend of 2 or more liquors constituting cider (or perry), references in this subsection to the pre-fermentation mixture are to the pre-fermentation mixtures for each of those liquors taken as a whole</li>
  <li>(iii) the pre-fermentation mixture for the cider (or perry) satisfies the pre-fermentation juice requirement if the volume of apple or pear juice of a gravity of at least 1033 degrees included in the mixture is a volume not less than 35% of the volume of the pre-fermentation mixture</li>
  <li>(iv) the cider (or perry) satisfies the final product juice requirement if the aggregate of the volume of apple or pear juice of a gravity of at least 1033 degrees included in the pre-fermentation mixture and the volume of any apple or pear juice added after fermentation commences is a volume not less than 35% of the volume of the cider (or perry)</li>
  <li>(v) the volume of any juice, the pre-fermentation mixture and the cider (or perry) is to be computed as at 20°C</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key features are:</h3>

<p>A pre-fermentation juice requirement. At least 35% apple or pear juice must be included in any mixture from which fermentation takes place.</p>

<p>A final product juice requirement. A minimum of 35% apple or pear juice must be included overall in making the final product.</p>

<p>Juice is the natural juice extract from apples or pears, but can include juice that has been diluted with water, or juice that has been concentrated or come from the dilution of concentrated juice. No other additions are allowed to juice but other ingredients may be used to make the resulting cider provided that the minimum juice content is met or exceeded in the final product.</p>

<p>Juice used both before and after fermentation begins must be of a gravity of at least 1033 degrees.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the pre-fermentation mix or for additions after fermentation has commenced it’s acceptable to dilute a higher gravity juice, to concentrate a lower gravity juice, or to add concentrated juice or a higher gravity juice to a lower gravity juice, to achieve a juice with a gravity not less than 1033 degrees.</p>

<p>The definition requires for both tests that a minimum of 35% of fruit juice is used with a minimum gravity of 1033 degrees. If a higher gravity juice is used then it’s acceptable to establish the volume in proportion to the 1033 minimum.</p>

<p>If 2 or more pre-fermentation mixes are blended, the pre-fermentation mixtures are taken as a whole for the purposes of establishing volumes and strengths. Similarly, if a cider is made by blending 2 or more ciders, the pre-fermentation mixtures for each of these ciders are taken as a whole.</p>

<p>The legislation and definition allow for the common industry practice of fermenting low gravity juice but, should the gravity of the juice lie below 1033 degrees, this liquor does not fall within the definition of cider. It may be blended before duty becomes due with other cider to produce a final cider which meets the new juice requirements.</p>

<h3>Mixture examples</h3>

<p>Cider maker has 2 ciders that are to be mixed prior to duty becoming due. One has been produced from a minimum 35% juice content with a gravity of 1031 degrees and the other has been produced from a minimum 35% juice content with a gravity of 1044 degrees. A total volume of 150 litres of mixture are required. This method also applies to mixtures for the purposes of the pre-fermentation mixture.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>The mixture is made up as follows:</p>

<p>10 litres @ 1031 degrees gravity</p>

<p>140 litres @ 1044 degrees gravity</p>

<p>(10÷150) × 1031 = 68.7</p>

<p>(140÷150) × 1044 = 974.4</p>

<p>Total = 1043.1 degrees gravity. Mixture complies since it exceeds 1033 gravity.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>The mixture is made up as follows:</p>

<p>140 litres @ 1031 degrees gravity</p>

<p>10 litres @ 1044 degrees gravity</p>

<p>(140÷150) × 1031 = 962.3</p>

<p>(10÷150) × 1044 = 69.6</p>

<p>Total = 1031.9 degrees gravity. Mixture does not comply since it is below 1033 gravity.</p>

<p>Once the above minimum gravity test has been achieved, the proportional 35% test must be carried out.</p>
