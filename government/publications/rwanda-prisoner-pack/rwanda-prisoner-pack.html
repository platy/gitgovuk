<span class="number">2. </span>Chapter 1: Key points</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">here</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Rwanda and who can help. A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody, and an online version is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rwanda-prisoner-pack">here</a>. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h4>1. Contacting us</h4>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British High Commission (and must do so if you want them to). Please note that consular assistance for British Nationals in Eswatini is provided by the British High Commission in Pretoria</li>
  <li>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British High Commission, Pretoria on +27 12 421 7500 or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the High Commission even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government, which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h4>2. Who we are</h4>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.<br>
The British High Commission in Rwanda:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

British High Commission Kigali 
<br>PO Box 576
<br>
<br>Boulevard del’ Umuganda 
<br>Kacyiru, Kigali Rwanda 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Access to the consular section is by appointment only. Please call us if you are in need of consular assistance.</p>

<p>Telephone: +250 (0)252 556000 (follow the options for emergency consular assistance to speak to an advisor 24/7)</p>

<p>Website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/rwanda">www.gov.uk/world/rwanda</a></p>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advise from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on +44(0)20 7008 5000.</p>

<h4>3. What we can do</h4>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help.  Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.</p>

<p>We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Rwanda, the authorities will normally try to tell us about your arrest within 24 hours. However, there have been times when we have received notification several days after arrest.</p>

<p>If you are arrested, you should ask the police to contact the High Commission as soon as possible after you are arrested, or ask your lawyer or family member to call us on your behalf as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eswatini-list-of-lawyers/eswatini-list-of-lawyers">list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/ letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</li>
  <li>
    <p>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>in some circumstances, be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#transfer-money">help to transfer money to you</a> from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services are not available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison</li>
  <li>generally, we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>What we can’t do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>First steps</h3>

<h4>1. Can you/ will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>2. Will the UK police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Rwanda.</p>

<h4>3. Do I need a lawyer? / How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>4. Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British. However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>5. Who else can help me?</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Rwanda</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Visits – friends and family</h3>

<h4>1. Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>Visits from family members and friends are permitted in all Rwandan correctional facilities. These take place on Fridays from 08h00 – 17h00. The visitation hours are the same for all prisons. Visits on other days are permitted upon request from the local authorities</p>

<p>Foreign visitors to Rwandan correctional facilities must apply in writing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for clearance for the visit. We strongly advise family and friends of those detained in Rwanda to contact the British High Commission for guidance – we can help you to secure clearance.</p>

<p>In order to get authorisation, foreigners are required to provide full passport details. Rwandan national visitors do not need to seek clearance. They can visit on normal visiting days and must carry their identification card. You can receive visits from family members and friends.</p>

<h4>2. What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>Visitors should expect to show their ID at the entrance and will be asked to register their names in the visitation book. A guard will be nearby during the visit and will guide you to the meeting room. Meetings usually last for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>When family members come from the UK for visits, consular staff will try to arrange extra visitation days, considering the distance families had to travel to see you. These extra days are decided by the Commissioner General of Prisons and the decision is discretionary.</p>

<p>Please check with the prison welfare officers when visits are allowed.</p>

<h4>3. What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Rwanda has several prison facilities and regulations about permitted items, which vary from one prison to another and the rules are frequently changed. Therefore, families should contact the FCDO in advance of their visit, so we can enquire from the prison authorities what will be accepted. Normally, food items and toiletries are acceptable.</p>

<h4>4. Visits – consular staff</h4>

<p>If you are sentenced, we will agree upon a visit schedule that reflects your circumstances – considering your sentence, and overall health and wellbeing. This is likely to be every 3 months. During our routine visits you will have the opportunity to discuss any health issues, wellbeing, security concerns, your treatment in prison and any other general issues that you wish to raise with our consular staff.</p>

<p>During your sentence, and with your permission, we may be in contact with your family or friends as part of providing consular assistance to you. If there is any information that you would prefer not to disclose to your family, you should let us know during the visit.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern at</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

The British High Commission, Rwanda
<br>PO BOX 576
<br>Boulevard del’ Umuganda 
<br>Kacyiru
<br>Kigali 
<br>Rwanda 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>But if it is urgent, it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf.</p>

<h4>5. Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>Emergency trips are not permitted, except for medical reasons.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>1. Arrival at the police station &amp; basic rights</h4>

<p>When you are arrested, you may be briefly held at a police station or another detention facility before being transferred to prison. Upon arrival, you should be made aware of your rights, and asked if you wish the British High Commission to be informed of your arrest.</p>

<p>At the detention centre, you will be asked to make a statement. You may be questioned further depending on the circumstances of your arrest. If you do not understand or are unable to communicate in the language the police are questioning you, the local authorities must provide an English interpreter. 
You have the right to be informed of the charges against you and to a lawyer to assist you with your statement. If you cannot afford a lawyer, the state will provide one for you to explain what you are accused of. Your statement can be made in English, French or Kinyarwanda. If you are not conversant in any of these 3 languages, you have the right to an interpreter. You should not sign anything that you cannot understand.</p>

<p>The British High Commission cannot store your personal belongings on your behalf. Your passport is usually retained at the courts until the end of your sentence.</p>

<p>The detention facility may allow you make a phone call but at your own expense. Medical checks will be carried out by the prison health department in order to assess if you need any treatment for ongoing medical conditions (e.g. blood pressure, diabetes, HIV).</p>

<h4>2. Appearance at court</h4>

<p>You may be required to speak depending on the circumstances. The state provides a detainee with a lawyer if they do not have one. If you need an interpreter at court, you will need to arrange and pay for this through your lawyer.</p>

<p>More information about the Rwandan judicial system can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#chapter-three">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<h4>3. Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>Upon arrival at the prison, you will be taken to the administration block and your personal details will be recorded in a book. Any belongings that are not part of the investigation, process, or evidence will be sent to the prison and are kept by the prison authorities.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately not unusual for some belongings to go missing right after arrest or during prison transfers.</p>

<p>Medical checks will be carried out by the prison health department in order to assess if you need any treatment for ongoing medical conditions (e.g. blood pressure, diabetes, HIV).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>Prison conditions in Rwanda can be very challenging. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are a major problem in all prisons and detention centres.</p>

<p>As a result of these challenging conditions British High Commission consular officials will usually, with your permission, seek to contact friends and family at an early stage to explore what additional support arrangements can be made for prisoners.</p>

<p>The British High Commission is unable to provide this support directly, although we will do what we can to support families get suitable arrangements in place.</p>

<h4>1. Accommodation</h4>

<p>Overcrowding is a huge problem. The number of inmates to each cell entirely depends on the size of the cell and the number of prisoners in the prison. The condition of toilets and showers are poor.</p>

<p>Some prisons are unisex but with separate wings for men and women, the latter being supervised by female staff.</p>

<h4>2. Food and diet</h4>

<p>Any incarcerated person in Rwandan correctional facilities has the right to a sufficient daily ratio of food with a balanced nutritional value, as well as adequate clean drinking water. These are provided by the local authorities.</p>

<p>According to Rwandan policy, the diet must have at least 2100 calories composed of cereal, leguminous, salt, oil and other vital food. A special diet can only be provided on medical grounds (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure) and not on religious grounds. You can supplement your diet by buying fruit and other food items from the prison canteen.</p>

<p>In all prisons you will be given 2 basic meals a day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>breakfast – maize or sorghum porridge</li>
  <li>lunch/ dinner – ugali (maize meal) and beans</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that no meat is provided by the prison authorities, but you can purchase meat at the prison canteen.</p>

<h4>3. Hygiene</h4>

<p>In Rwandan correctional facilities, there are basic washing facilities, and it is possible to shower every day. Hot water is generally not available. Basic toiletries, including soap and toothpaste are not provided. The crowded prison environment and humidity can encourage illness to spread.</p>

<h4>4. Work and study</h4>

<p>Correctional facilities have rehabilitation programmes to enable inmates to acquire skills and act as a source of income. These include construction, carpentry and crafts. If you express interest, sometimes training will be offered and thereafter you are paid a commission from the sales you make. It is difficult for prisons to provide work for all prisoners, but opportunities exist.</p>

<p>Study opportunities are sometimes available but may vary from correctional facility to correctional facility. Your Correctional Director (the person in charge of your prison) should be able to advise what opportunities are available. Some, but not all, facilities have study rooms and often have libraries with limited books available. Pens and paper are provided, but resources are limited.</p>

<p>You could be expected to work either in the prison or on the outside. Prisoners’ work ranges from construction and road sweeping to working in the prison kitchen. Prison authorities keep most of your earnings as a contribution to your up-keep.</p>

<h4>5. Contact and languages</h4>

<p>English is spoken less commonly than French or Kinyarwanda, so you may want to learn French and Kinyarwanda. This will help you to communicate your needs and ease the boredom and mental isolation of prison life.</p>

<p>Nyarugenge Prison (Mageragere) offers English lessons for inmates. Local language materials may be available from Prisoners Abroad.</p>

<h4>6. Exercise</h4>

<p>Exercise is encouraged in Rwandan prisons. You are free to walk around the prison compound all day and on occasion, prisoners are taken out to play soccer or basketball.</p>

<h4>7. Climate</h4>
<p>The climate is very different to that of the UK. It can be very hot and humid during rainy season (September-May) and cool during dry season (June-August). Apart from prison uniforms, prisons in Rwanda do not provide any other kind of clothes.</p>

<h4>8. Religion</h4>

<p>Prisoners are free to take part in religious services of their choice.</p>

<h4>9. Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>Drugs that are illegal in the UK are illegal in Rwanda. Use and sale of illegal drugs in Rwanda is however widespread, including in prisons. If you are caught with illegal substances, you will be punished according to prison regulations, which could include solitary confinement. Tobacco cigarettes are not allowed inside Rwandan correctional facilities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>1. How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are 2 ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Private Funds: deposited to you by your family or friends. See Annex for instructions on how to send funds.</li>
  <li>Prisoners Abroad: depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).</li>
</ol>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>
</div>

<h4>2. Private funds</h4>

<p>While the Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to arrange this. We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h4>3. Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>Prisoners in Rwanda are eligible for the Prisoners Abroad medical fund and the vitamin fund if they cannot afford their own vitamins.</p>

<h4>4. Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, Rwanda is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.</p>

<p>Concerning the healthcare of inmates, every inmate in Rwanda correctional facilities has the same right to medical care as any other citizen. Free medical treatment is provided through the program known as ‘mutuelle de santé’.</p>

<p>Every prison has an infirmary where patients receive medical care and that collaborates with the health centres near the prison. If you cannot receive medical care at the prison, you will be transferred to another health centre.</p>

<p>Upon admission to the correctional facility, you will be examined by a doctor for any contagious diseases and broader medical needs. If you are diagnosed with a contagious disease, you will be transferred to a hospital isolation ward to receive healthcare to protect other people from contamination.</p>

<p>The prison medical will examine issues relating to disease, hygiene and nutritional status. They will inform the prison management in writing of any relevant matters that need to be addressed.</p>

<p>If you need medical or dental treatment, you should ask to see the prison doctor or nurse. Basic medical attention is free of charge. There are no resident prison doctors, but nurses are present every day and a doctor visits prisons daily from the nearest hospital.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that a doctor who speaks English will treat you. If the doctor is unable to treat you, you will be sent to the nearest local hospital. If you do not understand the doctor, you are encouraged to ask a trusted member of the prison staff to provide translation for you. If you need specialist medication or complex treatment, you will be expected to pay all associated costs.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<p>HIV/ AIDS is a significant problem in prisons. If you have a long-standing medical problem and have received treatment for it in the UK, it may be useful if you have your medical records, or at least a report, sent from your doctor to the medical doctor treating you in the detention centre. With your permission, we can help to link up your doctor in the UK with your doctor in prison, as this is part of the assistance we can offer.</p>

<h4>5. Mail/ parcels</h4>

<p>There is usually no limit to the number of letters you may send or receive. The authorities are obliged to deliver letters with the minimum of delay. Please be aware that all letters and parcels are opened and checked by prison staff before they are given to detained persons.</p>

<p>You can receive parcels from your family with permission from the Director of the Correctional Facility.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please be aware that parcels should be sent directly to the prison; we cannot give you parcels sent to the High Commission.</p>
</div>

<p>The Correctional Facility Authorities will direct you on how to send and receive parcels. Parcels should have the name and details of the sender.  The sender must be registered with the correctional facility authorities or the parcel will be refused.</p>

<p>All letters and parcels will be sent through:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
 
Rwanda Correctional Services 
<br>P O Box 6516  
<br>Kigali   
<br>Rwanda 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Remember your family/ friends should add your name and the name of the correctional services you are located.</p>
</div>

<p>On exceptional circumstances, if your family is not in country and they wish to pass an urgent message to you on compassionate grounds, they could email your letter to the Rwandan Correctional Circumstances. Their email address is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@rcs.gov.rw">info@rcs.gov.rw</a>. Note that the letter would be read/ scanned before passing it to you.</p>

<h4>6. Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>You will not have regular access to a telephone and will not be permitted to have a mobile phone. Rwandan law states detainees cannot have access to phones and you will not be allowed to make phone calls while in detention. If you are caught trying to use a mobile phone inside the prison you will be punished according to the prison’s regulations. These punishments include, but are not limited to, losing employment and education privileges, and solitary confinement.</p>

<p>On exceptional occasions you could request a phone call to your family by writing to the Director of Correctional Services and on his discretion, you may be granted to make a call. All calls would take place under supervision.</p>

<h4>7. How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform consular staff as soon as you can and it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaint’s procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider.</p>

<p>With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible, photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Chapter 3: The Rwandan judicial system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>1. Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>The constitution of the Republic of Rwanda entrusts the judiciary with the mission of protection of rights. The judiciary is composed of ordinary courts and specialized courts. The High Council of the Judiciary is the supreme governing organ of the judiciary.</p>

<p>Ordinary courts are comprised of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supreme Court</li>
  <li>Court of Appeal</li>
  <li>High Court</li>
  <li>Intermediate Courts</li>
  <li>Primary Courts</li>
</ul>

<p>Specialised courts cover commercial and military matters.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>
</div>

<h4>2. What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>When you are arrested in Rwanda, you are normally initially taken to a detention centre. Upon arrival, you are taken to an administration block where your personal details are recorded. Any belongings you have that are not part of the investigation process will be kept by the local authorities. The rest will be sent to the detention centre for safe keeping.</p>

<p>It is usual for belongings to go missing right after arrest or during prison transfers. If you are unable to locate your belongings, ask the police department as they do at times hold some items/ belongings as evidence.</p>

<p>The British High Commission cannot store your personal belongings for you. The local authorities will normally retain your passport at the courts until the end of your sentence. The British High Commission can help you recover your passport if it is not immediately returned to you on your release.</p>

<p>You have the right to be informed of the exact charges against you and to call a lawyer of your choice. You are also entitled to an interpreter at your initial detention to help you understand if the charges are made in a language that you do not speak. You should never sign anything you do not understand.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rwanda-list-of-lawyers">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>3. For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>In Rwanda you can be held in the police station for 72 hours. After this, you will either be released, or your case is transferred to the prosecutor’s office, which has an additional 5 days (Article 37 of the Penal Procedure Code) to present your case to a judge.</p>

<p>The judge will decide whether to release you with an “ordonance de liberté” (subject to conditions) or detain you (in prison) with an “ordonance de detention” for a period of one month. After a month, you again will be brought before the judge.</p>

<p>The judge can extend your period for another 30 days if the case is still being investigated with no trial date set. Pre-trial investigation, and subsequent detention, can be very lengthy</p>

<h4>4. What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>You will either be freed until your case is heard or you will be remanded in custody. The judge decides on your status, i.e. liberty or detention. If freed, you must remain in Rwanda. Your passport will be confiscated and you may be asked to report weekly to a police station.</p>

<p>At your first hearing before a court, you should be notified of your rights. In theory, these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the right to an interpreter (although you may need to arrange and pay for this through your lawyer)</li>
  <li>the right to consult a lawyer (see below)</li>
  <li>the right to appeal against a charge</li>
  <li>the right to be visited at a reasonable time by consular staff, and by members of your family</li>
  <li>the right to be examined by a doctor, if unwell</li>
</ul>

<p>If the judge agrees to release you on bail, you will be informed about the terms and conditions, which normally include surrendering your passport to the local authorities. If bail is refused, you will be transferred to a prison on remand awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Bail and detention terms vary according to the alleged offence, for example, under Rwandan law serious crimes such as drugs trafficking have no provision for bail.</p>

<h4>5. What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>The decision rests with the judge. You will have to surrender your passport to the Rwandan authorities to prevent you from leaving the country. If you do leave the country, the guarantor must forfeit the bail set by the judge, and other penalties may apply. The guarantor must pay compensation for any damages caused by the accused</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>1. What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, you can access a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rwanda-list-of-lawyers">list of English-speaking lawyers online</a>. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>A list of English-speaking private lawyers will be given to you by a consular officer. Sometimes private lawyers may ask for a cash advance for their estimated legal fees before they take your case on.</p>

<p>The High Commission cannot pay legal fees or guarantee to a lawyer that you will pay them. If you cannot pay for a lawyer, you can request assistance from the court, who will write to the Rwanda Bar Association to ask if they are able to provide a lawyer for free. This process is slow and may not result in you being offered a lawyer for free.</p>

<h4>2. What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>On your trial day you will be taken to the court where your case is being handled. There will be a judge in charge of your case, along with the public prosecutor and your lawyer (if you have one). If you don’t speak Kinyarwanda, the court must provide you with an interpreter but you may need to pay for this.</p>

<h4>3. Sentences</h4>

<p>Sentences will vary depending on the charge. Your lawyer should be able to advise you about length of sentences and, if appropriate, about appeal processes.</p>

<p>If you are found guilty and sentenced, you could be taken to any of the 17 correctional facilities in Rwanda. As a foreigner, you will most likely be sent to Nyarugenge Prison located in Mageragere, in the capital, Kigali.</p>

<p>There is no death penalty. The death penalty was abolished in July 2007.</p>

<p>Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Rwanda are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.</p>

<h4>4. How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>The following persons may lodge an appeal</p>

<ul>
  <li>you or your lawyer (for the person facing charges)</li>
  <li>the person liable to pay damages</li>
  <li>the civil party or persons who have been automatically awarded damages (civil claims only)</li>
  <li>the prosecution</li>
</ul>

<p>An appeal should be lodged within 30 days of the judgment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>1. What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>Parole, known as conditional release in Rwanda, is possible. You must serve at least one quarter of the sentence before it will be considered. Parole will be considered for good behaviour or if you suffer from serious and incurable diseases diagnosed by 3 doctors.</p>

<p>Parole conditions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are serving up to 5 years, parole will be considered after serving a third of your sentence.</li>
  <li>If you are serving more than 5 years, parole will be considered after two thirds of the sentence has been served.</li>
  <li>If you are serving a life term, parole will be considered after 20 years. Parole can be revoked.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will not be considered for parole if you are guilty of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>genocide or crimes against humanity</li>
  <li>terrorism, sexual violence against children, treason, or espionage</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>You can write a letter to The President of the Republic of Rwanda requesting a pardon. You may or may not get a response. It is at the discretion of the President to grant this pardon. The President of the Republic of Rwanda is the only person who can grant clemency.</p>

<h4>3. What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>Financial penalties/ fines and court fees must be paid to a court clerk within 8 days of the court judgement.</p>

<p>Rwandan law allows for financial penalties, rather than custodial sentencing, depending on the crime committed. Your lawyer will be able to advise on financial penalties as some of these are already set by the judicial system.</p>

<p>If you do not fully cover any financial penalties, you could be sentenced to further detention, or released on bail but not allowed to leave the country.</p>

<h4>4. Is transfer to another prison within Rwanda possible?</h4>

<p>Yes. You will have to put your request in writing with the reasons (e.g. compassionate grounds) to the Director of the Rwandan Correctional Facilities. The decision to move prisoners is at the discretion of the local authorities. Depending on the reasons for your request, we may be able to make representations to the authorities on your behalf.</p>

<p>The prison health department might carry out medical checks following your arrest.  You should ensure you make them aware of any medical conditions you might have.</p>

<h4>5. Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>Yes. There is Prisoner Transfer Agreement between Rwanda and the United Kingdom. More information can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreement-between-the-uk-and-rwanda-on-the-transfer-of-sentenced-persons">here</a>.</p>

<p>To transfer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)</li>
  <li>not be awaiting trial</li>
  <li>have exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/ or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal</li>
  <li>have at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer</li>
  <li>have no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties</li>
</ul>

<p>The offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The authorities in Rwanda may refuse your request. You should be aware that even if the sentencing state agrees to your transfer, the UK authorities may refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family residents there.</p>

<h4>6. What are the procedures for release?</h4>

<p>All applications for release are addressed to the Director of the Correctional Services in charge of a prison. This application is as a result of a court order releasing you on bail or acquittal from a sentence.</p>

<p>After you have served your sentence, you will be released and you will have to book your own accommodation. You will also have to book your own ticket to go back to your country of residence (if you are not a resident in Rwanda).</p>

<p>You should present your plane ticket to Rwandan immigration so they are able to return your passport to you as you depart from the airport.</p>

<h4>7. What are the procedures for deportation?</h4>

<p>The Interior Minister and Director of Immigration can deport foreign nationals deemed undesirable, or who could compromise or threaten national security or public order. It is not automatic for foreign nationals who have completed a prison sentence in Rwanda, instead it is decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on the crimes committed.</p>

<p>After being declared undesirable, foreign nationals can be sentenced to between 8 and 15 days in prison and fined. All foreigners who enter or remain in Rwanda illegally can be deported with no legal recourse. Deportation would be through the courts and immigration authorities in hand with the Correctional Services. This would happen after a person has served his/ her sentence within the country.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad, you can visit them when you first arrive back in the UK to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask for advice</li>
  <li>take a shower</li>
  <li>use their temporary luggage store</li>
  <li>make essential phone calls</li>
  <li>use a computer</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have no belongings, Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance, it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency. Other sources of practical help back in the UK are The Salvation Army – UK Helpline 020 7367 4888, Monday to Friday 08h00 to 16h00, or contact your local Salvation Army branch – and The Prison Fellowship, UK Helpline 020 7799 2500, Monday to Friday 09h00 to 17h00.</p>

<h4>8. Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<span class="number">5.1 </span>Additional Information</h3>

<h4>1. Prisoners Abroad</h4>
