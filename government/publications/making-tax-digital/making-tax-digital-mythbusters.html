<p>Since 2019 businesses above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold are required to keep their records digitally and submit their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return using compatible software.</p>

<h2>Myths</h2>

<h3>Under Making Tax Digital (<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>) for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>, businesses will have to provide more information than they already do</h3>

<p>This is not correct: no business will need to provide information to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> more regularly than they do now, nor send any additional information.</p>

<h3>Businesses above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold can choose not to join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and continue to submit returns as they always have done.</h3>

<p>This is not correct: businesses above the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold were required to join <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> and submit their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns using the new service for their first <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> period which began on or after 1 April 2019.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022, all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses will be required to use <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> no matter what they earn.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> won’t reduce errors</h3>

<p>This is not correct: keeping records on paper and submitting <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> manually results in errors
– in a YouGov poll 61% of businesses said they have previously lost receipts– and errors also occur in the manual transposition of data and manual calculations.</p>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> offers a more integrated approach to business administration and tax, reducing the time businesses spend on administration in the longer term and making it easier for them to get their tax right.</p>

<p>An independent evaluation of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>’s impact on record-keeping behaviour and scope for error among small businesses published in March 2020 found that that businesses that subscribed to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> with fully integrated accounting and tax software reported spending less time on their tax.</p>

<h3>The cost and admin burdens of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> are prohibitive for most businesses</h3>

<p>This is not correct: there are <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible solutions available at no or low cost for most businesses, including free products (with varying conditions of use).</p>

<p>Costs will differ from business to business and are influenced by the size and complexity of the business and their degree of digital capability, as well as the type of functionality they want their software to include. Most businesses will be able to claim any costs for hardware and software against their tax.</p>

<p><abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> also provides many wider benefits to business and our <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> case studies (available on our YouTube and GOV.UK channels) feature some of the benefits businesses have experienced from making the move to digital record keeping.</p>

<h3>Small businesses should be automatically exempt</h3>

<p>This is not correct: the smallest businesses are currently exempt from <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> but can join voluntarily.</p>

<p>Around a quarter of businesses below the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> threshold have already chosen to sign up and experience the benefits digital record keeping has to offer, in advance of <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> being extended to those below the threshold in April 2022.</p>

<p>Businesses that cannot go digital will not be required to do so.</p>

<h3>Eventually you will not be able to use spreadsheets or bridging software under <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>
</h3>

<p>This is not correct: businesses can choose to use spreadsheets to both maintain digital records and perform tax calculations, provided the spreadsheets combine with some form of ‘bridging’ software that will allow their <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return data to be sent to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> from the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>However, users will get the maximum benefits from <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> – fewer errors, increased productivity and better financial planning by using dedicated <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> software which provides an efficient end-to-end experience with a return submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> at the touch of a button</p>
