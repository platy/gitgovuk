<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We provided £1.5 billion a year to schools and local authorities through the teachers’ pension employer contribution grant (<abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr>) and supplementary fund. This funding was to cover the cost of the increase in the employer contribution rate of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Teacher’s Pension Scheme">TPS</abbr>) from 16.4% to 23.6%, from September 2019.</p>

<p>From 2021 to 2022 financial year, the majority of the funding for the increase in pension costs was paid through the schools, high needs and central school services block (<abbr title="central school services block">CSSB</abbr>) national funding formulae (<abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr>), instead of as separate grants. This methodology document sets out how allocations were calculated before this point for all schools, and after that point, how the remaining allocations have been calculated.</p>

<p>We have published allocations for financial years <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2019-to-2020-allocations">2019 to 2020</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2020-to-2021-allocations">2020 to 2021</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2021-to-2022-allocations">2021 to 2022</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-2022-to-2023-allocations">2022 to 2023</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding for increase in pension costs before 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Teacher’s Pension Scheme">TPS</abbr> data did not give us information about individual schools’ contributions to the scheme since most schools are part of a local authority or multi-academy trust. Therefore, to match the funding as closely as we could to costs, we allocated the <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> using a per-pupil formula. The methodology we used is explained in this document.</p>

<p>Schools and local authorities (on behalf of their high needs institutions) also received payments from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-supplementary-fund/pension-supplementary-fund-and-funding-for-local-authority-centrally-employed-teachers-and-music-education-hubs">supplementary fund</a>, which supports schools that have faced unusually high pension costs. These were based on the claims, submitted and paid, for the academic year 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>Local authorities received <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-supplementary-fund/pension-supplementary-fund-and-funding-for-local-authority-centrally-employed-teachers-and-music-education-hubs">pension funding for centrally employed teachers (<abbr title="centrally employed teachers">CETs</abbr>)</a>, and music education hubs that are not part of a local authority received <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-pension-grant-supplementary-fund/pension-supplementary-fund-and-funding-for-local-authority-centrally-employed-teachers-and-music-education-hubs">funding for their directly employed teachers</a>, based on the information they submitted on the total cost of the increase for their teachers in the academic year 2019 to 2020. We did not run a new claims process for the supplementary fund, centrally employed teachers or music education hubs.</p>

<h2>Transition to the national funding formulae in 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>From 2021 to 2022,  the majority of the funding for the increase in pension costs has been paid through the schools, high needs and central school services block (<abbr title="central school services block">CSSB</abbr>) national funding formulae (<abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr>), instead of as separate grants.</p>

<p>We have ensured that the additional funding schools attract through the <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> is as close as possible to the funding they would have received if the funding was continuing as separate grants, without adding significant complexity to the formulae:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the schools <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr>, we added an amount to reflect the current <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> funding onto the basic per-pupil units and the minimum per pupil funding levels - we also added an amount, representing the funding schools receive through the <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> and supplementary fund, for their reception to year 11 pupils onto the baselines used to calculate minimum increases in funding</li>
  <li>in the high needs <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr>, we increased the basic entitlement factor value for special schools and created an additional factor through which local authorities will receive the equivalent of their 2020 to 2021 <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> for alternative provision settings and supplementary funding</li>
</ul>

<p>It is our expectation that, from the 2021 to 2022 financial year, local authorities should pass on to individual schools the amount of additional funding they received through the 2020 to 2021 <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr>, as far as possible.</p>

<p>More details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-for-schools-and-high-needs"><abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> policy document</a>.</p>

<p>The table summarises when schools and local authorities received their final remaining allocations for <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr>, supplementary funding, and pension funding for centrally employed teachers (<abbr title="centrally employed teachers">CETs</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Funding outside of the NFFs in 2021 to 2022</h3>

<p>In the 2021 to 2022 financial year, we continued to provide the following institutions with the teachers’ pension employer contribution grant, paid separately to core allocations, as they were not funded through the NFFs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained nursery schools and school nurseries</li>
  <li>sixth forms and 16 to 19 schools</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>new special and alternative provision free schools opened after 1 September 2020 and too late to be included in the DSG allocations for financial year 2021-22. As for other special and AP schools, this funding was paid to local authorities for them to pass on to the schools in their area</li>
</ul>

<p>The grant was paid based on the per pupil rates set out in this document. Allocations for April to August 2021 were published in April 2021 and allocations for the second half of the financial year were published in October 2021.</p>

<h3>Funding outside of the NFFs in 2022 to 2023</h3>
<p>In the 2022 to 2023 financial year, we will continue to provide the following institutions with the teachers’ pension employer contribution grant, paid separately to core allocations, as they are not funded through their NFFs or core allocations.</p>

<p>For the full 2022 to 2023 financial year, we will provide maintained nursery schools and school nurseries with the early years element of the teachers’ pension employer contribution grant, paid separately to core allocations.</p>

<p>For the full 2022 to 2023 financial year, we will provide sixth forms and 16-19 schools the post-16 element of the teachers’ pension employer contribution grant, paid separately to core allocations.</p>

<p>For non-maintained special schools, we will provide funding for April to August 2022, in the same way as the previous <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr>. From September 2022, we are planning to pay NMSS the equivalent funding through their main high needs funding allocations.</p>

<p>The grant will be paid based on the per pupil rates set out in this document. Allocations for April to August 2022 are published in April 2022, and allocations for the second half of the financial year are published in October 2022.</p>

<p>For new special and AP free schools open after September 2021, whose place numbers and pupil numbers were not available in time for the DSG high needs block update in December 2021, local authorities will receive the equivalent of the <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> for 2022 to 2023 via adjustments to the DSG in July 2022 or November 2022. These are not included in the allocations for the <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> in 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>For more information on high needs funding, and how LAs should be pass on the DSG funding to their schools, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance">High needs funding: 2022 to 2023 operational guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> methodology</h2>

<p>This section sets out the eligibility criteria for the grant.</p>

<h3>Mainstream institutions</h3>

<p>The grant eligibility before 2021 to 2022 was based on the number of pupils aged 2 to 19 in these categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained nursery schools</li>
  <li>primary, secondary and all through maintained schools</li>
  <li>primary, secondary and all through academies and free schools</li>
  <li>16 to 19 maintained schools</li>
  <li>16 to 19 academies</li>
</ul>

<p>In the 2022 to 2023 financial year institutions and age ranges funded outside of the schools <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> will continue to be eligible for the grant (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#fund">Funding outside of the NFFs in 2022 to 2023</a>).</p>

<p>For mainstream institutions with fewer than 100 pupils, funding is allocated as if they had 100 pupils. This will account for all eligible pupils.</p>

<h3>Specialist institutions</h3>

<p>The grant eligibility before 2021 to 2022 was based on the number of places in these categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained special schools</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies and free schools</li>
  <li>hospital schools</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Specialist institutions not funded through the high needs <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> (non-maintained special schools and new special and alternative provision free schools) continued to receive these grants separately in the 2021 to 2022 financial year.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023 financial year non-maintained special schools will be included in the April to August allocations. For new special and AP free schools open after September 2021, whose place numbers and pupil numbers were not available in time for the DSG high needs block update in December 2021, local authorities will receive the equivalent of the <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> for 2022 to 2023 via adjustments to the DSG in July 2022 or November 2022.</p>

<p>For specialist institutions with fewer than 40 places, funding is allocated as if they had 40 places. This will account for all eligible pupils.</p>

<h3>Independent settings</h3>

<p>We provided funding to local authorities for pupils with education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr>) plans, or SEN support, who are educated in independent settings, based on the number of such pupils for whom they commissioned places. From 2021-2022 this has been included in the basic entitlement factor funding in the high needs <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Paying the grant</h2>

<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) pays the funding for maintained mainstream schools to local authorities, who are required to pay it to individual schools at the rates published.</p>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> pays funding at the published rates directly to mainstream academies.</p>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> pays funding to local authorities to distribute, according to local circumstance, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>institutions who provide for children with high needs</li>
  <li>pupils with <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plans who are educated in independent settings</li>
</ul>

<p>The exception to this is non-maintained special schools. <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> allocates funding directly to non-maintained special schools.</p>

<h2>How we calculated the rates</h2>

<p>From September 2019 the employer contribution rate of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Teacher’s Pension Scheme">TPS</abbr>) increased from 16.4% to 23.6%.</p>

<p>We calculated the total cost of this increase to schools, and local authorities (for their centrally employed teachers), to be £848 million from September 2019 to March 2020 and made this amount of funding available. Before dividing this funding, we set aside £22 million, in order to provide money for the supplementary fund.</p>

<h3>How we divided the funding between sectors</h3>

<p>We divided the total amount between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary schools (including early years provision in primary schools, and maintained nursery schools)</li>
  <li>secondary schools (including school sixth forms)</li>
  <li>high needs institutions</li>
  <li>local authority centrally employed teachers</li>
</ul>

<p>We did this based on the size of the teacher wage bill for each sector. This is to account, for example, that high needs institutions generally spend more on staff per pupil.</p>

<p>We then divided the amount of funding for primary schools, secondary schools and high needs institutions between the number of pupils or places, to generate a per-pupil or per-place rate.</p>

<p>We assumed that all:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream schools have at least 100 pupils</li>
  <li>high needs institutions have at least 40 places</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also providing funding to local authorities for pupils, with <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plans or SEN support, educated in independent settings, at the rate for special schools.</p>

<h3>Pupil numbers used to calculate the rates</h3>

<p>We used this data to calculate the rates ahead of the first set of allocations for the grant in autumn 2019.</p>

<h4>Mainstream schools</h4>

<h3>Adjusting for location</h3>

<p>We apply an area cost adjustment (<abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr>), which takes into account higher teacher wages in London.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="area cost adjustment">ACA</abbr> uses 4 rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inner London</li>
  <li>outer London</li>
  <li>London fringe</li>
  <li>the rest of England</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rates</h2>

<p>The rates have remained the same since the grant was established in September 2019.</p>

<p>Rates for the 5-month period from April to August have been calculated as five-sevenths of the 7-month rates for September to March.</p>

<h2>How we calculate allocations</h2>

<p>To calculate a school’s grant, we take the relevant rate and multiply it by the school’s pupil numbers from the latest version of the sources in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#rates">rates section</a>.</p>

<h3>Early years and post 16 allocations</h3>

<p>Schools continue to be funded based on the 100 minimum pupils. However, now funding for 5 to 16 year olds has been rolled into the National Funding Formula (<abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr>), any school that has pupils in the October 2021 census data is deemed to have already been funded for at least 100 places minimum, due to the operation of the <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> funding floor.</p>

<p>In order to work out the number of early years/post 16 pupils to be funded the following calculations are undertaken.</p>

<p>Where the October 2021 census 5 to 16 year old pupil count is greater than 0, the eligible early years or post 16 student count for the school is added to the October 2021 census 5 to 16 year old pupil count. If this total is less than 100 then the school does not receive a <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> allocation (for their early years/post 16 pupils) as they are deemed to have been funded for the minimum 100 pupils in their <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> funding.</p>

<p>Where the October 2021 census 5 to 16 year old pupil count is less than 100, but the October census count plus the eligible early years or post 16 student count is greater than 100, the school is funded for the extra pupils over the minimum of 100, for example October census count plus eligible pupil count, less the 100 pupil minimum.</p>

<p>Where the October 2021 census 5 to 16 year old pupil count is 0 and the eligible early years pupil or post 16 student count is less than 100 the school is funded on the 100 minimum.</p>

<p>Where the October 2021 census 5 to 16 year old pupil count is greater than 100 the school is funded based on their eligible October 2021 census 5 to 16 year old pupil count.</p>

<h3>Non-maintained Special Schools allocations</h3>

<p>Non-maintained special schools are also outside of the <abbr title="national funding formulae">NFF</abbr> and will be funded directly by the <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>. The schools are funded based on their total funded place numbers.</p>

<p>Schools are funded based on their place numbers as above, or on a minimum of 40 places, whichever is higher.</p>

<h2>Multi-academy trust pooling</h2>

<p>As the <abbr title="teachers' pension employer contribution grant">TPECG</abbr> and supplementary fund are intended to support costs which are normally funded through the general annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>), a multi-academy trust (<abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>) should treat the grant in the same way as they would <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>, in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook">Academies Trust Handbook</a>. This means they may amalgamate grant payments for its academies to form one central fund, on the same basis as <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. This can be used to meet the running costs at any constituent academies within the trust.</p>

<p>As with <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> pooling, we would expect the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> to consider the funding needs and allocations of each constituent academy, and to have an appeals mechanism. An appeals mechanism should allow an academy to appeal to the trust if a constituent academy’s principal feels the academy has been unfairly treated. If the grievance is not resolved, then we would expect the mechanism to include the option of appealing to the Secretary of State, via <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, whose decision would be final.</p>
