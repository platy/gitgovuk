<p>The school rebuilding programme carries out major rebuilding and refurbishment projects at school and sixth-form college buildings across England, with buildings prioritised according to their condition.</p>

<h2>Confirmed projects</h2>

<p>There are currently 161 projects in the programme. We announced the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-first-50-schools">first 50 schools in the programme</a> in February 2021, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools">second set of 50 schools</a> in July 2021, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-2022-to-2023-approved-schoolse">third set of 61 schools in July 2022</a>.</p>

<p>These schools were prioritised because they met one or more of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have buildings of specific construction types that require replacement</li>
  <li>their buildings have the highest condition need, identified in data collected in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-data-collection-programme-information-and-guidance">condition data collection</a> (<abbr title="condition data collection">CDC</abbr>) and verified through collecting additional condition information</li>
  <li>their buildings have severe and urgent condition need that meant they were a high priority for replacement</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about how we prioritised schools in the published methodology notes for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-first-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-methodology-for-prioritising-the-first-50-projects">first 50 schools</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-methodology-for-prioritising-the-second-set-of-50-schools">second set of 50 schools</a> and further information below about the ongoing selection process from which the 61 schools were prioritised.</p>

<h2>Ongoing 2022 to 2023 prioritisation process</h2>

<p>We consulted the school sector on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/prioritising-schools-for-the-school-rebuilding-programme">approach to prioritising schools for the future places in the programme</a> between 19 July and 8 October 2021. The government’s response to the consultation has been published and the approach we have adopted for the current selection process is based on the feedback received in the consultation.</p>

<p>We launched a nomination process in early 2022 which closed at the end of March 2022. We received nominations for 1,105 schools.</p>

<p>The assessment of nominations is ongoing. We announced a group of 61 schools in July 2022 to maintain the pace of delivery and address some of the poorest condition buildings as soon as possible. These were identified from nominations using <abbr title="condition data collection">CDC</abbr> data, in a similar way to round 2, applying <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-methodology-for-prioritising-the-second-set-of-50-schools">that methodology</a> to the buildings nominated at each school. The condition of buildings was verified through site visits. We are still assessing all other nominations received and have not ruled out any nominated schools from selection at this point.</p>

<p>We plan to confirm another set of prioritised schools before the end of this financial year, prioritising up to 300 schools in total in 2022 to 2023. Schools prioritised will be informed that they have been provisionally allocated a place on the programme, subject to further due diligence, and projects will then be scheduled for delivery over the coming years.</p>

<h2>Future prioritisation rounds</h2>

<p>There are places reserved for later in the programme, following the completion of this prioritisation round. Details of any future rounds will be confirmed in future years.</p>

<h2>Equalities impact assessment</h2>

<p>We have also published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-equalities-impact-assessment">equalities impact assessment</a>, covering the impact of our selection approach on school building users with protected characteristics.</p>

<h2>Urgent and severe building condition issues</h2>

<p>Responsible bodies have a responsibility for the safety and maintenance of the buildings in their care. If a responsible body has urgent and severe condition need that it is unable to resolve, it should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education" rel="external">contact the Department for Education (DfE)</a> for advice.</p>
