<p>The School Rebuilding Programme carries out major rebuilding and refurbishment projects at school and sixth form college buildings across England, with buildings prioritised according to their condition.</p>

<h2>Current confirmed schools</h2>

<p>There are currently 100 projects in the programme. We announced the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-first-50-schools">first 50 schools in the programme</a> in February 2021 and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools">second set of 50 schools</a> in July 2021.</p>

<p>The first 100 schools were prioritised either because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have buildings of specific construction types that require replacement</li>
  <li>their buildings have the highest condition need, identified in data collected in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/condition-data-collection-programme-information-and-guidance">Condition Data Collection</a> and verified through collecting additional condition information</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about how we prioritised schools in the published methodology notes for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-first-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-methodology-for-prioritising-the-first-50-projects">first 50 schools</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-second-set-of-50-schools/school-rebuilding-programme-methodology-for-prioritising-the-second-set-of-50-schools">second set of 50 schools</a>.</p>

<h2>Prioritisation of schools for future projects</h2>

<p>We consulted the school sector on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/prioritising-schools-for-the-school-rebuilding-programme">approach to prioritising schools for the future places in the programme</a> between 19 July and 8 October 2021. The government’s response to the consultation has now been published and the approach we have adopted for the current selection process is based on the feedback received in the consultation.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, the programme expects to prioritise up to 300 schools, reserving the remaining places for later in the programme. Schools selected will be informed that they have been provisionally allocated a place on the programme, subject to further due diligence, and projects will then enter delivery at a rate of 50 per year.</p>

<p>The latest nomination round has now closed. We will announce the schools selected from this round in due course.</p>

<p>We have also published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme-equalities-impact-assessment">equalities impact assessment</a>, covering the impact of our selection approach on school building users with protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Responsible bodies have a responsibility for the safety and maintenance of the buildings in their care. If a responsible body has urgent and severe condition need that it is unable to resolve, it should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education" rel="external">contact the Department for Education (DfE)</a> for advice.</p>
