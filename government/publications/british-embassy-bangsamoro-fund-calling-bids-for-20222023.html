<p>As part of the UK government’s continued commitment to provide support to the Bangsamoro peace process, the British Embassy Manila is seeking bids for projects under its Conflict, Stability and Security Fund. This is a three-year programme (2022-2025), with a funding allocation secured for 2022-2023. The core elements of the Programme are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>capacity building programmes for officials in the BTA to strengthen its democratic functions and governing capability;</li>
  <li>strengthening inclusion and representation of women in political decision making / supporting women’s participation in post-conflict governance; and</li>
  <li>strengthening community engagement through public awareness campaigns about the new Parliamentary system and voting rights (including marginalized and excluded groups from political processes - youth, women, IPs).</li>
</ol>

<p>Project proposals are now being sought for projects under objectives two and three above.</p>

<p>All bids should be in Pounds Sterling (GBP) and cover the period May 2022 to March 2023. Outline plans on longer term activity until 2025 are welcome. Bidders are strongly advised to limit their proposals within the following indicative funding brackets for 2022/23:</p>

<ol>
  <li>£500,000 for Objective 2; and</li>
  <li>£500,000 for Objective 3</li>
</ol>

<h3>Approval Process</h3>

<p>Project bids will be shortlisted and approved by the British Embassy Manila’s Programme Board. To apply for funding, interested organisations must submit a Concept Note to the CSSF Programme Manager (details below). The concept note provides the information required to enable programme team to make an initial assessment of whether the bidder will qualify for the second round of selection.</p>

<p>If the Project Concept Note is successful in the first selection phase, the implementer will be asked to submit a full proposal and an activity-based budget (ABB). There is likely to be a short turnaround time for this. The full proposal will then be submitted to the Embassy Programme Board and the FCDO in London.</p>

<h3>Managerial and Financial Aspects</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Any organisation can apply for funding. We do not accept project bids submitted by individuals.</li>
  <li>Please note that payment will be made in arrears. We cannot make pre-payments; successful bidders should make payments and be reimbursed by the Embassy. The implementer must have an active bank account in the name of the organisation to which we can electronically transfer reimbursements.</li>
  <li>Organisations must prove that they are able to manage the project sum in a satisfactory manner; the Embassy may request reports by auditors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exemptions</h3>
<p>We regret that we are unable to fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>academic courses;</li>
  <li>charitable activities;</li>
  <li>commercial activities; or</li>
  <li>infrastructure or construction projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Co-financing</h3>
<p>A partnership framework to support the broader engagement of a project is welcome and can strengthen your bid.  Please make sure to specify your other source(s) of funding in the concept note.</p>

<h3>Evaluation of project bids</h3>
<p>The aim of the project should be concise, feasible and sustainable. The expected outcomes should be measurable and the target group should be clearly defined and involved in project implementation. 
The assessment criteria will include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Financial and operational capacity;</li>
  <li>Relevance;</li>
  <li>Methodology;</li>
  <li>Sustainability;</li>
  <li>Value for money; and</li>
  <li>Impact.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting</h3>
<p>The Embassy will require monthly financial reports and quarterly project progress reports (narrative and financial) from implementers. The first payment will be made upon the receipt of a monthly financial report. When the project has been completed the implementer shall prepare and send a final report to the Embassy within the period specified in the contract.</p>

<h3>Implementation time frame</h3>
<p>Successful applicants will implement their project from May 2022 until 28 February 2023. All payment requests and reporting should be finalised by 15 March 2023. You are advised to plan project activities accordingly.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>Completed concept notes should be sent by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Kathleen.Moreno@fcdo.gov.uk">Kathleen.Moreno@fcdo.gov.uk</a> by 8 March 2022. If the Project Concept Note is successful in the first selection, the applicant will then be asked to submit a full proposal and an activity-based budget (ABB).</p>

<p>Successful applicants will be informed of the result in the week commencing 15 March 2022.</p>
