<h2>Discretionary discounts under section 13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992</h2>

<p>1. At present the full costs of discretionary discounts made under section 13A(1)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 are borne by the billing authority in accordance with the Collection Fund (Council Tax Reductions) (England) Directions 2013 (‘the 2013 Directions’).</p>

<p>2. When announcing ‘Homes for Ukraine’ on 14 March 2022 the Secretary of State indicated that the scheme would not affect the sponsor’s benefits or council tax status. In order to meet this commitment, the Government is legislating so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person who holds permission to enter or stay in the United Kingdom under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme is disregarded for council tax discounts. This will protect the host’s single person discount, and the 50% discount received by any household where all the occupants are already disregarded</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is no loss of an exemption where a household hosts a person who holds permission to enter or stay in the United Kingdom under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Sponsor households taking part in the scheme will receive a £350 monthly ‘thank you’ payment. This payment and the income of their Ukrainian guest has the potential to affect any local council tax support (LCTS) reduction the host is receiving from the billing authority, leading to an increase in their council tax bill.</p>

<p>4. The Local Government Finance Act 1992 (‘the 1992 Act’) does not permit in year changes to billing authorities’ LCTS schemes, and it is therefore not possible to legislate to prevent such impacts during 2022-23.</p>

<p>5. To protect the LCTS reduction of the sponsor household during 2022-23 the Government will encourage billing authorities to offset any Homes for Ukraine related changes in LCTS through discretionary discounts made under
section 13A(1)(c) of the 1992 Act. To facilitate this, the 2013 Directions are being revoked and replaced. The new Directions specify that where a discount is provided to offset an increase in council tax liability during 2022-23 resulting from a Homes for Ukraine thank you payment or a guest-related non dependant deduction, the billing authority need not make a payment into the collection fund.</p>

<p>6. The net impact of this measure will be that billing authorities and major preceptors will receive the same amount of income as if there had been no Homes for Ukraine-related impact on the LCTS claim during 2022-23.</p>

<p>7. The Government’s policy has not changed in relation to discretionary discounts provided for other purposes under section 13A(1)(c). The cost of these must continue to be borne by the billing authority.</p>

<p>8. The new directions are attached at annex A.</p>
