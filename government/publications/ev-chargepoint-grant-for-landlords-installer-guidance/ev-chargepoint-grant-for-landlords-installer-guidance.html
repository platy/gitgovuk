<h2>New digital service from 4 August 2022</h2>

<p>This interim guidance has been replaced by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance">new guidance and a new digital service</a>.</p>

<p>You should use the new guidance and service for <strong>new applications for residential properties</strong>.</p>

<p>You should continue to use this interim guidance and service for</p>

<ul>
  <li>any applications started before 4 August</li>
  <li>any applications for chargepoints on commercial properties</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>About the scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords gives financial support to landlords and other entities to buy and install electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) chargepoints at residential or commercial properties in the UK.</p>

<p>To access the grant, a landlord must first register.  Installers approved by the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) can then make claims for work completed on their behalf.</p>

<p>The grant provides funding towards the cost of buying and installing <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints. Chargepoints may be able to charge one or more vehicles simultaneously, depending on the number of sockets they have.</p>

<p>The grant amount given is per chargepoint socket installed. It provides up to 75% of the cost towards the purchase and installation of a chargepoint socket, limited to £350 per grant.</p>

<p>Landlords can receive up to 200 grants a year for residential properties, and a further 100 for commercial properties. These may be across a number of properties and installations or just for one property.</p>

<p>The grant is provided by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>The government reserves the right to terminate the grant at any time but will aim to provide 4 weeks’ notice.</p>

<p>Should the grant rate change, or the scheme end, the government will honour grant claims made before the date of any public announcement subject to meeting all relevant criteria set out in this guidance. The announcement will detail how claims made after it will be treated.</p>

<h2>Who can apply</h2>

<p>This grant is for entities that rent, lease or manage residential or commercial properties (referred to hereafter as landlords) and want to install <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints on their properties.</p>

<p>Your customer is considered a landlord and may apply for this grant if they are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>landlord of a property that lets the property</li>
  <li>right to manage (<abbr title="right to manage">RTM</abbr>) company</li>
  <li>companies owning the freehold of a leased or rented property</li>
  <li>companies owning a building’s common areas. The company may comprise shareholders who are the leaseholders. The company may also manage the building</li>
  <li>property factor listed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.propertyfactorregister.gov.scot/PropertyFactorRegister/" rel="external">property factor register</a>
</li>
  <li>private registered providers of social housing (<abbr title="private registered providers">PRP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>public authorities, such as government departments and their agencies, the armed forces, local governments, the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and emergency services</li>
  <li>charities</li>
</ul>

<p>Your customer must be registered at Companies House. If not, they must be <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registered with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>). If they are not registered at either, they will not be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>In considering eligibility,&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will use the public authorities referenced in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26/section/33" rel="external">Local Government Act 2003, Section 33</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/schedule/1" rel="external">Freedom of Information Act, Schedule 1, parts 1-3</a>.</p>

<p>At a later date, we will provide for PRPs, charities and property factors that do not have a Companies House or <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registration.</p>

<h2>Grant rules and restrictions</h2>

<p>Your customer can receive up to 200 grants each financial year. The financial year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.</p>

<p>Applications that span multiple financial years will be accounted for on the year they were first applied for. For example, an application in March that completes in April will be accounted for against the number of applicants in the March financial year.</p>

<p>Your customer can apply for one building or estate per application.</p>

<p>Where a parking space is shared between buildings and is not allocated, it should be treated as an estate and one application made for the estate.</p>

<p>Where a property is a multi-unit property, the address of the overall property should be provided.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Applications for residential and commercial properties must be separate.</p>
</div>

<p>Where a property is mixed use, separate applications should be made for any chargepoints installed for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residential use</li>
  <li>staff or fleet use</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple chargepoints may be installed and applied for as part of an application. This is true for either for single unit or multi-unit properties or estates.</p>

<p>The limit of how many grants a landlord can apply for in one application will depend on how many grants the landlord has already received of their overall limit for that type of property (residential or commercial).</p>

<p>Your customer may apply for subsequent installations at an address claimed for previously.</p>

<p>Each application should be treated as one job and have a single invoice.</p>

<p>One application should be handled by one installer. If your customer uses multiple installers, each will need to submit a separate application.</p>

<h2>Check a property is eligible for a grant</h2>

<p>Your customer’s property must be located in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Properties in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not included.</p>

<p>Your customer can apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>single-unit residential properties, such as flats and houses</li>
  <li>multi-unit residential properties, such as apartment blocks</li>
  <li>commercially let properties that have parking dedicated for staff use or fleet use of the tenant or prospective tenant</li>
</ul>

<p>If your customer is applying for a single unit residential property, it cannot be their place of residence.</p>

<p>If your customer is applying for a commercially let property, the chargepoint must be dedicated for the use by the staff or fleets of the property’s tenant. It cannot be for public use.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Holiday rental properties are not covered by this grant.</p>
</div>

<p>Where an installation requires cabling or other parts of the installation to be placed in or on another person’s property, or public land, access rights and permissions must be agreed by all parties using legally binding arrangements, such as legal covenants, before an installation begins.</p>

<p>If you are concerned your customer may exceed their grant allocation, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LandlordAccounts@dvla.gov.uk">LandlordAccounts@dvla.gov.uk</a> to confirm how many grants they have been awarded. Note that DVLA will only be able to confirm the number of grants already approved and not those that may be awaiting processing or submission by an installer.</p>

<h3>Private parking</h3>

<p>The space where you install your chargepoint(s) must be a private parking space. Your customer must own the parking space or have the sole legal right to it.</p>

<p>The private parking may be connected to the property or separate from it.</p>

<p>Your customer must be able to show you that they have legal entitlement to the parking space if it is separate from the property. They may prove this through the provision of Land Registry title deeds.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If your customer does not own the parking space or have the sole legal right to it, they cannot apply for the grant. This includes rented spaces.</p>
</div>

<p>The parking must be suitable for a chargepoint installation and be able to permit an eligible vehicle to be charged safely. It must be possible to access the parking space at all times.</p>

<p>Installers are expected to determine if the parking will permit an eligible vehicle to be charged safely.&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will not intervene in any negative assessment made by an installer.</p>

<p>Where multiple chargepoints are installed at a property, each socket installed should be able to charge at least one unique and clearly defined parking bay or space.</p>

<h3>Equipment requirements</h3>

<p>At the time of installation, all chargepoints must be on one of the following lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list">residential approved chargepoint model list</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commercial-approved-chargepoint-model-list">commercial approved chargepoint model list</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to ensure that the chargepoint model name is exactly the same as one stated on the eligible list. Claims will be rejected if the model claimed is not on the list.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If a model is not listed, it is not eligible for grant.</p>
</div>

<p>The chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If a chargepoint is not present, contact the chargepoint manufacturer to confirm why it is not listed.</p>

<h2>How the grant works</h2>

<p>You can get funding towards 75% of the total cost of buying and installing an <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approved chargepoint, up to a maximum of £350 per socket installed.</p>

<p>The number of sockets a chargepoint has is defined by how many vehicles it can simultaneously charge.</p>

<p>Details of how many sockets a chargepoint has may be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list">list of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approved chargepoint models</a>.</p>

<p>The grant involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your customer must register with DVLA using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords registration form</a>.</li>
  <li>You agree for work to be undertaken at a property owned or managed by your customer.</li>
  <li>Once the work has been completed, you, as an approved installer, apply for the grant on behalf of your customer. You will need tell <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> what was installed and send evidence to verify this. This will include a copy of your invoice and photos of the chargepoints installed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the grant is awarded, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will pay the grant to you, as an <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> authorised installer. You must pass the discount on to your customer.</p>

<h2>Customer registration</h2>

<p>Before your customer can apply for a grant, they must register with <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to get a landlord registration number. This will allow us to confirm they are eligible.</p>

<p>To register, your customer will need one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company registration number</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registration number</li>
</ul>

<p>They will also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a contact email address</li>
  <li>contact address corresponding to that registered with Companies House or their <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registration</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords registration form</a> and send it by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LandlordAccounts@dvla.gov.uk">LandlordAccounts@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Once your customer’s details are verified, DVLA will provide them with a landlord registration number for the scheme.</p>

<h2>Become an authorised installer</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">

<p>To apply for installer authorisation, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/residential-and-commercial-chargepoints-become-an-authorised-installer">Residential and commercial chargepoints: become an authorised installer</a> and complete the online form.</p>
</div>

<h2>Before you apply for a grant</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Familiarise yourself with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#rules">grant rules and restrictions</a>.</li>
  <li>Agree with your customer what they want installed, checking that the chargepoint they want installed is listed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residential-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approved chargepoint model list</a>.</li>
  <li>Identify if any upgrades are needed to the electrical supply and arrange with a distribution network operator (<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>) for this to be done before applying for the grant.</li>
  <li>Ask your customer how they will manage the chargepoints once they are installed, including maintenance and electricity costs.</li>
  <li>Ensure accessibility needs will be addressed when installing an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint, particularly for <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> owners who may be disabled or have mobility needs</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview of the grant application process</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;administers the <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords on behalf of&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. Installers should submit grant claims (form and supporting documents) to&nbsp;DVLA <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/olev-installation-grant/" rel="external">through the&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;installation grant portal</a>.</p>

<p>The following steps illustrate the processes relating to the scheme from the perspective of an installer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take an enquiry from a customer.</li>
  <li>Verify your customer has registered with DVLA and obtain their registration details.</li>
  <li>Verify that the property meets the&nbsp;schemes&nbsp;requirements.</li>
  <li>Conduct a site survey to ensure that the existing equipment and property is suitable for an installation. After any load management is applied, there must be sufficient electrical supply for all the installed chargepoints. If the supply is not sufficient or suitable, contact the local distribution network operator (<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>) or independent distribution network operator (<abbr title="independent distribution network operator">iDNO</abbr>) to upgrade the supply before starting work.</li>
  <li>Install the chargepoint(s), turn them on and check they work safely.</li>
  <li>For residential or commerical properties, complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords&nbsp;installation form</a>  with the customer. The customer will be required to verify that the information provided is correct and will need to sign it.</li>
  <li>Notify the relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr> and submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate.</li>
  <li>Invoice the customer (less any deposit paid). The customer should not be invoiced for the grant amount.</li>
  <li>Compile and submit a monthly grant claim form and supporting documents. Send the claim form to&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;by the last working day of the month following installation.</li>
  <li>Receive a grant from&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;or respond to claim feedback from&nbsp;DVLA.</li>
  <li>Retain copies of all customer details and required documents.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Documents required</h3>

<p>For each installation, the installer must provide a completed&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance">installation form</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance">claim form</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following documentation will also be required:</p>

<h4>1. Photographic evidence of the chargepoint installation</h4>

<p>Where one chargepoint is installed, you need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a close-up picture that clearly shows the installed chargepoint</li>
  <li>a picture showing the chargepoint in situ with at least the parking space and, if possible, the associated building</li>
</ul>

<p>Where multiple chargepoints are installed, you need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a close-up picture for each chargepoint</li>
  <li>one or more pictures showing all the chargepoints in situ. Each of these should clearly show the parking space(s) associated with each chargepoint. At least one should show, if possible, the associated building</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. A copy of the invoice supplied provided to your customer</h4>

<p>The invoice should clearly show the date it was raised, the customer details, the amount charged to the customer and the amount discounted.</p>

<p>If more than one invoice was raised, then all the invoices should be provided. The total cost must match that stated on the grant claim form.</p>

<h4>3. A copy of the&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;notification email or monthly spreadsheet listing installations</h4>

<p>The form can be downloaded by installers from the ENA website. There is a single notification form and a multi-notification spreadsheet that must be submitted <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/connecting-to-the-networks" rel="external">directly to the network operator</a>.</p>

<p>If this is not supplied, your claim will be rejected.</p>

<h4>4. A copy of the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</h4>

<p>If this is not supplied, your claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>The grant submissions must not be combined with claim forms for other chargepoint grants. If they are they will be rejected.</p>

<p>The installer must ensure that parts A and B of the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords installation form</a> are signed and dated by the customer, and part C is signed and dated by the installer. All parts of the&nbsp;form must be completed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;reserves the right to seek further information or documentary evidence from relevant parties in support of any individual claim.</p>

<p>Installers may attach their logos to these forms if they choose. Please note that&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;is unable to provide a proofing service to verify if you have completed the form correctly.</p>

<h3>Retention of documents</h3>

<p>Chargepoint installers must retain all documentary evidence for at least 3 years after an installation is completed. This information may be stored electronically or in hard copy and must be available to&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;immediately if requested as part of the grant claim assurance process.</p>

<p>A record must be kept of expenditure funded partly or wholly by grant claims and all income generated by the scheme.</p>

<p>All accounting records relating to that expenditure and income must be retained for a period of at least 6 years after each grant claim.</p>

<p>Accounting records include purchase orders, original invoices, receipts, accounts and deeds, whether in writing or electronic form. Such records must also be kept for any income generated with the help of grant.</p>

<p>The chargepoint installers must make these available at any reasonable time for inspection by officials from the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) or their representatives or by the Comptroller and Auditor General or his representatives.</p>

<h2>Installation requirements</h2>

<p>Chargepoint installations must be carried out in accordance with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="British standards">BS</abbr> EN 61851-1:2019</li>
  <li>the current edition of the IET Wiring Regulations – currently <abbr title="British standards">BS</abbr> 7671:2018+A1:2020</li>
  <li>the recommendations of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/installer-guidance-electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-guidance-for-manufacturers-and-installers#fn:2">IET Code of Practice for Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installations (as amended)</a>
</li>
  <li>the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>The final installation shall meet electrical safety provisions under relevant building regulations.</p>

<p>Equipment installed shall meet the applicable minimum ingress protection (<abbr title="ingress protection">IP</abbr>) ratings set out in <abbr title="British standards">BS</abbr> EN 61851-1:2019 and <abbr title="British standards">BS</abbr> 7671:2018 according to the usage location.</p>

<p>The electrical supply of the final installation should allow the charging equipment to operate at full rated capacity. Where local supply constraints prevent operation at full rated capacity, the charging equipment shall be classified according to actual output capacity.</p>

<p>Charging equipment must be supplied with an on-site 3-year warranty on parts and installation. Should the customer encounter any issues within the warranty period they should contact their chargepoint installer or manufacturer to request rectification of the problem.</p>

<h2>Accessibility needs</h2>

<p>When installing&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoints, it is important to consider who may use them, particularly&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;owners who may be disabled or have mobility issues.</p>

<p>All installation taking place under the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-installer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for flat owner-occupiers and people living in rented properties</a> should consider the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://shop.bsigroup.com/products/design-of-an-accessible-and-inclusive-built-environment-external-environment-code-of-practice" rel="external"><abbr title="British standards">BS</abbr> 8300-1:2018 (Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment – External environment. Code of practice)</a> and the requirements of disabled people or those with mobility issues.</p>

<h2>Help with wider responsibilities of property owners and managers</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a> requires property managers and owners to assess potential fire risks and put in place adequate and proportionate fire protection measures to mitigate against the risk to life from fire and then maintain them. This should be updated when installing&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoints.</p>

<p>The government will produce guidance to aid this assessment for electric vehicle fires, available in 2022. This will identify mitigations and measures that can be taken when installing electric vehicle chargepoints in enclosed car parks. As such it will help building owners meet their existing duties under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p>

<h2>Installer responsibilities</h2>

<p>Installers must not charge customers for the grant in advance of payment being made by&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>For each installed domestic chargepoint the installer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm ownership of the property</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoints are approved</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoints are tested to verify they are fully functioning and meets safety requirements</li>
  <li>ensure the same chargepoint is not claimed for twice</li>
  <li>ensure there is adequate electrical supply for all the chargepoints installed once any load balancing technology is applied</li>
  <li>retain all documentation pertaining to the installation, including installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates, photographs, customer declarations and signatures, dates of installation and full address</li>
  <li>record photographic evidence that demonstrates that the existing equipment and the installation meet the scheme’s requirements which should be retained by the installer</li>
  <li>ensure that all relevant fields on the installation form are completed</li>
  <li>notify the&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;of the installation in writing and submit evidence of this notification. It is the installer’s sole responsibility to inform the&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>. This will not be done by the&nbsp;DVLA</li>
  <li>submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interaction with customers</h3>

<p>The installer must make the customer aware of the conditions that need to be met for them to be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>The customer must sign a declaration in parts A and B of the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-landlords-installer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords installation form</a> confirming that they understand the conditions of the scheme and that the information supplied is correct.</p>

<p>A third party nominated by the customer may take responsibility for signing part B on the day of installation, confirming the unique chargepoint serial number, the amount charged and that the installation has been completed.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The installer must ensure they have 2 signatures and there are no gaps. If not, the claim will be rejected.</p>
</div>

<h3>Penalties for improper conduct</h3>

<p>Where there is reasonable evidence to suggest improper conduct on behalf of an installer,&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;reserve the right to withhold payment pending further investigation to ensure public funding is not being used incorrectly.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;reserves the right to withhold payment from the installer where the installer was aware of changes in circumstances that affect the customer’s eligibility under the&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords and failed to inform&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any authorised installers or authorised installer representative responsible for chargepoint installations that do not comply with the requirements of the scheme risk being removed from the scheme and their CPS operator being notified, particularly if there is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>failure to inform the relevant&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;of a chargepoint installation</li>
  <li>failure to submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</li>
  <li>an installation is found to be unsafe</li>
  <li>an installation does not meet the standards required for the scheme</li>
  <li>a site survey was not conducted, or an installation continued when the survey identified that the existing supply or distribution equipment was not safe</li>
  <li>inflation of costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>The costs of each installation must not be inflated or cross-subsidised across multiple installations. If evidence of cost inflation or cross-subsidisation is discovered, the installer’s authorisation will be revoked.</p>

<p>The installer should provide an invoice to the customer showing the total cost of the installation (including any&nbsp;<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>&nbsp;charged) and the&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;grant that is offset against that total.</p>

<p>For enquiries relating to&nbsp;<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries"><abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>: general enquiries</a>.</p>

<p>Eligible expenditure consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cost of unit</li>
  <li>electrical components</li>
  <li>civil engineering works</li>
  <li>labour costs (for installation)</li>
  <li>hardware costs</li>
  <li>the&nbsp;<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>&nbsp;incurred by the customer</li>
  <li>site survey works (when leading to a completed installation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an additional smart meter or current clamp device is required, the capital cost of this is also eligible expenditure providing it is installed at the same time as the chargepoint.</p>

<p>Examples of ineligible expenditure include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interest charges, bad debts, profits, entertaining</li>
  <li>project management and reporting costs</li>
  <li>administration costs</li>
  <li>inflation and contingency allowances (as an overall arbitrary percentage) additional to eligible costs – however, reasonable inflation rates can be included in labour and material cost estimates</li>
  <li>new/additional land required for the proposed infrastructure</li>
  <li>electricity provided by relevant infrastructure</li>
  <li>ongoing back office data provision</li>
  <li>any other ongoing operating costs (for example, maintenance or communication)</li>
  <li>any warranty extension beyond 3 years</li>
  <li>transport costs</li>
  <li>marketing costs</li>
  <li>any other cost not listed as an eligible expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h2>How and when to submit a claim</h2>

<p>The grant can only be claimed by&nbsp;<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>&nbsp;approved installers (on behalf of their customers) who are accredited by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.electricalcompetentperson.co.uk/" rel="external">competent person scheme</a> at the time of installation.</p>

<p>A claim may comprise an application for a grant for one or more installations.</p>

<p>Claim forms and required documentation should be sent directly to the&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/olev-installation-grant/" rel="external"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;installation grant portal</a>. If for any reason this cannot be used, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk">ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you have forgotten your&nbsp;<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>&nbsp;installer number, contact&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk">Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Installers may generate their own electronic versions of the&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords installation form. However, these forms must be in the same format and contain the same information as the&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for landlords installation form. Otherwise, they risk being rejected.</p>

<p>Chargepoint installers should submit their claim on a monthly basis.&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;is not able to process claims more frequently.</p>

<p>Within a single claim the installations applied for must be for a single month only. Any claims that include applications across more than one month will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Claims must be submitted before the last working day of the month following that in which the installations were carried out. Installers do not have to wait until the last working day of the month to submit a claim – they can be submitted as soon as the claim form is ready.</p>

<p>If installers cannot meet the deadline for submissions, they should make the&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;aware as soon as possible by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk">ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk</a>. The&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;helpdesk can be contacted for queries relating to your monthly claim using this email address or by calling 0300 123 1343.</p>

<h3>Worked examples</h3>

<p>a) If installations were to occur on 1 February and 13 February, an installer must submit a claim for both installations before 31 March.</p>

<p>b) If installations were to occur on 28 February and 1 March, an installer must submit a claim for the February installation by 31 March and a second, separate claim for the March installation by 30 April (as it occurred in a different calendar month).</p>

<p>If an installer enters administration, payment will be made by&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;to their administrator.</p>

<h3>Resubmissions</h3>

<p>You should resubmit applications as soon as you are confident that you have all the required information for a grant application to be approved.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;retains the right to disqualify any resubmission claims not submitted to&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;with the full correct evidence within one calendar year of installation. Such claims received after one year may be processed at our discretion.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to process claims older than one year at the grant rate prevailing at the time the full correct evidence is received if lower than the rate at the time of installation.</p>

<h3>Processing times</h3>

<h4>First time applicants</h4>

<p>First payment(s) may take up to 3 months to process following the first submission of a claim.</p>

<p>When an installer makes a successful claim for the first time, they need to be set up as a vendor on&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s finance system to facilitate payment.</p>

<p>The bank account information an installer provided at the time they were authorised will be used for this.</p>

<p>As an installer, you may be asked to verify this information.&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>&nbsp;will aim to do this as quickly as possible but any inaccuracy in the information provided or delay in responding will result in a delay to this process and payment.</p>

<h4>Subsequent applications</h4>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;aims to process claims within 30 working days.</p>

<p>DVLA&nbsp;will inform chargepoint installers if claims are successful or unsuccessful. If&nbsp;DVLA&nbsp;notifies you that a claim has been successful, payment may take up to a further 10 working days to complete.</p>

<p>This is only a guideline. Circumstances may mean that payments or processing takes longer. Where possible,&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will provide installers with information about any delays.</p>

<p>If, after 30 working days (6 weeks), an installer has not been notified, they may enquire about the progress of their claim by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk">ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The installer should provide the customer’s name, address and postcode,&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant number and the month the installation took place.</p>

<h3>Chargepoint audits</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, will conduct on-site audits of installed chargepoints to ensure the requirements of the grant are met. If a chargepoint is selected for audit&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, will contact the relevant party for further information.</p>

<p>Information requested may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates (including the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate and Building Regulations compliance certificate), including customer signatures, dates of installation and full address</li>
  <li>photographs taken at the time of installation demonstrating that the existing supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;requirements</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will seek to provide feedback on any installations audited.</p>

<h2>Enquiries</h2>

<p>Any queries relating to your&nbsp;installer&nbsp;number should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk">Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>
