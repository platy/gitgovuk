<h2>Who is likely to be affected</h2>

<p>Self-employed individuals and individual members of a partnership who have received a payment from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) but subsequently stop being entitled to that payment.</p>

<h2>General description of the measure</h2>

<p>Current legislation enables HMRC to reclaim overpaid <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants where the claimant did not meet the eligibility criteria at the time of claim. This measure makes changes to the time and circumstances when a 100% tax charge may arise in relation to <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> Scheme payments. It enables HMRC to recover grants where an individual was entitled to the grant at the time of claim but subsequently ceases to be entitled to all or part of the grant. It also extends the Treasury’s regulation making powers in relation to charges if a person is not entitled to a coronavirus support payment, to bring the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> Scheme within scope of the legislation.</p>

<h2>Policy objective</h2>

<p>In response to COVID-19, the government set up several schemes to support businesses and individuals, including the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>. This measure is consistent with the commitment to tackle fraud and abuse of COVID-19 schemes.</p>

<h2>Background to the measure</h2>

<p>The Chancellor announced the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> on 26 March 2020.</p>

<p>The Chancellor announced an extension to the scheme on 29 May 2020. This was followed by further announcements made by the Chancellor on 24 September 2020 to extend the scheme further, committing to the third and fourth grants. Spring Budget 2021 confirmed the fourth grant and announced a fifth and final grant.</p>

<h2>Detailed proposal</h2>

<h3>Operative date</h3>

<p>This measure will apply to <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> payments made on or after 6 April 2021.</p>

<h3>Current law</h3>

<p>Relevant provisions are at section 106 and Schedule 16 Finance Act 2020. Under paragraph 8 of Schedule 16, an individual is liable to a charge, if they are not entitled to COVID-19 support payments in accordance with the scheme under which the payment was made.</p>

<h3>Proposed revisions</h3>

<p>Provisions will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to amend s106(3) and paragraph 8 Schedule 16 Finance Act 2020.</p>

<p>Section 106(3) Finance Act 2020 will be extended so that the Tresuary may make regulations about the application of (including provison modifying) Schedule 16 to Self-Employment Income Support Scheme  Paragraph 8 of Schedule 16 will be amended so that where a recipient of a Self-Employment Income Support Scheme Scheme grant stops being entitled to keep all or part of the grant due to a change in circumstances, a tax charge equivalent to the amount of the grant to be recovered, can be applied.</p>

<h3>Impact on individuals, households and families</h3>

<h3>Equalities impacts</h3>

It is anticipated that those impacted will be represented, proportionately, in each of the groups sharing protected characteristics.</p>

<h3>Impact on business including civil society organisations</h3>

<p>This measure is expected to have no impact on eligible businesses who have received a payment from a COVID-19 support scheme to which they were, and remain entitled.</p>

<h3>Operational impact (£million) (HMRC or other)</h3>

<p>HMRC is not anticipating any operational impacts as a result of implementing this measure.</p>

<h3>Other impacts</h3>
