<p>National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949</p>

<p>Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</p>

<p>Declaration of National Nature Reserve</p>

<p>Districts of Somerset West and Taunton, South Somerset, Sedgemoor and Mendip</p>

<p>County of Somerset</p>

<p>Notice is hereby given that:</p>

<p>In pursuance of section 19(1) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and section 35(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and all other powers enabling them in that behalf Natural England has, by the Somerset Wetlands National Nature Reserve No.01 Declaration made on the 4th day of May 2022, declared that the Bridgwater Bay, Ham Wall, Huntspill River, Shapwick Heath, Somerset Levels and Westhay Moor National Nature Reserves are extended and collectively are to be known henceforth as the Somerset Wetlands National Nature Reserve.</p>

<p>In accordance with section 19(3) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (as amended), and all other powers enabling them in that behalf, Natural England has declared that the land having a total area of 78.15 hectares or thereabouts shown cross-hatched and shaded yellow on the map no.7 attached to the said Declaration, situated in the Districts of Mendip and Sedgemoor in the County of Somerset, (which land was included in the Ham Wall No.01 Declaration made by The Nature Conservancy Council for England on the 19th day of July 1995) has ceased to be held by Natural England and is now held and managed as a nature reserve by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.</p>

<p>The extension land having a total area of 2274.16 hectares or thereabouts shown single hatched or cross hatched and shaded yellow on the maps attached to the said Declaration, situated in the Districts of Somerset West and Taunton, South Somerset, Sedgemoor and Mendip in the County of Somerset, has been acquired and is held by Natural England or is held by the Environment Agency, Hawk and Owl Trust, National Trust, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Somerset Wildlife Trust, and Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, bodies approved by Natural England to hold and manage National Nature Reserves.</p>

<p>The said land now having a total area of 6138.92 hectares or thereabouts is being managed as a nature reserve, and Natural England is satisfied that the land is of national importance.</p>

<p>And in accordance with section 19(3) of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (as amended), and all other powers enabling them in that behalf, Natural England has declared that the land having a total area of 1.24 hectares or thereabouts shown cross-hatched and un-shaded on the map no.7 attached to the said Declaration, situated in the District of Mendip in the County of Somerset, (which land was included in the Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve No.05 Declaration made by English Nature on the 29th day of September 2006) has ceased to be held and managed by Natural England as a nature reserve.</p>

<p>The declaration and associated maps may be viewed on Natural England’s website at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-nature-reserves-formal-notice-of-new-or-extended-sites">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-nature-reserves-formal-notice-of-new-or-extended-sites</a></p>
