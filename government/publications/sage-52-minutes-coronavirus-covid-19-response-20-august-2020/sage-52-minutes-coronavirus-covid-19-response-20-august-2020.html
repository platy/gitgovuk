<p>Fifty-second <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> meeting on <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, 20 August 2020.</p>

<p>Held via Video Teleconference.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>1. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted the recent increase in infection rates in Birmingham, predominately amongst the South Asian population, but with a growing proportion of the Black British and White British population affected. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted that the pattern of spread is rather wide and does not suggest a single point outbreak. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> reiterated previous advice that acting early to mitigate further spread is critical.</p>

<p>2. Considering all available data, it is likely that incidence may be increasing slowly, meaning <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> may be above 1 in England and across the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>3. Risk of transmission at any large venue or event will depend on several factors, including prevalence of infection at the time; the design of the venue; indoor environment; and the nature of the event and the audience. Risk assessments and mitigation plans should therefore be specific to each venue and event.</p>

<p>4. Larger gatherings and events, particularly those held indoors, typically pose higher risks of transmission due to increased proximity and mixing of people. The gathering of people on the way to and from events in transport and pubs poses a more significant risk.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted risks in the timing of reopening large events and venues, particularly when incidence rates are increasing across Europe, and in some parts of North England, which could signal conflicting messages.</p>

<h2>Situation update</h2>

<p>6. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted the recent increase in infection rates in Birmingham, predominately amongst the South Asian population, but with a growing proportion of the Black British and White British population affected. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted that the pattern of spread is rather wide and does not suggest a single point outbreak. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> reiterated previous advice that acting early to mitigate further spread is critical.</p>

<p>7. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> thanked <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> for the hard work and support to date, on which it relies on for data and information. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> will continue to work closely with the new structure and organisation as it evolves.</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> approved <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> and growth rate estimates. The latest estimate of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> for the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> is 0.9 to 1.1, while the daily growth rate estimate is -3% to +1% (90% confidence interval). As previously, these estimates mask wide regional variation across the country and should be treated as a guide to the general trend.</p>

<p>9. In England, <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is estimated at 0.9 - 1.0, with a daily growth rate of -3% to 0%. However, these estimates of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> rely on lagged data (for example number of deaths). <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr> does not have confidence that <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is currently below 1 in England.</p>

<p>10. Analysis of pillar 2 testing data suggests a daily growth rate of around +3% over the past 2 weeks in England (90% confidence interval). As previously, this should be treated with caution given changes in the population being tested, particularly in areas of local intervention where testing volumes have increased. Additionally, interpretation of pillar 2 data is difficult as only 11% of tests have a known reason for the test being requested.</p>

<p>11. As previously, <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> does not have confidence that most regional <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> estimates are sufficiently robust to inform decisions, since they are based on low numbers and/or are dominated by clustered outbreaks.</p>

<p>12. Most recent <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> study data suggest a flat prevalence and incidence.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SPI-M to amend consensus statement to include context of latest ONS COVID-19 incident data by 21 August</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>13. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> discussed further analysis on testing strategies. Evidence suggests that testing could enable early release from self-isolation dependent on a negative test result, effectively reducing the 14-day self-isolation period. It was noted again that testing with earlier release would provide similar but not identical effects to 14 days self-isolation, and the overall effect will depend on adherence.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SAGE secretariat to ensure SPI-M advice on testing and release from self-isolation is being taken into account by DHSC by 21 August</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>14. As previously, <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted some complicating factors, including prevalence of infection; test turnaround times; and public adherence to testing and self-isolation, which may be influenced by financial implications of self-isolation (and duration of isolation).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SPI-B to review existing evidence on self-isolation compliance in relation to loss of earnings and potential incentives by 27 August</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>15. A significant and growing proportion of the epidemic in much of England remains in the British and Asian Pakistani heritage population, particularly young males (17% to 20%), and British and Asian Indian population (8% to 11%).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SAGE secretariat to ensure PHE data on COVID-19 incidence and ethnicity is considered by the Ethnicity subgroup by 21 August</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Opening large events and venues</h2>

<p>16. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> endorsed the <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr> and <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> papers — subject to amendments, and increased consistency between the papers.</p>

<p>17. Risk of transmission at any large gathering or event will depend on several behavioural and environmental factors, including the frequency of events and re-attendance of attendees; prevalence of infection at the time; design of the venue; indoors or outdoors; nature of the event; number and characteristics of attendees; distance travelled by attendees; and pre- or post-event activities.</p>

<p>18. Given the heterogeneity of events, risk assessments and mitigation plans should be specific to each venue and event, and co-produced with event organisers.</p>

<p>19. Consideration should also be given to risks associated with not holding or banning events.</p>

<p>20. Larger gatherings and events, particularly those held indoors, typically pose higher risks of transmission due to increased proximity and mixing of people. There may also be increased risk at different times of an event, for example during half time at a football match where greater numbers of people will congregate to access refreshments. In many situations, risks of crowding in indoor environments in transport and pubs associated with events may carry greater risks than the event itself and this should be taken into account in policy considerations.</p>

<p>21. Specific activities such as hugging and singing or cheering could also increase the risk of transmission, and may be enhanced by alcohol use. The difficulty in dealing with these issues in practice were highlighted.</p>

<p>22. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> reiterated the importance of improved ventilation at venues and highlighted issues of tracking and testing of attendees, before and after attending events.</p>

<p>23. Guidance and communication should be tailored to individual event organisers, and the public, to improve understanding of transmission risks and who is responsible for mitigating them, and to encourage adherence to measures.</p>

<p>24. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> agreed that pilots to reopen event venues should evaluate transmission risks and adherence to behaviours which reduce transmission, using observational and self-report data. There should also be careful design of indoor venue pilots.</p>

<p>25. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted risks in the timing of reopening large events and venues, particularly when incidence rates are increasing across Europe, and in some parts of North England, which could signal conflicting messages. This is a high-risk time to be restarting events, particularly indoor events.</p>

<p>26. Comms should consider how to communicate the issue of network re-connection rather than simply the risk to the individual.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SPI-M and SPI-B to amend papers on reopening large events and venues, ensure consistency of language and include context of previous advice by 21 August; SAGE secretariat to send finalised papers to DCMS, DHSC and C19 Taskforce; the table in the SPI-M paper, and the principles identified were seen as particularly useful</li>
  <li>SAGE secretariat to identify possible presentation/seminar to policy leads and customers on SAGE advice on mass gatherings by 27 August</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Opening Higher Education and Further Education settings in Autumn</h2>

<p>27. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> reviewed the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> and <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> Sub-group Output, which will be subject to further amendments. The paper was a note of the output and is not a <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> endorsed paper.</p>

<p>28. Considering ventilation in <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> and <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> settings will be important in controlling risks of transmission. Where possible, poorly ventilated spaces should be adapted to improve ventilation, or alternative options considered.</p>

<p>29. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> highlighted that <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> and <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> settings differ, with some <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> systems more similar to schools for example with many students living at home rather on campus like <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> settings. Variability between <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> settings is also greater than that for schools.</p>

<p>30. Consideration should be given to international travel, transport options and mixing of people in campus-based universities.</p>

<p>31. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> noted the risks of limiting face-to-face attendance at educational settings, particularly the long-term impacts of distance learning on socially deprived groups. This should be taken into account when considering policy options.</p>

<p>32. International comparators of outbreaks in universities and further education institutions should be considered in developing further advice for <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> and <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> settings.</p>

<p>33. Overarching principles should be designed to guide policy makers and universities and education settings to make individual, informed decisions. <abbr title="Higher education">HE</abbr> and <abbr title="Further education">FE</abbr> re-opening plans should also be co-designed with students, the workforce and the wider community to ensure it is achievable and will be adhered to.</p>

<p>34.Re-opening will carry with it pressure on <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> and will create new network connections.</p>
