<p>Internal drainage boards (<abbr title="Internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>) are public bodies that manage water levels in some areas where there is a special need for drainage. These areas are known as internal drainage districts (<abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr>).</p>

<p>The Environment Agency inherited the administration of 6 <abbr title="Internal drainage districts">IDDs</abbr> in Sussex from its predecessors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in East Sussex they were the River Ouse, the River Cuckmere and the Pevensey Levels <abbr title="Internal drainage districts">IDDs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>in West Sussex they were the River Arun, River Adur and the South West Sussex <abbr title="Internal drainage districts">IDDs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Since 2012, the Environment Agency has worked with those affected in each of the <abbr title="Internal drainage districts">IDDs</abbr>. They have agreed how to transfer its land drainage responsibilities within the <abbr title="Internal drainage districts">IDDs</abbr> to local stakeholders. These stakeholders would become responsible for managing the watercourses.</p>

<p>Formal proposals (in the form of draft schemes) were submitted to Defra in autumn 2015. Of these 5 of the 6 <abbr title="Internal drainage districts">IDDs</abbr> have now been abolished.</p>

<p>However, Defra received several objections to the proposed abolition of the River Arun <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr>. This is now the only <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr> for which the Environment Agency Board acts as <abbr title="Internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> .</p>

<p>A local public inquiry into the Environment Agency’s proposal to abolish the River Arun <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr> was held in February 2018, in Littlehampton, West Sussex. Its findings were submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment in May 2018.</p>

<p>Following the Inspector’s report and recommendations, the Secretary of State decided not to abolish the River Arun <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr> at that stage. They asked the Environment Agency to conduct further assessments and provide additional information.</p>

<h3>July 2020 update</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency completed these assessments but was unable to secure sufficient support locally for the land drainage responsibilities to be transferred. The Environment Agency has therefore withdrawn the River Arun internal drainage district abolition scheme. The Secretary of State has decided not to make the order abolishing the <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>The Environment Agency will continue to work with all interested parties to secure support for a new scheme for the abolition of the River Arun <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr>. This may be submitted at a future date.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Environment Agency will continue to act as the <abbr title="Internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>. This means that for the time being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Environment Agency will retain powers to carry out work in order to manage any flood risk from the ordinary watercourses (OWCs)</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency will continue the enforcement and consenting powers for the <abbr title="Internal drainage district">IDD</abbr> in relation to the OWCs</li>
</ul>
