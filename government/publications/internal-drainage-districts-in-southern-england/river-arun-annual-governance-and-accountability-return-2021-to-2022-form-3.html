<p>To be completed by local councils, internal drainage boards (<abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>) and other smaller authorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the higher of gross income or gross expenditure exceeded £25,000 but did not exceed £6.5 million</li>
  <li>where the higher of gross income or gross expenditure was £25,000 or less, but that:
    <ul>
      <li>are unable to certify themselves as exempt (fee payable)</li>
      <li>have requested a limited assurance review (fee payable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For a complete list of bodies that may be smaller authorities refer to schedule 2 to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/2/contents/enacted" rel="external">Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Guidance notes on completing form 3 of the annual governance and accountability return 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Every smaller authority in England that either received gross income or incurred gross expenditure exceeding £25,000 must complete form 3 of the annual governance and accountability return (<abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr>).  This must be done at the end of each financial year in accordance with proper practices (see page 11 on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nalc.gov.uk/library/publications/2897-the-practitioners-guide/file" rel="external">practitioners’ guide</a>).</p>

<p>The annual governance and accountability return is made up of 3 parts, pages 3 to 6:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the annual internal audit report must be completed by the authority’s internal auditor</li>
  <li>sections 1 and 2 must be completed and approved by the authority</li>
  <li>section 3 is completed by the external auditor and will be returned to the authority</li>
</ul>

<p>The authority must approve section 1, annual governance statement, before approving section 2, accounting statements.  Both must be approved and published on the authority website before 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>An authority with either gross income or gross expenditure exceeding £25,000 or with neither income nor expenditure exceeding £25,000, but which is unable to certify itself as exempt, or requesting a limited assurance review, must return to the external auditor by email or post (not both) no later than 30 June 2022 (reminder letters will incur a charge of £40 plus <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> sections 1 and 2</li>
  <li>a bank reconciliation as at 31 March 2022</li>
  <li>an explanation of any significant year on year variances in the accounting statements</li>
  <li>notification of the commencement date of the period for the exercise of public rights</li>
  <li>annual internal audit report 2021 to 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless requested, do not send any additional documents to your external auditor. Your external auditor will ask for any additional documents needed.</p>

<p>Once the external auditor has completed the limited assurance review and is able to give an opinion, the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> section 1, 2 and 3 – the external auditor report and certificate will be returned to the authority by email or post.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Publication requirements</h2>

<p>Under the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015 act, authorities must publish on the authority website/weboage.</p>

<p>Before 1 July 2022 authories must publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notice of the period for the exercise of public rights and a declaration that the accounting statements are as yet unaudited</li>
  <li>section 1 - annual governance statement 2021 to 2022, approved and signed, page 4</li>
  <li>section 2 - accounting statements 2021 to 2022, approved and signed, page 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Not later than 30 September 2022 authorities must publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notice of conclusion of audit</li>
  <li>section 3 - external auditor report and certificate</li>
  <li>sections 1 and 2 of <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> including any amendments as a result of the limited assurance review</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended as best practice, to avoid any potential confusion by local electors and interested parties, that you also publish the Annual Internal Audit Report, page 3.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Accountability Return 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The authority must comply with proper practices in completing sections 1 and 2 of this <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr>. Proper practices are found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nalc.gov.uk/library/publications/2897-the-practitioners-guide/file" rel="external">practitioners’ guide</a> which is updated from time to time.  It contains everything needed to prepare successfully for the financial year end and the subsequent work by the external auditor.</p>

<p>Make sure that the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> is complete (no highlighted boxes left empty) and is properly signed and dated.  If the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> contains unapproved or unexplained amendments, it may be returned, and additional costs will be incurred.</p>

<p>The authority should receive and note the annual internal audit report before approving the annual governance statement and the annual governance statement and the accounts.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="#eel-decline">completion checklist table</a> to review the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> for completeness before returning it to the external auditor by email or post (not both) no later than 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>The annual governance statement section 1 must be approved on the same day or before the accounting statements section 2 and evidenced by the agenda or minute references.</p>

<p>The responsible financial officer (<abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr>) must certify the accounts (section 2) before they are presented to the authority for approval. The authority must in this order; consider, approve and sign the accounts.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr> is required to commence the public rights period as soon as practical after the date of the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> approval.</p>

<p>Do not send the external auditor any information not specifically requested.  However you must inform your external auditor about any change of clerk, <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr> or chairman and provide relevant authority owned generic email addresses and telephone numbers.</p>

<p>Make sure that the copy of the bank reconciliation to be sent to your external auditor with the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> covers all the bank accounts.  If the authority holds any short term investments, note their value on the bank reconciliation.  The external auditor must be able to agree the bank reconciliation to box 8 on the accounting statements (section 2, page 5).  An explanation must be provided of any difference between box 7 and box 8.  More help on bank reconciliation is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nalc.gov.uk/library/publications/2897-the-practitioners-guide/file" rel="external">practitioners’ guide</a>.</p>

<p>Explain fully significant variances in the accounting statements on page 5.  Do not just send a copy of the detailed accounting records instead of this explanation.  The external auditor wants to know that you understand the reasons for all variances.  Include complete numerical and narrative analysis to support the full variance.</p>

<p>If the external auditor has to review unsolicited information, or receives an incomplete bank reconciliation, or variances are not fully explained, additional costs may be incurred.</p>

<p>Make sure that the accounting statements add up and that the balance carried forward from the previous year (box 7 of 2021) equals the balance brought forward in the current year (box 1 of 2022).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr> on behalf of the authority, must set the commencement date for the exercise of public rights of 30 consecutive working days.  This must include the first 10 working days of July.</p>

<p>The authority must publish on the authority website/webpage the information required by Regulation 15 (2), Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015 - including the period for the exercise of public rights and the name and address of the external auditor before 1 July 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Appendix A - Matters of internal control - an internal audit <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> report 2022</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Control objective F: Petty cash payments were properly supported by receipts, all petty cash expenditure was approved and <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> appropriately accounted for</h3>

<p>Not covered by internal audit as no petty cash balances are held or administered by the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Control objective G: Salaries to employees and allowances to members were paid in accordance with the authority’s approvals, and <abbr title="pay as you earn">PAYE</abbr> and <abbr title="national insurance">NI</abbr> requirements were properly applied</h3>

<p>Not covered by internal audit as there are no specific employees working for the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> as all work done for the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> is performed by employees of the Environment Agency who work on other duties. Therefore no salaries were directly paid by the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Control objective I: Periodic and year-end bank account reconciliations were properly carried out during the year</h3>

<p>Not covered by internal audit as the administered River Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> does not operate a separate bank account. It is therefore not possible to test a separate bank account reconciliation related specifically to the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> (i.e. cash book to bank statement to general ledger). Transactions that involve real ‘cash’ transfers are conducted through the Environment Agency’s bank account which is reconciled every month by its Shared Services Centre (SSCL) provider. The transactions that are recorded on the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> project codes represent the cash flows as if the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> were a separate entity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Control objective K: If the authority certified itself as exempt from a limited assurance review in 2020/21, it met the exemption criteria and correctly declared itself exempt.</h3>

<p>This control objective is not applicable as the River Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> did not certify itself as exempt.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Control objective M: The authority, during the previous year (2020/21) correctly provided for the period for the exercise of public rights as required by the Accounts and Audit Regulations (evidenced by the notice published on the website and/or authority approved minutes confirming the dates set).</h3>

<p>Finding: A statement is required to be published by the latest date of 30 June to allow public inspection to commence 1 day later, to cover the first 10 working days of July of each year. The Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> did not comply with this requirement for its 2020-21 <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> as it did not publish on its website a statement setting out the period for the exercise of public rights and commenced the public rights period from 29th July 2021 to 9th Sept 2021 which did not cover the first 10 working days of July.</p>

<p>Implication: Non-compliance with the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015 (Section 15) that requires to publish, on the Authority’s website, a notice for public rights inspection by the required statutory deadline.</p>

<p>Reason for non-compliance: A combination of two issues has contributed to the requirements not being met including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A change in key positions of Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> support staff during the year which impacted continuity of understanding around the timetable for publication (a new <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr>, clerk, and project manager were appointed).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accounts were originally scheduled to be presented to the July 2021 EA Board (acting as the Board of the <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>) but had to be brought forward to the end of June 2021 under Order 4.1 of the Standing Orders of the Board and which delegates authority to the chair (in conjunction with the chief executive and on the advice of other appropriate officers) to conduct urgent business between board meetings to ensure approval of the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> return by 30 June 2021. ‘Hard copy signatures’ on the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> return were not able to be obtained until one month after Environment Agency board approval which required postal distribution to signatories.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Management Action: A timetable has now been developed and is held on the Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> permanent management record to show the publication dates required. This will minimise the risk of non-compliance in future years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>Control objective N: The authority has complied with the publication requirements for the 2020 to 2021 Annual Governance and Accountability Return (<abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr>).</h3>

<p>Finding: Documents to show the conclusion of the Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> 2020 to 2021 audit were not uploaded to the Arun <abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr> “GOV.UK” website until 19 January 2022. This should have been done by 30 September 2021.</p>

<p>Implication: Non-compliance with the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015 (Section 13) that requires publication on the Authority’s website: the statement of accounts, the local auditor opinion and the annual governance statement by the latest date of 30 September following the end of the year to which the statement relates.</p>

<p>Reason for non-compliance: As above for control objective M.</p>

<p>Management action:  As above for control objective M.</p>
