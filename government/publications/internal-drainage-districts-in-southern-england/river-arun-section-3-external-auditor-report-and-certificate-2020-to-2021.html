<p>This is the external auditor report and certificate 2020 to 2021 in respect of River Arun internal drainage board.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Respective responsibilities of the body and the auditor</h2>

<p>This authority is responsible for ensuring that its financial management is adequate and effective and that it has a sound system of internal control. The authority prepares an annual governance and accountability return in accordance with proper practices which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>summarises the accounting records for the year ended 31 March 2021</li>
  <li>confirms and provides assurance on those matters that are relevant to our duties and responsibilities as external auditors</li>
</ul>

<p>Our responsibility is to review sections 1 and 2 of the annual governance and accountability return in accordance with guidance issued by the National Audit Office (<abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr>) on behalf of the comptroller and auditor general (note at bottom of page).  Our work does not constitute an audit carried out in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK &amp; Ireland) and does not provide the same level of assurance that such an audit would do.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>External auditor report 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>Except for the matters reported below, based on our review of sections 1 and 2 of the annual governance and accountability Return (<abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr>) in our opinion the information is in accordance with proper practices.  No other matters have come to our attention giving cause for concern that relevant legislation and regulatory requirements have not been met.  The smaller authority failed to publish the section 48 notice at the start of the year, the board should have answered ‘no’ to assertion 3 to disclose this non-compliance with the Land Drainage Act 1991.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Other matters not affecting our opinion which we draw to the attention of the authority</h3>

<p>We note that the smaller authority did not comply with Regulation 15 of the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015.  This is because it failed to make proper provision during the year 2021 to 2022 for the exercise of public rights, as the period for the exercise of public rights did not include the first 10 working days of July.  As a result, the smaller authority must answer ‘no’ to assertion 4 of the annual governance statement for 2021 to 2022 and ensure that it makes proper provision for the exercise of public rights during 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>In the completion of the annual internal audit report and the detailed report, the internal auditor has drawn attention to weaknesses in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relation to the provision for the exercise of public rights</li>
  <li>the publication of statutory documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>The smaller authority must ensure that action is taken to address these areas of weakness in a timely manner.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>External auditor certificate 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>We certify that we have completed our review of sections 1 and 2 of the annual governance and accountability return and discharged our responsibilities under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 for the year ended 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>External auditors name:  P K F Littlejohn LLP</p>

<p>Signed and dated:  29/09/2021 (a PDF document of section 3 with the signature is available)</p>
