<p>To be completed by local councils, internal drainage boards (<abbr title="internal drainage boards">IDB</abbr>) and other smaller authorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the higher of gross income or gross expenditure exceeded £25,000 but did not exceed £6.5 million</li>
  <li>where the higher of gross income or gross expenditure was £25,000 or less, but:
    <ul>
      <li>are unable to certify themselves as exempt (fee payable)</li>
      <li>have requested a limited assurance review (fee payable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For a complete list of bodies that may be smaller authorities refer to schedule 2 to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/2/contents/enacted" rel="external">Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014</a>.</p>

<h2>Guidance notes on completing part 3 of the annual governance and accountability return 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>Every smaller authority in England that either received gross income or incurred gross expenditure exceeding £25,000 must complete part 3 of the annual governance and accountability return (<abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr>).  This must be done at the end of each financial year in accordance with proper practices (see page 11 on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nalc.gov.uk/library/publications/2897-the-practitioners-guide/file" rel="external">practitioners’ guide</a>).</p>

<p>The annual governance and accountability return is made up of 3 parts, pages 3 to 6:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the annual internal audit report must be completed by the authority’s internal auditor</li>
  <li>sections 1 and 2 must be completed and approved by the authority</li>
  <li>section 3 is completed by the external auditor and will be returned to the authority</li>
</ul>

<p>The authority must approve section 1, annual governance statement, before approving section 2, accounting statements.  Both must be approved and published on the authority website before 1 July 2021.</p>

<p>An authority with either gross income or gross expenditure exceeding £25,000 or with neither income nor expenditure exceeding £25,000, but which is unable to certify itself as exempt, or requesting a limited assurance review, must return to the external auditor by email or post (not both) no later than 30 June 2021 - the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> sections 1 and 2, together with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bank reconciliation as at 31 March 2021</li>
  <li>an explanation of any significant year on year variances in the accounting statements</li>
  <li>notification of the commencement date of the period for the exercise of public rights</li>
  <li>annual internal audit report 2020 to 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Reminder letters will incur a charge of £40 plus VAT.</p>

<p>Unless requested, do not send any additional documents to your external auditor. Your external auditor will ask for any additional documents needed.</p>

<p>Once the external auditor has completed the limited assurance review and is able to give an opinion, the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> section 1, 2 and 3 – the external auditor report and certificate will be returned to the authority by email or post.</p>

<h2>Publication Requirements</h2>

<p>Under the Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015 act, authorities must publish on the authority website before 1 July 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notice of the period for the exercise of public rights and a declaration that the accounting statements are as yet unaudited</li>
  <li>section 1 - annual governance statement 2020 to 2021, approved and signed, page 4</li>
  <li>section 2 - accounting statements 2020 to 2021, approved and signed, page 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Not later than 30 September 2021 authorities must publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notice of conclusion of audit</li>
  <li>section 3 - external auditor report and certificate</li>
  <li>sections 1 and 2 of <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> including any amendments as a result of the limited assurance review</li>
</ul>

<p>It is best practice to also publish the annual internal audit report, page 3 – to avoid any potential confusion by local electors and interested parties.</p>

<h2>Accountability Return 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>The authority must comply with proper practices in completing sections 1 and 2 of this <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr>. Proper practices are found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nalc.gov.uk/library/publications/2897-the-practitioners-guide/file" rel="external">practitioners’ guide</a> which is updated from time to time.  It contains everything needed to prepare successfully for the financial year end and the subsequent work by the external auditor.</p>

<p>Make sure that the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> is complete (no highlighted boxes left empty) and is properly signed and dated.  If the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> contains unapproved or unexplained amendments, we may return it and additional costs will be incurred.</p>

<p>The authority should receive and note the annual internal audit report before approving the annual governance statement and the accounts.</p>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="#eel-decline">completion checklist table</a> to review the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> for completeness before returning it to the external auditor by email or post (not both) no later than 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>The annual governance statement section 1 must be approved on the same day or before the accounting statements section 2 and evidenced by the agenda or minute references.</p>

<p>The responsible financial officer (<abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr>) must certify the accounts (section 2) before they are presented to the authority for approval. The authority must in this order; consider, approve and sign the accounts.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr> is required to commence the public rights period as soon as practical after the date of the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> approval.</p>

<p>Do not send the external auditor any information not specifically requested.  You must inform your external auditor about any change of clerk, <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr> or chairman and provide relevant authority owned generic email addresses and telephone numbers.</p>

<p>Make sure that the copy of the bank reconciliation to be sent to your external auditor with the <abbr title="annual governance and accountability return">AGAR</abbr> covers all the bank accounts.  If the authority holds any short term investments, note their value on the bank reconciliation.  The external auditor must be able to agree the bank reconciliation to box 8 on the accounting statements (section 2, page 5).  An explanation must be provided of any difference between box 7 and box 8.  More help on bank reconciliation is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nalc.gov.uk/library/publications/2897-the-practitioners-guide/file" rel="external">practitioners’ guide</a>.</p>

<p>Explain fully significant variances in the accounting statements on page 5.  Do not just send a copy of the detailed accounting records instead of this explanation.  The external auditor wants to know that you understand the reasons for all variances.  Include complete numerical and narrative analysis to support the full variance.</p>

<p>If the external auditor has to review unsolicited information, or receives an incomplete bank reconciliation, or variances are not fully explained, additional costs may be incurred.</p>

<p>Make sure that the accounting statements add up and that the balance carried forward from the previous year (box 7 of 2020) equals the balance brought forward in the current year (box 1 of 2021).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="responsible financial officer">RFO</abbr> on behalf of the authority, must set the commencement date for the exercise of public rights of 30 consecutive working days.  This must include the first 10 working days of July.</p>

<p>The authority must publish on the authority website the information required by Regulation 15 (2), Accounts and Audit Regulations 2015.  This must include the period for the exercise of public rights and the name and address of the external auditor before 1 July 2021.</p>
