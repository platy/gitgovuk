<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance gives information for caseworkers on representatives of overseas businesses who have been posted to the UK to establish a branch or subsidiary of that business and representatives of overseas media organisations being posted to the UK on a long-term assignment.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed to be used alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business</a>  of the Immigration Rules. The rules explain the requirements an applicant must meet to be granted as a Representative of an Overseas Business, and this guidance provides additional information on how to consider their application. Paragraph references in this guidance refer to paragraphs in Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h3>Immigration Rules paragraphs</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business</a></p>

<h2>Validity for entry clearance and permission to stay</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to assess the validity of an application for entry clearance or permission to stay as a representative of an overseas business.</p>

<p>Before considering any application you must check the application is valid by referring to paragraphs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">ROB 1.1 to ROB 1.6 in Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">.</a> This includes checking the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the correct fees and any required Immigration Health Charge have been paid</li>
  <li>the applicant’s passport or travel document is genuine</li>
  <li>that both the application and biometric information are registered and verified</li>
  <li>the applicant was aged 18 or over on the date of application</li>
</ul>

<p>You must conduct verification checks if you have any doubts about whether the supporting documents an applicant has submitted are genuine.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied that the application meets all the validity requirements, you should consider whether to request further information, reject the application, or (on a discretionary basis) proceed with the consideration of the application.</p>

<h3>Government or international scholarship agency awards</h3>

<p>Where an applicant has received an award covering fees and living costs from a government or international scholarship agency in the 12 months before the date of application, the government or agency must provide written consent to the application. The letter of consent must be on the official letter-headed paper or stationery of the organisation or organisations, bearing the official stamp of that organisation and issued by an authorised official of that organisation. The documents must confirm that the organisation gives the applicant consent to remain in or reenter the UK.</p>

<h3>Switching</h3>

<p>An applicant can change (or switch) from another immigration category into the representative of an overseas business category if they are already in the UK, unless they have, or last had permission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a visitor</li>
  <li>as a short-term student</li>
  <li>as a parent of a child student</li>
  <li>as a seasonal worker</li>
  <li>as a domestic worker in a private household</li>
  <li>outside the immigration rules</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note switching is now a validity requirement, not an eligibility requirement.</p>

<h2>Suitability for entry clearance and permission to stay applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers where to find the suitability requirements that an applicant must meet when they apply for entry clearance or permission to stay as a Representative of an Overseas Business.</p>

<h3>Check part 9 grounds for refusal</h3>

<p>You must consider if there are any grounds for refusal of the person under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">part 9 of the Immigration Rules.</a></p>

<h3>Overstaying</h3>

<p>The caseworker must check the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except where permitted by the Immigration Rules in respect of periods of overstaying. Refer to the full guidance on overstaying.</p>

<h3>Immigration bail</h3>

<p>Any applicant who is in the UK on immigration bail is not suitable for the Representative of an Overseas Business route. These individuals do not hold permission to be in the UK.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for entry clearance and permission to stay applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers the requirements all applicants must meet to be granted either entry clearance or permission to stay as a Representative of an Overseas Business. Please note that Sole Representatives are only eligible to apply for extensions and settlement.</p>

<p>The requirements for granting entry clearance or permission to stay can be found in the eligibility requirements contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business.</a></p>

<p>There are 2 types of representatives of an overseas business: Sole Representatives and Media Representatives. Many of the eligibility requirements apply to both types, but there are some that only apply to one or the other.</p>

<p>The eligibility requirements can be found in the rules as set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entry requirement (ROB 3.1.)</li>
  <li>tuberculosis certificate (ROB 3.2.)</li>
  <li>work requirements (ROB 4.1. to ROB 4.3.)</li>
  <li>type of representative (ROB 4.4)</li>
  <li>genuineness requirement (ROB 5.1. to ROB 5.2.)</li>
  <li>English language requirement (ROB 6.1. to ROB 6.2.)</li>
  <li>financial requirement (ROB 7.1. to ROB 7.2.)</li>
  <li>additional business requirements for Sole Representatives (ROB 8.1. to ROB 8.6.)</li>
  <li>additional business requirements for Media Representatives (ROB 9.1. to ROB 9.3.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications which do not meet these requirements should be refused.</p>

<h3>Assessing eligibility</h3>

<p>When assessing an applicant’s eligibility, you must be satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, they meet all relevant eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>To assess this, you may request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>additional information and evidence, and refuse the application if the information or evidence demonstrating that they meet all of the criteria is not provided within a reasonable timeframe without providing a reasonable explanation for their failure to provide the requested information</li>
  <li>that an applicant attends an interview, and refuse the application if they fail to comply with any such request without providing a reasonable explanation for their inability to attend the interview</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have doubts as to whether the applicant does or does not meet the criteria, you must ensure that the applicant has been given a reasonable opportunity to address your concerns before refusing their application.</p>

<h3>Entry requirement</h3>

<p>All applicants must have entry clearance as a Representative of an Overseas Business before arrival in the UK.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis certificates</h3>

<p>An applicant must provide a valid tuberculosis (<abbr title="tuberculosis (TB)">TB</abbr>) certificate with their application, if they have been residing within a country listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t-tuberculosis-screening">Appendix T</a>  of the immigration rules, for the 6 months immediately preceding the application.</p>

<p>If a valid <abbr title="tuberculosis (TB)">TB</abbr> test certificate has not been supplied when they are required to do so, the application should be refused.</p>

<p>There is information on GOV.UK regarding which applicants are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">required to obtain a <abbr title="tuberculosis (TB)">TB</abbr> certificate</a>  before applying and the valid test centres.</p>

<h3>Work requirements</h3>

<p>All Representative of an Overseas Business applicants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>represent an overseas business or media organisation that that is active and trading outside the UK, with its headquarters and principal place of business remaining outside the UK</li>
  <li>be recruited and employed outside the UK by the business they intend to represent in the UK</li>
  <li>intend to work full-time for the organisation</li>
  <li>not intend to take any other work or engage in business of their own</li>
</ul>

<h3>Type of representative</h3>

<p>An applicant must be one of the following types of representative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a Sole Representative in the UK of an overseas business, who is a senior employee that was appointed to establish a UK trading presence by operating a registered branch or wholly-owned subsidiary of that overseas business (extensions and settlement only)</li>
  <li>a Media Representative who is employed by an overseas newspaper, news agency or broadcasting organisation and is posted on a long-term assignment for them in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on which type of representative the applicant is, they will need to meet additional eligibility criteria. See additional business requirements for Media</p>

<p>Representatives and additional business requirements for Sole Representatives.</p>

<h3>Genuineness</h3>

<p>You must be satisfied that the applicant is a genuine representative of an overseas business and must not have reasonable grounds to believe the business decision to establish a UK presence or the business decision to appoint the applicant as their representative has been done mainly so the applicant can apply for entry clearance or permission to stay.</p>

<p>To assess this, you may need to request additional information or undertake an interview.</p>

<p>If you suspect the applicant is not genuine or is complicit in taking the role as the overseas business’s representative primarily as a means to obtain permission in the UK, you must put your concerns to the applicant in clear language and give them the chance to respond (either in an interview or in writing) before making a decision. If you find the applicant to be complicit, you must include this in the refusal decision. For more details, you should consider the guidance on false representations.</p>

<h3>English language</h3>

<p>The applicant must have English language skills equivalent to level A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for English language.</p>

<p>Note that A1 level only includes speaking and listening and not reading or writing.</p>

<p>To assess whether the requirement is met, you should refer to the English language guidance.</p>

<h3>Financial requirement</h3>

<p>You must be satisfied that an applicant is able to adequately maintain and accommodate themselves and their dependants in the UK without access to public funds.</p>

<p>There is no specified amount of money that an applicant must have available, but any evidence of the applicant’s finance must be as set out in the Financial requirement guidance.</p>

<h2>Additional business requirements for Sole Representative applications</h2>

<p>This section tells you the additional business requirements a Sole Representative must meet to be eligible in the representative of an overseas business category.</p>

<p>They must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be the Sole Representative in the UK of an overseas business who was assigned to the UK to establish and supervise a registered branch or whollyowned subsidiary of that overseas business in the UK and that branch or subsidiary operates in the same type of business activity as the overseas business</li>
  <li>represent a business that has, and intends to retain, its headquarters and principal place of business outside the UK</li>
  <li>not be a majority owner of, or otherwise own or control, that overseas business</li>
  <li>be a senior employee of the overseas business</li>
  <li>have the skills, experience and knowledge of the business necessary to undertake the role</li>
  <li>have full authority to negotiate and take operational decisions on behalf of the overseas business for the purpose of representing it in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>Information on what is considered to be a Sole Representative and how to assess ownership and control can be found in What is a Sole Representative?</p>

<p>Information on assessing whether the UK establishment is operating the same type of business activity as the overseas business can be found in the UK establishment  section.</p>

<p>Information on assessing whether the overseas business intends to remain principally outside the UK can be found in the overseas business section.</p>

<p>Information on assessing whether the applicant is an employee with the relevant level of authority can be found in the Terms of employment section.</p>

<h3>Initial application as a Sole Representative</h3>

<p>Initial applications can no longer be made as a Sole Representative on the Representative of an Overseas Business route. If the applicant does not currently have, or did not last have, permission as a Sole Representative, their application must be refused.</p>

<h3>Extension application as a Sole Representative</h3>

<p>If the applicant has or last had permission as a Sole Representative and is applying to extend their stay, you must be satisfied that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have established and registered the branch or subsidiary of the overseas business they represent</li>
  <li>are engaged in full-time employment and must supervise the registered branch or wholly-owned subsidiary that they have established</li>
  <li>are required by their employer to continue in their role</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicant must provide the evidence and documents listed in paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">ROB 8.6(c) of Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business</a>. See Evidential requirements for more information. This evidence will help you to assess whether they meet the above requirements, but you can also request further information if needed.</p>

<h2>What is a Sole Representative?</h2>

<p>This section explains what you must take into account when you consider whether the applicant can be treated as a Sole Representative under the representative of an overseas business category.</p>

<p>You can expect the Sole Representative to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been recruited and employed outside the UK by the overseas business in a senior job role prior to their assignment to the UK</li>
  <li>a track record of setting up branches or subsidiaries for other businesses, if they have been employed specifically to undertake this role</li>
  <li>authority to negotiate and take operational decisions in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>A Sole Representative applicant must be a direct employee of the overseas business they represent or be employed by the UK branch or subsidiary they have established. The link between the UK branch or subsidiary and the overseas business must have been maintained and the applicant must still have sole executive responsibility for the direction of the branch or subsidiary.</p>

<h3>Sole Representatives who own or control a stake in the overseas business</h3>

<p>Where a Sole Representative owns or controls a stake in the overseas business, you must be satisfied that this does not amount to them owning or controlling a majority of that business. This principle applies whether that ownership or control is by shareholding, partnership agreement, sole proprietorship, or any other arrangement.</p>

<p>For the overseas business that they represent, Sole Representatives cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>own more than 50% of the shares</li>
  <li>control more than 50% of the voting rights</li>
  <li>be the self-employed owner of that business</li>
  <li>be the sole-proprietor of that business</li>
  <li>be in a partnership agreement in which they own more than 50% of that business</li>
</ul>

<p>Sole Representatives must also not be party to any other arrangement in relation to the overseas business whereby they are effectively the majority owner, controller, or the main beneficiary of that business, even though they may not actually own more than 50% of the business. For example, an applicant would be ineligible if a silent partner owns the majority of the overseas business but has agreed to give majority control and profits to the applicant.</p>

<p>As senior employees, it is common for Sole Representative applicants to have some amount of ownership or control of the overseas business. Where this is only a small stake in that business, there will be no reason to doubt the applicant’s eligibility with respect to ownership. If however the applicant has a substantial stake in the overseas business but it is not more than 50%, you may need to consider requesting additional information or undertaking an interview in accordance with the assessing eligibility section, especially if you have another reason to suspect they might be the overall owner (for example if the applicant founded the business or it is named after them).</p>

<p>In all cases, Sole Representatives must be employees of the overseas business as described in the Terms of employment. An applicant who owns a stake in a business may still be an employee (for example, many companies operate an employee share bonus scheme). However, in most cases persons who own or control a majority of the business they work for are not employees, and in such circumstances they would in any event not comply with the requirement to not have a controlling stake or interest in the business - as such, they should be considered for refusal on both grounds.</p>

<p>Additionally, spouses and partners of Sole Representatives who own or control a majority of the overseas business are not eligible to apply for entry as the dependant partner of a Sole Representative. Please see the Dependants section for more information.</p>

<h2>Overseas business</h2>

<p>This section tells you what information you must consider for an overseas business to meet the requirements of the representative of an overseas business category.</p>

<p>The overseas business must be a genuine active and trading commercial enterprise with its principal place of business outside the UK. You must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>its turnover: this must demonstrate the business is actively trading</li>
  <li>its registered offices: these must be outside the UK</li>
  <li>the type of business: this must be the same as the branch or wholly-owned subsidiary in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>its employees: this will indicate the size of the overseas business and may indicate whether it will maintain its primary place of business outside the UK</li>
  <li>its presence in other countries besides the one in which it has its headquarters - this may indicate a track record of international expansion whilst retaining a presence in the country of origin</li>
  <li>its finances, market share in its country of operation, and plan for expansion to the UK - these will help you to assess whether there is a genuine intention to establish and operate a UK branch or wholly-owned subsidiary</li>
</ul>

<p>The overseas business must intend to keep its main centre of business abroad. This does not mean that you should refuse an application if there is evidence that the business intends its UK branch or subsidiary to flourish so in the long-term it might overshadow the original business. You must however refuse the application when it is clear the intention is to move the main centre of business to the UK in the immediate future, or that the business will cease trading outside the UK in the shortterm.</p>

<p>You must also refuse if you are satisfied that the overseas business has been established solely for the purpose of facilitating the entry and stay of the applicant.</p>

<p>The overseas business must operate a branch or wholly-owned subsidiary in the UK in the same business as the overseas business.</p>

<h2>UK establishment</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to consider whether the UK establishment will meet the requirements of the representative of an overseas business category.</p>

<p>A Sole Representative applicant must have already established and be supervising an active branch or wholly-owned subsidiary that is owned by the overseas business they represent. The UK establishment can be either a branch or subsidiary.</p>

<p>A registered branch is part of a company organised to conduct business on behalf of the parent company. This enables someone in the UK to deal directly with the branch here instead of the overseas business in its home country.</p>

<p>A subsidiary is a separate corporate body that is wholly-owned by the overseas business but is otherwise treated as an independent company incorporated in the UK.</p>

<p>This UK establishment must be the same type of business as the parent business overseas, so it must supply the same or similar products and services. For example, an overseas manufacturing business can establish a UK branch or subsidiary for the sale or servicing of their products in the UK.</p>

<p>The UK establishment must be compliant with UK law and in most cases must register with Companies House within one month of opening. For further information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-as-an-overseas-company">guidance on registration as an overseas company.</a></p>

<h2>Terms of employment as a Sole Representative</h2>

<p>This section explains what terms and conditions of employment you must expect a Sole Representative to have to qualify as a representative of an overseas business.</p>

<p>A Sole Representative applicant must be a senior employee of the overseas business they represent and cannot engage in business of their own. This means that there must be a clear employer-employee relationship and a contract of employment between the overseas business and the applicant. The applicant must also have the authority to negotiate and take operational decisions on behalf of the overseas business.</p>

<p>To assess whether the applicant is an employee with the appropriate level of seniority and authority, you must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the applicant’s contract of employment</li>
  <li>the applicant’s job description</li>
  <li>the employer’s business plans</li>
  <li>other confirmation from the employer that, whilst in the UK, the applicant will have authority to take business decisions on behalf of the overseas business, to establish and operate a registered branch or wholly-owned subsidiary</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not satisfied that an applicant meets the criteria in this section, the application should be refused. If the applicant’s eligibility is unclear, you should request additional information in accordance with the Genuineness section.</p>

<h3>Employment status</h3>

<p>The Sole Representative must be an employee. They must be subject to an employment contract and the terms and conditions of their employment in the UK must comply with their employment rights under UK law. A Sole Representative cannot be a self-employed person who works for the overseas business, even if they are providing their services to that business under contract. If they are a director (or other office holder) of the business they represent, they must also be an employee with a genuine employment contract.</p>

<p>The applicant’s status as an employee will have been assessed when they were first granted permission as a Sole Representative. There is no requirement for them to submit a new employment contract with their extension application, and in most cases, you will not need to re-establish that the applicant is an employee. If however you have reason to doubt the applicant is now an employee, you should consider requesting further information.</p>

<p>It is possible for a founder of a business to also be an employee in some circumstances (for example, they may have founded a business and then subsequently sold their shares to an investor but continued to hold a role in the business). If the applicant was the founder of the overseas business, you should consider whether they are now an employee, seeking additional information if necessary. You should not refuse the applicant on the basis that they were not recruited by the overseas business except where this forms part of your evidence to explain why you are not satisfied they are an employee.</p>

<p>If the applicant is an employee, we would normally expect most of the following to be true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they’re required to work regularly except when on leave and have a minimum number of hours they are expected to work</li>
  <li>they have a salary and can expect to be paid for the work they undertake for the business</li>
  <li>they report to someone more senior than themselves in the overseas business and are subject to performance management and disciplinary procedures</li>
  <li>they get paid holidays, sick pay and maternity or paternity pay</li>
  <li>their employment contract sets out redundancy procedures</li>
  <li>their employment contract uses terms like ‘employer’ and ‘employee’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authority</h3>

<p>The Sole Representative must have the authority to take the majority of key operational business decisions locally. They can have responsibility for establishing and operating a restricted branch or wholly owned subsidiary of the overseas business. However, it is unreasonable to expect them to take unilateral decisions on all matters.</p>

<h3>Salary and hours</h3>

<p>The salary and other benefits must be appropriate for a senior employee in the business and relatively higher than other employees’ salaries.</p>

<p>Sole Representatives may be offered a remuneration package that consists of a basic salary and commission. This is acceptable as long as the salary element is enough to support the applicant and their family without access to public funds.</p>

<p>Sole Representatives must work full-time but this does not need to be linked to a set number of hours a week. The overseas business must be paying a full-time salary, for example, that is enough for the Sole Representative to support and accommodate themselves and any dependants without taking other work or access to public funds.</p>

<h2>Evidential requirement for representatives of an overseas business</h2>

<p>This section explains what evidence must be provided to prove both the employer and employee satisfy the requirements as a representative of an overseas business.</p>

<p>If you need to write to the applicant or employer for evidence, you can do so. Please note that the evidential flexibility rule does not apply to this category. Any request for further information would be on a discretionary basis.</p>

<h3>Documents required for extension applications</h3>

<p>If an applicant has, or last had, permission as a representative of an overseas business and is extending their stay as either a Sole Representative or a Media Representative, they must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a letter from the employer confirming that they wish to continue to employ the applicant in the same job</li>
  <li>evidence of salary paid by the employer in the 12 months immediately before the date of application and details of the renumeration package the employee receives</li>
</ul>

<p>If applying as a Sole Representative, the employee must also provide additional evidence about the branch or subsidiary they have established.</p>

<p>They must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence they have generated business, principally with businesses in the UK, on behalf of their employer since the last permission in this category - the evidence must be in the form of accounts, copies of invoices or letters from firms who they have done business with, including indications of the value of transactions</li>
  <li>a Companies House certificate of registration as a UK establishment (for a branch)</li>
  <li>a certificate of incorporation (for a wholly-owned subsidiary) with either a copy of the share register or a letter from the company’s accountants confirming that all shares are held by the overseas business</li>
  <li>a letter from the applicant’s employer confirming that the applicant supervises the UK branch or subsidiary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documents required for settlement applications</h3>

<p>If an applicant has, or last had, permission as a representative of an overseas business and is applying for settlement as either a Sole Representative or a Media Representative, they must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of salary paid by the employer in the 12 months immediately before the date of application and details of the renumeration package the employee receives</li>
  <li>a letter from their employer confirming that they still require the applicant to work for them, and that the applicant will be required for the foreseeable future</li>
</ul>

<p>If applying as a Sole Representative, the employee must also provide additional evidence about the branch or subsidiary they have established.</p>

<p>They must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of business that has been generated, principally with firms in the UK, on behalf of their employer since their last grant of permission, in the form of accounts, copies of invoices or letters from businesses with whom the applicant has done business, including the value of transactions</li>
  <li>either a copy of the share register or a letter from the overseas business’s accountant confirming that the UK business is wholly owned by the overseas business</li>
  <li>a letter from the applicant’s employer confirming that the applicant has supervised the UK branch or subsidiary since the last grant of permission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional business requirements for Media Representative applications</h2>

<p>This section tells you the additional eligibility requirements a Media Representative must meet to be granted entry clearance or permission to stay in the representative of an overseas business category.</p>

<p>Media Representative applicants must be based mainly in the UK and working on a UK long-term assignment. Applicants are usually journalists, but may be other employees, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>producers</li>
  <li>news cameramen</li>
  <li>front-of-camera personnel</li>
</ul>

<p>Their employer must have its headquarters and principal place of business outside the UK.</p>

<p>An overseas media business can have more than one representative in the UK at the same time.</p>

<p>Secretaries and other administrative support staff do not qualify and must apply under an alternative immigration route if one is available.</p>

<h3>Extension application as a Media Representative</h3>

<p>If the applicant has or last had permission as a Media Representative and is applying to extend their stay, you must be satisfied that they are engaged full-time in the job for which their last period of permission was granted, and that they are required by their employer to continue in that role.</p>

<p>The applicant must provide the evidence and documents listed in paragraph ROB 9.3.(b). See Evidential requirements for more information. This evidence will help you to assess whether they meet the above requirements, but you can also request further information if needed.</p>

<h2>Settlement requirements</h2>

<h2>Sole Representative: change of circumstances</h2>

<p>This section explains when you can allow substitutes and changes to the Sole Representative in the UK.</p>

<h3>Substitutes</h3>

<p>If a Sole Representative arrangement is terminated by either party, and the overseas business wishes to replace the worker with another existing employee, the following options may be possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the branch or subsidiary is established and can register as a points-based system (<abbr title="points-based system (PBS)">PBS</abbr>) sponsor, the replacement can apply under the Skilled Worker or Global Business Mobility Senior or Specialist Worker routes of the points-based system</li>
  <li>if the Sole Representative arrangement ends at an early stage, before the UK branch or subsidiary finds premises or starts trading, the business can register as a <abbr title="points-based system (PBS)">PBS</abbr> sponsor and apply for a replacement under the Global Business Mobility UK Expansion Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the Sole Representative route is now closed to initial applications, it is no longer possible for a business to appoint a replacement under the Representative of an Overseas Business route.</p>

<h3>Change of circumstances</h3>

<p>A Sole Representative given permission to complete 5 years in the UK in the category may remain even if the overseas company appoints a superior.</p>

<p>If the company appoints a superior to the applicant during their first 3 years of permission as a Sole Representative, you must refuse an extension application. In these circumstances, if the company wishes to keep the Sole Representative’s services, they will need to sponsor the applicant to switch into the Skilled Worker or Global Business Mobility routes of the points-based system.</p>

<h2>Grant or refuse settlement</h2>

<p>This page explains when to grant or refuse settlement (also called indefinite leave to remain) in the UK as a representative of an overseas business.</p>

<p>You must check there are no grounds for refusing the application under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">part 9 of the Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<p>If the applicant meets the requirements, you must grant under paragraph ROB 19.1. of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business</a>  of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>You may grant settlement if it is specifically applied for. If an applicant has been in the UK for 5 years and they apply for permission to stay, you must not treat the application as one for settlement.</p>

<h3>Refuse settlement</h3>

<p>You must refuse settlement under paragraph 19.1. of the rules if the applicant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not meet the requirements</li>
  <li>has changed, or wishes to change, their employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Refusal wording to use in refusal letters is available.</p>

<p>Applicants cannot appeal against our decision. However, if they think the Home Office has made an error in considering their application, they can apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-for-a-visa-administrative-review">administrative review</a>. Details of how to make an administrative review application must be included in the decision letter.</p>

<h2>Dependants</h2>

<p>This section tells you about dependants who accompany a representative of an overseas business. See the full guidance on dependants in work routes for details on assessing the requirements and refusal wordings.</p>

<p>A representative of an overseas business may bring, or be joined by, their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spouse, civil partner, unmarried or same-sex partner</li>
  <li>dependent children</li>
</ul>

<p>This is providing the dependants meet the Immigration Rules in paragraphs ROB 20.1. to ROB 38.2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-representative-of-an-overseas-business">Appendix Representative of an Overseas Business</a>.</p>

<p>If the spouse, civil partner, unmarried or same-sex partner of a Sole Representative has a majority stake in, or otherwise owns or controls the overseas business for which the Sole Representative represents, whether that ownership or control is by means of a shareholding, partnership agreement, sole proprietorship or any other arrangement, they are not eligible to apply for entry as the dependant partner of a Sole Representative and should be refused.</p>

<p>You must use the endorsement:</p>

<p>D:ACCOMPANYING/JOINING SPOUSE/CP/PARENTS’ Code 1.</p>

<p>You must grant entry clearance or permission to stay for the same period as that given to the main applicant, or for a shorter time up to, but not more than, the same period.</p>

<p>Dependants must register with the police if required by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-10-registering-with-the-police">part 10</a> of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<h2>Refusal wording: entry clearance or permission to stay</h2>

<p>This section gives wording to use if you intend to refuse an application for entry clearance or permission to stay as a representative of an overseas business. Some of these wordings also apply to extension applications and should be used alongside the additional refusal wordings: extension of permission to stay.</p>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list of reasons. You must use these paragraphs along with any other appropriate paragraphs, for example, if you are also refusing on grounds for refusal under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">part 9 of the Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<p>If an application for entry clearance or permission to stay is refused, the applicant cannot appeal against our decision. However, if they think the Home Office has made an error in considering their application, they can apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-for-a-visa-administrative-review">administrative review</a>.</p>

<p>Example wording:</p>

<p>‘You have applied for entry clearance to the UK as a Media Representative of an Overseas Business…’</p>
