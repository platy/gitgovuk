<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Grenada MEP Ministerial Statement</h3>

<p>Grenada has a marine space that is over seventy (70) times the size of its land space; therefore, the maritime economy represents a potentially significant contributor to the GDP of the country. The maritime economy also provides immense opportunities for economic growth for Grenada both within the historically important sectors (e.g., marine tourism, fisheries, mariculture, shipping) as well as for novel economic activities (e.g., offshore renewable energy, deep sea minerals, oil &amp; gas, marine biotechnology).</p>

<p>This MEP provides an opportunity for Grenada to formally explore the opportunities as well as the crosscutting issues that currently exist within this increasingly important subsector of the national economy.</p>

<p>Specifically, the plan provides an opportunity for Grenada to synthesize all the sector-specific plans and policies that are currently implemented within the maritime space into a single cohesive approach for the development of the marine economy that engenders the fundamental concepts of interconnectivity, sustainability, equity and good governance.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Sport, Culture and the Arts, Fisheries and Cooperatives would like to recognize the persons from within the public service, private sector and civil society that would have generously contributed their time to facilitate the production of this document geared towards expanding the economy of Grenada. The Ministry would also like to extend our gratitude to the UK Government for the support it is providing to Grenada via The Commonwealth Marine Economies (CME) Programme.</p>

<p>Hon. Yolande Bain-Horsford, Minister of Sports, Culture and the Arts, Fisheries and Cooperatives</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Ministerial Statement on behalf of the UK government</h3>

<p>The ocean is where life began and is essential for all life on Earth. It regulates climate and weather patterns, provides our food, medicine, energy and other valuable resources, facilitates marine transport and trade, and is full of wonders we have hardly begun to understand. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs also offer natural protection from the effects of climate change.</p>

<p>There is strong scientific evidence that effective ocean protection will be game-changing in turning things around for climate, for nature, and people. For many nations, especially Small Island Developing States (SIDS), or ‘Large Ocean States’ that is even more important, since the ocean is at the very heart of their sustainable economic development and the future of their people.</p>

<p>This Maritime Economy Plan presents a holistic view of the opportunities presented by the ocean for developing Grenada’s ‘blue economy’ sustainably. It addresses issues such as the role of marine tourism in the prosperity of Grenada; the need for responsible and sustainable coastal development to protect lives and homes in the event of extreme weather events; the potential of aquaculture and mariculture development for a more diverse and resilient economy; the need to consider the protection of valuable ecosystems in national planning decisions; and the provision of diverse training and job opportunities within the blue economy to ensure that future generations continue to reap the ocean’s benefits.</p>

<p>We are delighted that the UK has been working in partnership with the Government of Grenada to develop this bespoke national Maritime Economy Plan under the Commonwealth Marine Economies (CME) Programme. The CME Programme has also been supporting Grenada through the delivery of capacity building and scientific data collection, through the UK Hydrographic Office, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Science, and the National Oceanography Centre.</p>

<p>This research has provided much needed information about the health and status of the marine environment and how to manage it sustainably.</p>

<p>Through the CME Programme, Grenada has access to the newly created Caribbean Fisheries Climate Change Report Card, which defines the risks and threats associated with climate change to the fisheries sector and options for adaptation. Grenada has also benefitted from ocean modelling and monitoring which provides accurate risk maps for its entire coastal zone. This work has helped to support key climate change resilience and coastal zone management. For example, seabed habitat maps will ensure that in the redevelopment of St George’s Harbour, and the potential development of a new port at Grenville, the placement of new port infrastructure does not destroy biodiversity and essential fish habitats. This work on the ground builds a critical foundation for the 
 recommendations contained in this Maritime Economy Plan.</p>

<p>As Presidents of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the UK will make the case for ocean protection at every opportunity. We are pleased to be partnering with a number of Large Ocean States on the frontline of climate change to inspire climate action. There is simply no path to net zero emissions, or the sustainable development goals, or the recovery of nature, without effective ocean protection and sustainable management of the marine environment.</p>

<p>Ambitious and co-ordinated actions, like those outlined in this Maritime Economy Plan, are critical for the future health of our ocean. We welcome this Maritime Economy Plan, as well as Grenada’s work with the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States to develop a National Ocean Policy to strengthen capacity for ocean governance, as well as coastal and marine spatial planning to facilitate the transition to a blue economy. By working in partnership through the CME Programme, and through projects supported by our new British High Commission in St George’s, the UK and Grenada are supporting commitments made at CHOGM 2018. That includes the Commonwealth Blue Charter, which helps Commonwealth countries work together on a fair, inclusive and sustainable approach to ocean protection and economic development.</p>

<p>The UK Government remains committed to maintaining its track record as a reliable and committed development partner with Grenada in navigating this rapidly developing maritime sphere. We share one global ocean – so we need a whole earth effort to sustain it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>The Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme</h2>

<p>The Commonwealth Marine Economies (CME) Programme was launched in 2016 and aims to support 17 Caribbean and Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in conserving their marine environments and making the most of their maritime resources to catalyse sustainable economic development. It is designed to promote growth, innovation, jobs and investment whilst safeguarding healthy seas and ecosystems and it helps to address climate change, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Change Accord.</p>

<p>The CME Programme broadly comprises three components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Government Engagement and Dialogue: The UK Government is committed to working in partnership with SIDS Governments of individual countries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scientific Research and Capacity Building: To sustainably manage and use marine resources, it is vital to understand them. As a demand-led initiative, since 2016 the Programme has been collecting data, undertaking scientific research and delivering capacity building activities against a clear action plan developed from country requests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preparation of national Maritime Economy Plans: Where requested by SIDS Governments, and in partnership with them, the Programme will assess the existing national economies and identify the opportunities and obstacles to development. Bespoke national Maritime Economy Plans (MEPs) will be developed to enable individual countries to address economic growth and alleviate poverty</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) is leading this Programme, which since 2016 has showcased UK world-leading expertise in marine science through delivery partners at the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO), the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) and the National Oceanography Centre (NOC). The programme has also engaged a team of technical experts who are working in partnership with SIDS Governments to develop national Maritime Economy Plans. Examples of the work carried out in partnership with Grenada are provided in Section 1.5.</p>

<p>At the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in April 2018, 53 countries agreed the landmark Commonwealth Blue Charter, a bold commitment that sets out how member states will lead international efforts to sustainably develop and protect our ocean. The CME Programme supports the aims of the Commonwealth Blue Charter and is an integral part of the UK’s effort to protect the health of the world’s oceans and promote the growth of blue economies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Executive summary</h2>

<p>This Maritime Economy Plan is a partnership initiative between the Governments of the UK and Grenada. It provides an overview of the existing maritime economy of Grenada and sets out priorities and actions that aim to help the country demonstrate a clear vision and direction that takes account of national issues, international commitments and the challenges of a Small Island Developing State. Actions support economic growth, livelihoods and jobs and reduce losses from natural hazards, weather events and climate change. The overall objective is to help grow the national economy in a way that reflects the aims of the Commonwealth Charter, including good governance, sustainable development, gender equality and recognising the needs of small and vulnerable States.</p>

<p>The principles of low carbon, resource efficiency and social inclusion have been used to shape the development of this Plan. This is compatible with the concept of the ‘blue economy’, which first emerged at the 2012 Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and recognises the need to maximise the vast economic potential of the ocean while also preserving it for current and future generations. Progress towards a blue economy can help achieve a range of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and others.</p>

<p>The maritime economy includes established sectors such as fisheries, tourism and shipping as well as emerging activities such as offshore renewable energy, aquaculture and marine biotechnology. It also includes the policies and management of these sectors and of the coastal and marine environment on which these sectors rely. This Plan describes the maritime economy in terms of Bedrock / Traditional sectors and Emerging sectors, although other reports may describe it using different categories (there is no internationally agreed way to describe maritime economy sectors).</p>

<p>This Maritime Economy Plan has been produced as a result of several months of desk work, structured questionnaires, a consultative mission to Grenada and discussions with a range of Government, NGO, and other stakeholders. It is therefore very much a strategic overview of Grenada’s maritime economic potential. Each maritime economy sector was subject to a bespoke multicriteria analysis using the information collected from all the sources to consider governance, environment, social factors, technology, economy and resilience and risk.</p>

<p>The Maritime Economy Plan was subject to review, feedback and update during 2020 / 2021, in consultation with the Government of Grenada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions, engagement with stakeholders was carried out remotely through a series of online meetings, phone calls and emails.</p>

<p>Key findings for Grenada’s maritime economy are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the development of marine tourism is growing and playing an increasing role in the country’s prosperity, but the sector needs to be managed in a way that ensures long term sustainability, particularly from coastal development, yachting and cruise tourism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the National Ocean Policy (NOP) offers a framework to develop new maritime activities and ensure they are carried out in a sustainable manner. The NOP can act as a planning policy guidance document to help implement actions and recommendations in this Maritime Economy Plan and other policies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is currently no National Maritime Transport Policy. Such a policy could help meet International Maritime Organisation (IMO) requirements around safety at sea, pollution response and flag, coastal and port state measures. This will help to address some of the water quality / port waste issues in Grenada</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>efforts to improve public awareness of marine and coastal safety (including boating, swimming etc.) are important to address a perceived cultural fear of the sea, which is limiting the realisation of the opportunities of a blue economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the economy of Grenada and the Caribbean as a whole. GDP for 2020 is expected to reduce by 12% compared to 2019. The number of tourism visitors was reduced by 59% in 2020 compared to 2019, with ripple effects felt across the country. Some businesses have found alternative income generating solutions, including online activities. The World Bank has approved a US$25 million COVID-19 Crisis Response and Fiscal Management Development Policy Credit to support the country’s efforts to respond to the COVID-19 crisis</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Actions, primary actors (who should be responsible for the actions) and desired outcomes are presented for each maritime economy sector. These are high level actions that are of strategic importance for the sector and the country. Each sector is given a prioritisation category – Urgent, New / Needs Attention or Well Established.</p>

<p>19 actions are identified. The Coastal Development sector requires urgent attention. Coastal infrastructure linked to tourism is an important area of development. Management of climate change impacts to tourism facilities through climate resilient tourism policies, plans and management of the coastal zone is key. The development of Shoreline Management plans to prioritise coastal erosion and risk management plans will aid Grenada’s ability to adapt to climate change. In addition, integrated island development plans that take account of all development needs that link to climate risk and resilience are required.</p>

<p>Shipping and ports is a well-established sector. In order to strengthen the sector, assessments into marine pollution contingency planning and the capacity of ports, harbours and landing sites to manage waste are required in addition to developing a strategy to enhance training of marine professionals and seafarers.</p>

<p>The fisheries sector would benefit from mainstreaming the sustainable use of marine resources in national policies and planning frameworks to ensure cross-Government understanding of the importance of fisheries to livelihoods and the economy. In addition, formalising the maritime boundaries, mapping and enforcing the boundaries would assist in protecting fishers’ rights and jurisdiction in marine areas.</p>

<p>Investment in research and development of marine renewable energy technologies would strengthen the established energy sector by reducing reliability on fossil fuels in Grenada.</p>

<p>Aquaculture and mariculture and ecosystem services are emerging sectors which need attention in order to contribute sustainably to Grenada’s maritime economy. Undertaking feasibility assessments to consider the future direction for the aquaculture and mariculture sector and updating the National Fisheries Policy would benefit the sector. An ecosystem valuation assessment will help to ensure that ecosystem services are protected and considered for future decision making.</p>

<p>The creation and implementation of a National Ocean Policy (NOP) coordinated and advised by a formally established National Ocean Governance Committee (NOGC) is an overarching action needed to improve linkages between current policies and plans of relevance to Grenada’s marine space. Such a cross-government, integrated approach is needed to embed the concept of the blue economy across Ministries and Departments to effectively manage, protect and enhance the marine area and the economic opportunities it provides for improving livelihoods and equality.</p>

<p>The actions, issues and outcomes identified in this Maritime Economy Plan are high level, strategic issues that require further discussion and development before they can be implemented. Appropriate sources of funding need to be identified to support this process. The Maritime Economy Plan has been able to identify organisations potentially able to provide suitable funding, however, it was beyond the scope of this initial high level approach to develop the actions and identify specific funds at this stage.</p>

<p>The next step along the pathway towards a blue economy is for Grenada to work across government to identify those actions that are highest priority and which the country is most able to develop and implement in order to create detailed implementation plans and funding applications capable of achieving success with regional and national development agencies and funds. Such packages should create synergies with Grenada’s NOP, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Policy and Blue Growth Strategic Masterplan, link to regional activities and goals in the Caribbean (e.g. Eastern Caribbean Regional Ocean Policy, SAMOA Pathway) and meet the aims and objectives of donor countries and organisations; and funding programme priorities. This is a significant task and should be addressed in a partnership approach across government and with regional organisations. The UK Government supports the aims of the Commonwealth Blue Charter through the Commonwealth Marine Economies (CME) Programme. The CME Programme is supporting Caribbean and Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to preserve their marine environments and make the most of their maritime resources to catalyse sustainable economic development, whilst safeguarding the health of the ocean.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>1. Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>1.1. What is the Maritime Economy?</h3>

<p>A maritime economy can include diverse components, from established ocean industries such as fisheries, tourism and maritime transport, to emerging activities such as offshore renewable energy, aquaculture, deep sea mining, and marine biotechnology. The mix will depend on national circumstances but will provide social and economic benefits for current and future generations, restoring and protecting the diversity, productivity, resilience and natural capital of marine ecosystems.</p>

<p>In the context of developing Maritime Economy Plans, the terms marine or maritime economy and blue economy are considered synonymous, such that the focus on the maritime economy, and plans to support its development and growth, encompass the sustainability and equity concepts of the blue economy.</p>

<p>Blue economy has been defined as, “economic activities that (i) take place in the marine environment or that (ii) use sea resources as an input, as well as economic activities that (iii)	are involved in the production of goods or the provision of services that will directly contribute to activities that take place in the marine environment”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>At its simplest, the blue economy includes all economic activities (existing and potential) that depend on the existence of the ocean, either directly or indirectly. For Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the blue economy often comprises the majority of the national economy, with so many economic activities dependent on the ocean. Interactions between economic, ecological and social interests on land and at sea, therefore, become symbiotic and difficult to disentangle, such that a development on one side of the land/sea interface affects the other.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>1.1.1. Sectors in the Maritime Economy</h3>

<p>The maritime economy can be divided and subdivided in many ways, with high-level generic divisions such as ‘Harvesting of resources’, ‘Trade and commerce’, and ‘Ecosystem services’ giving way to more detailed categories based on specific and established ocean industries such as ‘fishing’, ‘shipping’ or ‘tourism’. These can be subdivided further – ‘fishing’ can be divided by vessel size, catch method or target species and can include onshore activities such as selling and processing or supporting activities such as netmaking and repair or chandlery and vessel maintenance.</p>

<p>A key step in the development of sustainable Maritime Economy Plans is to analyse existing maritime sectors, known as ‘bedrock’ or traditional sectors, to help their transition to more sustainable practices, where needed. Consideration is given to the potential for developing new sustainable maritime activities to replace those that are in decline or diversify the economy. Natural capital / ecosystem services are also taken into account as these underpin so many economic sectors and activities.</p>

<p>Natural resources and the economic benefit derived from them, whether specifically measured and included in economic valuations or not, are often termed ‘ecosystem services’ and are also considered as part of the blue economy.</p>

<p>These traditionally non-monetised resources, such as the coastal defence benefit derived from reefs, are increasingly being explicitly considered in management decisions and are integral to the value and support of the blue economy as they underpin and support many of the traditional sectors such as fishing and tourism.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>1.2. What is a Maritime Economy Plan?</h3>

<p>There are many types of plan used and applied in the management of the marine area. Most countries have some form of planning in their marine area already, even if they are not specifically called a ‘Marine Plan’ e.g. designation of shipping / navigation lanes or the identification of protected areas for conservation or fishing. Planning helps to communicate and achieve objectives. Planning, as a process, is important for a range of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>increases efficiency by avoiding activities that do not work towards the stated objectives of the plan and by helping to organise resources</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>facilitates coordination between organisations – everyone knows what the objectives are and helps to define roles and responsibilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>helps to maintain management control over activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>helps facilitate consistent decision making</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>1.3.  How to use this Plan</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>this Plan only considers sustainable (blue) practices and is concerned with finance and economics of the Grenada Marine Area. It focuses on opportunities and risks to sustainable economic development and areas where there are greater opportunities / risks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it may be used to support decisions about strategic Government / financial support bodies or mechanisms for sectors to develop e.g. should there be financial support for a new fishery, for fleet renewal, for renewable energy supply chain development. Ideally, a Maritime (or Blue) Economy Plan should sit underneath and assist the implementation of a National Ocean Policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is not the intention that this Plan will be used to inform individual management decisions by regulators about which individual activities should / shouldn’t be permitted in a particular place / time - this is the role of a Marine Spatial Plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it does not set priorities for all activities / uses - there are activities that take place in the marine area which don’t have a ‘traditional’ economic benefit that are not included (e.g. cultural use, landscape/ seascape, non-use values, recreation, health benefits). Such activities and uses will however be enshrined within a National Ocean Policy (which may sit above this plan) or be presented within a Marine Spatial Plan, which might sit alongside this document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it does not contain management measures, but may identify how management can be financed e.g. user access fees for recreational diving areas, blue bonds, etc</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>1.4. Benefits of a Maritime Economy Plan for Grenada</h3>

<p>Maritime Economy Plans (MEPs) enable an analysis of existing maritime sectors to be undertaken in order to help the transition to more sustainable practices, where needed, and to consider the potential for developing new, sustainable marine activities. The work identifies the bedrock / traditional sectors of the maritime economy, the emerging sectors and the natural capital / ecosystem services utilised.</p>

<p>Having a Maritime Economy Plan helps to demonstrate that there is a clear vision and direction for the development of a sustainable maritime economy that takes account of national issues, international commitments, such as working towards the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular reference to SDG14 – Life Below Water, and the challenges associated with a number of themes shared by Grenada and other SIDS, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high dependency on imports for energy – the main source of energy is from hydrocarbons that have to be imported</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high dependency on imports for food supply</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reliance on one or a few economic sectors (e.g. fishing, tourism, etc)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large ocean resource, with potential for new / emerging sector growth (e.g. biotechnology, renewable energy, minerals, etc).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>capacity constraints to effectively manage / exploit sustainably a large ocean area / resource - relatively small population, government, resource (e.g. navy, research / exploration capability)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks (e.g. earthquakes, tsunami, hurricanes), including those driven by climate change (e.g. sea level rise, ocean acidification) with low resilience / ability to recover</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional co-operation and organisations are well established (these may be sector specific e.g. fisheries, or more wide ranging)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>remote locations – increases costs for both imports and exports of goods and services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high levels of poverty / social inequality – need to make growth inclusive to benefit all</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high country debt and high relative proportion of government budget on servicing debt</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The overall objective is to grow the national economy, such that the country becomes economically resilient and less reliant on financial aid. It is also intended to reflect the aims of the Commonwealth Charter, including good governance, sustainable development, gender equality and recognising the needs of small and vulnerable States.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>1.5.  The Commonwealth Marine Economies Programme in Grenada</h3>

<p>A number of priority activities have been carried out in Grenada under the CME Programme, following an initial round of national engagement on country priorities in 2016. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>supply of new navigation charts and training in the use of new maps and bathymetric data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>production of a Maritime Safety Information development plan to assist port authorities with compliance of international shipping regulations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provision of data on coastal sensitivity to oil spills and risk of introduction of non-native species for the national and regional disaster management teams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>coastal assets and community vulnerability risk assessment against climate change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>training on measuring sea level, surface winds and waves to help predict natural hazards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the development of habitat maps that will be key to ensuring that the placement of new port infrastructure will not destroy biodiversity and essential fish habitat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blue Carbon report on seagrasses and mangroves that supports Natural Capital Accounting, previous economic assessments of blue carbon and the Grenada National Ecosystem Assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national coastal risk assessment work that required bathymetric surveys and national and regional ocean modelling. This produced a risk map of the entire coastal zone of Grenada to facilitate planning for preventative or mitigative measures to minimise risk to coastal infrastructure and local communities in the face of such natural hazards. This work has allowed assessments to be made for the redevelopment of St George’s Harbour and a potential new port at Grenville on the east coast</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regional Caribbean initiatives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>ocean modelling and monitoring using the Caribbean regional Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model to validate water level, currents, temperature and salinity data to support climate change resilience and decision-making</p>
      </li>
      <li>development of the Caribbean Regional Climate Change Report Card to clearly define the risks and threats associated with climate change in vulnerable areas. This report card was used as a formal submission by the region into the UNFCCC process</li>
      <li>Hydrographic governance training and action planning to help identify and prioritise hydrographic data gaps and capacity requirements, based on economic risks, opportunities, safety at sea (e.g. ship-wrecks), environment and crisis management</li>
      <li>development of a risk register, list of case studies and guidance to improve the planning, design, and installation of subsea cables to reduce risk from hazards. This will improve understanding of the impact of hazardous events to communications cables and their causes; and therefore, improve telecommunications resilience</li>
      <li>production of a fisheries Report Card for the Caribbean on increasing the resilience of the sector to climate change</li>
      <li>development of a report and workshop to raise awareness of renewable energy opportunities in the Caribbean</li>
      <li>development of a spiny lobster larval dispersal model for the Caribbean to inform the assessment of the potential for spiny lobster aquaculture in the region (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines)</li>

<span class="number">5. </span>Grenada’s Maritime Economy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>2.1. Background</h3>

<p>Grenada is a tri-island nation comprising the islands of Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique, and is one of the most southerly of the Windward Islands in the Eastern Caribbean. The needs, challenges and development opportunities of the smaller islands are intimately connected with the ocean and distinct from those of the island of Grenada.</p>

<h4>Figure 3 – Map of Grenada</h4>

<p>Source: https://www.worldometers.info/maps/grenada-map/</p>

<p>Hurricanes Ivan and Emily in 2004 and 2005 significantly impacted Grenada’s economy, such that some sectors are not fully recovered even now. The total damage from Hurricane Ivan alone was estimated at twice Grenada’s GDP (Govt. of Grenada, 2017)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Between 2000 and 2005 real GDP growth averaged about 5.5% per year but then decreased annually to 2012, as a result of weather events, global economic crises and a reduction in US tourist visitors. GDP has since returned to growth<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Grenada has a largely tourism-based, small, open economy that has shifted from one that was agriculture-dominant into one that is services-dominant, with tourism serving as the leading foreign currency earning sector.</p>

<p>Agriculture and fishing remain important sectors, dominating exports - nutmeg and mace, cocoa; fresh fruit and vegetables and fresh fish account for around 50% of Grenada’s exports (OEC website)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Grenada’s economic growth is predicted to continue, while both unemployment and public debt are predicted to continue to fall. The Citizenship-By-Investment (CBI) programme is both financing the external deficit and supporting economic growth (IMF website)7. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) projects economic growth of 4.5%, with similar outcomes expected over the medium term (CDB, 2018).</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the economy of Grenada and the Caribbean as a whole. Grenada’s GDP grew an estimated 3.1% in 2019 driven by strong activity in the construction and tourism sectors. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic this is expected to reduce by 12% for 2020. It is forecast to rise to 6.1% in 2021 subject to the post-pandemic global economic recovery.</p>

<p>The number of tourism visitors was reduced by 59% in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting in a reduction in the hotel and tourism sector and leading to a significant fall in employment in the sector. Ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been felt across the country with closure of educational institutions, cessation of non-essential economic and social activities, alongside dwindling construction and investment activity.</p>

<p>Businesses have diversified their activities and have found alternative income generating solutions. A number of new industries have been developed, particularly online businesses. Grenada Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) and Grenada Chamber of Industry and Commerce (GCIC) consider that Grenada could diversify its economy by providing a platform for companies looking to outsource their IT services.</p>

<p>In December 2020, the World Bank approved a US$25 million Grenada COVID-19 Crisis Response and Fiscal Management Development Policy Credit to support the country’s efforts to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in the short term and enhance long-term sustainability.</p>

<span class="number">5.2 </span>2.2.  Existing Economic Sectors</h3>

<h4>2.2.1.  Context</h4>

<p>Every aspect of a SIDS’s economy can be considered as being linked to the maritime economy because of the dependence on maritime actors in importing necessary equipment and exporting produce to local and wider markets.</p>

<p>The tourism and transport sectors are to be the main drivers of growth, along with continued recovery in the agriculture sector. The tourism sector expanded in 2018. Stay-over arrivals rose 10.3%, with all major source markets increasing, including a 27% increase in cruise ship passenger arrivals. This growth in turn fuels growth in the hotel and restaurant sector, which is further supported by regional and international events, such as the Carriacou Boat Regatta, Grenada Invitational Athletics Meet, Dive Fest, Pure Grenada Music Festival and SpiceMas.</p>

<p>The construction sector continues to be a major source of economic activity and employment. Key public and private construction projects are fuelling this sector, including the Airport expansion, St. George’s University, Silver Sands Resort and the Parliament Building, as well as projects under the UK-Caribbean Infrastructure Fund. This sector shows no signs of slowing down (Ministry of Finance, 2018)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Private Education is the largest contributor to GDP, constituting approximately 19.3 percent in 2018, and has also been one of the main drivers of economic growth in recent years (Ministry of Finance, 2018).</p>

Primary energy consumption is dominated by transportation (~50%), followed by the power sector (40%). There is no oil and gas production in Grenada’s waters although there are exploration activities. Biomass is widely used, with wood used for cooking in residential and rural areas. Bagasse is produced and used by the sugarcane industry and wastes from nutmeg processing also have potential to be used as fuel in steam turbine generation plants<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.

      <td>The main port for Grenada is in St. George’s. It has the capacity to handle cargo and cruise passengers in two distinct areas and with cargo handling and container storage areas. Other ports of entry are: Prickly Bay; Port of Grenville; Tyrell Bay; Port of Hillsborough; Port of St. Davids; and Le Phare Bleu. Grenville is located on the east of Grenada and has two jetties which cater predominantly for small boats and ferry passengers. Prickly Bay and St. David’s are on the south coast of Grenada; both cater for leisure craft, including large yachts. The Osprey Ferry docks in Tyrell Bay are the site of a departure / arrival building alongside a large boatyard and marina. A future upgrade of Hillsborough port in Carriacou is planned to allow berthing and handling of passengers of international and regional ferries. The construction of a sister ferry terminal in Sauteurs (in the north of the main island of Grenada), is being considered to link the two islands together. There are no ports on Petite Martinique, although there are several jetties. There are no large-ship building shipyard, drydock or assembly facilities in Grenada, although there are companies offering construction of sailing vessels and a small shipyard in Carriacou. Boat building is a key historic industry in Carriacou and a key economic contributor in the outer islands. Capability exists to make traditional boats, fishing boats, yachts and 20ft long speed boats. The yachting and leisure craft sector is booming. Grenada is considered to be below the hurricane belt and only charges mooring fees in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), creating an influx of yachts that moor up in locations such as Carriacou and Petite Martinique, during the Caribbean hurricane season. Many moor up in mangrove areas and seabed habitats causing a lot of damage. Mooring fees could be levied for this to pay for re-creation of these habitats, and / or the installation of less damaging fixed moorings. The cruise ship sector continues to grow and receives strong support from the Government. Grenada attracts yachts, tourism and fishing vessels due to the skills and capacity of the boatyards, the relative safety of mooring in Grenada and the abundance of well stocked chandlers. Grenada Port Authority (GPA) is the National Maritime Authority, responsible for dealing with all IMO regulations, management and operations of Government owned ports and regulating privately owned ports. The GPA is part of the Ministry of Finance. Industry members are represented by the National Shipping Association of Grenada.</td>

Approximately 70% of landings are tuna / tuna-like species that are mainly exported. Demersal fin fish making up a further 22%. Part of the production is exported intra-regionally to islands such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, especially from Carriacou. The crustacean fishery is very small but high value; mainly of Caribbean spiny lobster, queen conch and sea turtles. There is a co-management arrangement with St. Vincent and the Grenadines for lobsters / conch and a reciprocal arrangement needs to be set between the two nations (fishers from Union Island have family on Petite Martinique and Carriacou etc.). There are 45 landing sites around the islands, seven of which are primary landing sites with fish market and port facilities, storage, ice making and vessel berths. Six of these sites are on Grenada, with the seventh on Carriacou. There are four processing plants which cater mainly for fresh fish exports. The main landing sites are Grenville (25%), Gouyave (22%), Carriacou &amp; Petite Martinique (18%), Grand Mal (12%), Melville Street (11%), other secondary sites (8%), Victoria (2%), Duquesne and Sauteurs (1% each) (FAO, 2007)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>. Gouyave has historically been the fishing capital of Grenada. The majority of fish caught is exported from the mainland.

There is a draft National Fisheries Policy in place and fisheries are included in the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (2016), Blue Growth Masterplan (2016) and Marine Protected Area management plans, but there is no formal fisheries management plan. The National Fisheries Policy requires updating and finalising. Grenada is a member of the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM). The Department of Fisheries (DoF), a unit of the Ministry of Sports, Culture and the Arts, Fisheries and Co-operatives, oversees the sector. Approximately 80% of the fleet is registered and licensed. Only Grenadian registered vessels are allowed to fish in Grenada’s waters.</td>

Over-extraction resulted in severe beach erosion and negative effects to coastal infrastructure and marine habitats and the practice was banned. Telescope Point remained the only designated beach site for sand mining but this was also closed in 2009 due to detrimental effects to the eastern coastline. More recently (2013) the government considered allowing beach sand extraction to start again. Sand extraction remains illegal, except by the GCEPC from three permitted locations - Galby and Bacolet Bay in St David and The Canals of Mt Rodney in St Patrick (NOW Grenada, 2018).

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>3. Cross Cutting Issues</h2>

<p>A number of issues cut across the different economic sectors previously highlighted and deserve consideration in their own right. Individually, they are significant enough for SIDS with a small and static population, a geographically-expansive but constrained resource area and highly volatile and changing geomorphology. However, their inter-connections increase their individual effects: as a result, these interactions need to be actively considered as part of the recommendations contained within an MEP.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>3.1.  Regional Organisations in the Caribbean</h3>

<p>Countries in the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR) have a strong tradition of working together to achieve shared goals and this is a particular feature in relation to ocean governance and management. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM), is an economic bloc of 14 member countries that allows for the implementation of common approaches and collaboration including the use of marine resources. CARICOM has several associated agencies that deal with issues of relevance to maritime economy sectors or concerns, including the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC), Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) and the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH).</p>

<p>The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) was established by several CARICOM states. These countries share a common approach to policy areas such as trade, health, education and the environment, including matters relating to the sea and its resources. The OECS also provides the basis for the delivery of the Principles of Environmental Sustainability under the St. George’s Declaration, making it a significant driver to achieve SDGs in the Eastern Caribbean.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>3.2.  Current State of Marine Planning and Management in Grenada</h3>

<p>The Government of Grenada is very aware of the need for marine planning and management and has undertaken several national initiatives, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Policy</li>
  <li>Ridge to Reef (R2R) Initiative</li>
  <li>National Adaptation Plan (NAP)</li>
  <li>Marine Protected Areas Programme</li>
  <li>Blue Growth Strategic Masterplan</li>
</ul>

<p>Grenada is working towards designating 25% of coastal areas as MPAs; there are currently four MPAs.</p>

<p>In 2013, the OECS approved and adopted the Eastern Caribbean Regional Ocean Policy (ECROP) to promote a common approach to ocean governance in all member states and mandated that each member develop a National Ocean Policy (NOP) to support the overarching regional policy. The ECROP has a number of priorities and goals, many of which are synergistic with the SDGs and therefore of relevance to the maritime / blue economy. As part of the OECS, Grenada is fully integrated into the ECROP programme and is actively developing a National Ocean Policy (NOP) within the ECROP framework and policies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>secure access to resources – clearly defined maritime boundaries, monitoring, compliance, surveillance
&amp; enforcement</li>
  <li>adopt multiple-use ocean planning and integrated management</li>
  <li>maintain and improve ecosystem integrity</li>
  <li>promote public awareness, participation, and accountability</li>
  <li>promote social and economic development</li>
  <li>support research and capacity building</li>
  <li>build resilience and manage uncertainty</li>
</ul>

<p>The NOP will create a framework for integrated planning and management of the marine space and activities from 2020 to 2035 to deliver Grenada’s NOP vision:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Our marine and coastal resources are sustainably managed to maximise the potential of the blue economy, ensure resilience to climate impacts, protect and restore marine ecosystems and nurture our natural and cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Grenada’s NOP is based on 12 overarching principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Island Systems Management (ISM)</li>
  <li>Access and benefit sharing</li>
  <li>Ecosystem Based Management (EBM)</li>
  <li>Precautionary approach</li>
  <li>Environmental stewardship</li>
  <li>Environmental liability</li>
  <li>Sustainable Development</li>
  <li>Transboundary cooperation</li>
  <li>Public and Private Participation</li>
  <li>Good governance</li>
  <li>Use of sound science and best practice</li>
  <li>Gender Equity and Inclusivity</li>
</ul>

<p>The Island Systems Management (ISM) concept was developed by the OECS and recognises the particular characteristics of islands; the need to take a systemic view across land and sea. It is a multidisciplinary, integrated approach using adaptive management to address conflict in resource use and provide policies to control the impacts of human intervention. It is closely related to, and builds on, approaches in ICZM and R2R.</p>

<p>A National Ocean Governance Committee (NOGC) comprising representatives from relevant public bodies will be established to deliver, monitor progress, and be accountable for ensuring that actions in the NOP are carried out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>3.3.  Weather events and Climate Change</h3>

<p>Grenada is characterised by mountainous terrain with extensive corals and mangroves. It has a humid, tropical climate with approximately 3% of its land area at sea level, including the main towns and key socio-economic facilities. Grenada is generally considered to be below the Caribbean hurricane belt, but it is vulnerable to tropical storms, occasional hurricanes and storm surges. The hurricane season is from June to November.</p>

<p>Coral reefs are an important source of income for Grenada providing tourism, recreation and fishing opportunities. They are also vital for protecting the island against adverse weather events such as storms and hurricanes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that coral ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to climate change as they are subject to rising ocean surface temperatures, leading to coral bleaching and acidification of marine waters.</p>

<p>There are two distinct rainfall patterns - the dry season typically runs from January to May and the rainy season from June to December. Carriacou and Petite Martinique generally experience lower levels of rainfall and can suffer severe drought conditions. Floods are mostly associated with storm surges in low coastal areas, which also cause erosion. Landslides are a risk during the rainy season in the mountain regions. The Coastal Vulnerability and Risk Assessment Project for Grenada shows that the country is highly vulnerable to sea level rise, and that there</p>

<p>is potential for inundation of land and flooding<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup>, which would significantly affect commercial activities, human settlements and infrastructure (airport, ports, tourism), as well as causing significant erosion, and potential disappearance of beaches. The direct effects of sea level rise on agriculture are less severe, although some areas are already experiencing saline intrusion to coastal aquifers.</p>

<p>Changes in precipitation and temperature caused by climate change raise concerns for water availability, which would impact farmers, especially those growing fruits and vegetables, while more erratic rainfall patterns could lead to periods of drought and / or heavy rains eroding soil, damaging crops and increasing agricultural runoff.</p>

<p>Grenada submitted its first National Communications (NC1) including its greenhouse gas inventory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2000. The country signed and ratified the Paris Agreement and submitted its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2016. In 2020, Grenada submitted its second NDC to the UNFCCC as confirmation of the ambitious 2030 NDC target of a 40% reduction in GHG emissions below 2010 levels (achieving this target is conditional on external funding). Grenada’s NDC highlights the country’s commitment towards a low carbon and climate resilient development pathway.</p>

<h4>3.3.1.  Opportunities and plans for climate action</h4>

<p>Grenada has a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) which is the central delivery mechanism for climate resilience andadaptation. It is a means of identifying medium and long-term adaptation needs and developing and implementing strategies and programmes to address those needs.</p>

<h4>Mitigation:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>2030 target – 40% absolute emission reduction compared to base year of 2010; 2025 target year – 30% absolute emission reduction compared to base year of 2010</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>demand-side Efficiency – Emissions reductions in the building sector through retrofitting (20%) and energy efficiency building codes (30%); and 20% emissions reduction in the hotel sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>transport (land and marine) – 20% emissions reduction in the transport sector by 2025. Gasoline and diesel taxes; introduction of biofuel blends; and fuel-efficient standards for vehicles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>waste – Construction of a controlled (or capped) landfill to compact and cover waste and collect methane gas generated for electricity production; employment of waste reduction, sorting and recycling activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>forestry – national obligation to protect 17% of its terrestrial area as part of the Aichi Target and 20% under the Caribbean Challenge initiative</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Adaptation:</h4>

<p>Coastal zone management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>undertake a detailed mapping of the coastal features to provide a definition of the coast</li>
  <li>re-established its beach monitoring program under new terms of reference and stronger institutional backing</li>
  <li>undertake several community ecosystem based adaptation actions including coral restoration, mangrove rehabilitation, all with alternative livelihood implications</li>
  <li>Water Resource Management – complete a vulnerability assessment and develop a national adaptation plan and action plan for the water sector, mapping and water quality testing of informal water sources</li>
  <li>water conservation and re-use – rainwater harvesting in some remote communities to improve water collection and storage</li>
</ul>

<p>Cross-cutting aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhancing the institutional framework on climate change - establish an integrated and coordinated approach to addressing climate change to help minimise capacity gaps in the system while ensuring coherence and cohesion at the local and national level</li>
  <li>building the resilience of communities – engage community groups and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the participation of activities geared at building climate resilience</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>3.4.  Ecosystem Services</h3>

<p>Marine and coastal environments, and their supporting ecosystems, support a diverse range of sea life that is important for global biodiversity and play a significant role in Grenada’s economy and way of life. Maintaining the health and biodiversity of marine ecosystems in Grenada is fundamental for the services that they currently provide, for supporting cultural and social well-being and for future sustainable development opportunities.</p>

<p>Current ecosystem services include subsistence food provision from fisheries and aquaculture, shore stabilisation and coastal protection provided by mangroves and carbon sequestration from seagrass and tidal marshes. The protection and preservation of coral reefs is of critical importance, both from an ecological perspective and for their role in supporting a tourist industry that depends largely on healthy marine and coastal ecosystems.</p>

<p>Degradation of marine ecosystems presents a major threat to livelihoods, health and well-being. In the marine area, these come from the effects of climate change, including ocean acidification and coral bleaching, physical damage from increasingly intense hurricanes and the growth of maritime activities and land-based pollution.</p>

<h4>3.4.1.  Economic contribution</h4>

<p>Coastal and marine ecosystems provide a variety of ecological functions that directly and indirectly translate to economic services and value to humans. However, the value of ecosystem services is often difficult to quantify as it is not easily captured in ‘traditional’ economic balance sheets. It may not be immediately visible in markets, business transactions or national economic accounts and it may only be perceived when services are diminished or lost (MACBIO, 2015)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup>. The importance of natural assets can be disregarded if they are under-valued and, therefore, they may become overused or depleted. In turn, this may have real and significant, if unintended, knock-on effects to economic sectors.</p>

<p>Grenada has conducted a number of protected area ecosystem valuation exercises. There is currently an initiative between the Environment Division and the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI) to carry out a country-wide National Ecosystem Assessment of Grenada for 2019 - 2023 (CANARI, 2020)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup>. The National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) also considers ecosystem services for the blue economy, with stakeholders expressing concerns about skills gaps which pose challenges in accessing new technologies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>3.5.  Coastal and Disaster Risk Management</h3>

<p>The National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is the body responsible for the overall management of disasters and emergency situations in Grenada.</p>

<h4>3.5.1.  Natural Hazards</h4>

<p>Historical records indicate that Grenada has been adversely affected by a range of natural hazards such as droughts, floods, wind, storm surges, tropical cyclones, landslides and seismic hazards (earthquakes and tsunamis).</p>

<p>There is the potential for serious adverse impacts to coastal communities and infrastructure from flooding, sea-level rise and inundation, especially during storm surges. Serious disruption of social and economic life could be expected to occur as a result of natural hazards. Coastal erosion from SLR and extreme events could disrupt coastal villages such as Gouyave, Grand Mal, Duquesne, Soubise and Marquis. Roads through these communities and other areas such as Carriacou are at or below sea level in some cases. These roads could experience flooding and become impassable during high tides and experience severe damage during storm surges. Maurice Bishop Airport is considered the most at risk CARICOM airport with regard to SLR<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There is a desire to increase development in the coastal zone to support government policy targets associated with sustainable tourism. An area of critical importance is the threat of beach erosion to the majority of the existing tourism facilities in areas located near the coastline (e.g. Grand Anse and Carenage), where significant land and beach losses are predicted due to sea level rise (SLR)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grand Anse: land loss ~ 206,000m2 and beach loss of over 54,509m2. Resorts impacted in this region include the Allamanda Beach Resort, Coyaba Beach Hotel, Spice Island Resort and Flamboyant Hotel (currently being renovated under a new name)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Carenage (harbour in the capital): land loss of almost 19,000m2. There are no beaches in this area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marquis: land loss of over 9,000m2 and beach loss of over 4,000m<sub>2</sub></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soubise: land loss of over 13,700m2 and beach loss of over 3,000m<sub>2</sub></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Physical Planning Unit (PPU) is the authority responsible for planning and development control and the protection of the natural and cultural heritage. Although its mandate includes forward planning, almost all of its operations are focused on development control. As there is no up to date National Physical Development Plan, the PPU is operating without any planning guidance or land zoning development orders in place. The PPU manages this process by consulting extensively within government to ensure the national policy direction is taken forward.</p>

<p>Grenada and St. Lucia have implemented an insurance scheme specifically designed to assist the fishing industry in the event of extreme weather events; Caribbean Oceans and Aquaculture Sustainability Facility (COAST) insurance, with support from the CME Programme, World Bank and Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM). The insurance has been developed by the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Segregated Portfolio Company (CCRIF SPC). The insurance encourages and incentivises the sustainable management of fisheries, policy reforms and climate-smart fisheries and offers cover for fishers and related businesses (e.g. vendors) in the event of extreme weather events such as tropical storms and hurricanes. The government is encouraging all vessels to be insured and will only provide licences if the fisher has insurance. Furthermore, the Grenada Development Bank will only provide vessel loans if the fisher is licensed and insured.</p>

<h4>3.5.2.  Man-made Hazards</h4>

<p>In addition to natural hazards there are a number of man-made hazards such as fires, pollution, toxic spills and accidents, including forest fires and oil spill events. The impact of an oil spill could be potentially devastating to Grenada’s natural resources in terms of destruction of beaches, coral reefs and marine life.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>3.6. Gender equality</h3>

<p>The UN SDG 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. There are nine targets, with at least one indicator each, that aim to achieve the overarching goal. Maritime industries are traditionally male-dominated areas, particularly in bedrock sectors of fishing, ports / shipping, marine aggregates. Commercial and offshore fisheries remain a male-dominated sector worldwide. Women’s roles and activities in these bedrock sectors tend to be in supporting onshore roles, such as fish processing, food preparation and service sector roles.</p>

<p>The UN has highlighted the gender equality issues around the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the majority of caregivers, at home, in communities and in health care, are women. Although those most affected by COVID-19 are reportedly men, the elderly, and people with chronic diseases and weak immune systems, women and girls are disproportionately impacted by both the disease and the public health measures to contain it. Women are at increased risk of infection due to their caregiving role; and loss of livelihood, due to their jobs tending to be in service sectors that have been closed; or in part time or informal work.</p>

<p>Women’s role in subsistence nearshore / coastal fishing is often unpaid and, therefore, undervalued in economic data. A move towards valuing ecosystem services and the economic contribution that ecosystems make in supporting the economy will help to highlight the value of the roles of women to the economy. The stewardship and management of ecosystem services and the creation of new small scale business opportunities can also provide additional opportunities for women and more rural or remote island communities, such as through small scale aquaculture.</p>

<p>Tourism is one maritime economy sector that offers a wider range of opportunities for women to take an active part in the economy. The opportunity to diversify and expand the tourism offering creates the opportunity for women and rural / remote communities to engage in the economy. The development of this Maritime Economy Plan has included consideration of how gender equality currently affects the maritime economy sectors as part of the multicriteria analysis carried out (see section 4.1).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>4.	Analysis and Plan Development</h2>

<p>This Plan has been produced as a result of several months of desk work combined with a consultative mission to Grenada, during which intensive discussions were scheduled with a wide range of government, NGO, and private sector stakeholders. It is therefore very much a strategic overview of Grenada’s maritime economic potential. Often such swift approaches and taking a ‘helicopter view’ can be a highly beneficial mechanism for succinctly cutting through detail and prioritising needs. The Maritime Economy Plan was subject to review, feedback and update during 2020 / 2021, with the Ministry of Sports, Culture and the Arts, Fisheries &amp; Co-operatives acting as the focal point for engagement.</p>

<p>This document is presented as a basis for further dialogue and to support Grenada along the difficult but necessary pathway towards the realisation of a blue economy.</p>

<p>The Plan was subject to wide-ranging scrutiny and consultation and following associated revisions, it is anticipated that it will ultimately assist Grenada in the implementation of its National Ocean Policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>4.1.  Methods</h3>

<p>The following methods were developed and applied to assist consultation and discussions with stakeholders and the analysis of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to help gather information during country visits and seek the views and opinions of stakeholders to inform the development of the Maritime Economy Plan, a series of structured questions was developed. Questions were grouped by sector (e.g. fisheries) or theme / issue that is common to many SIDS or that has the potential to affect the maritime economy (e.g. disaster risk, infrastructure and engineering)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where appropriate, stakeholders were aided in the process of prioritising maritime sector issues with the help of a Card Sorting exercise (see Figure 4). ‘Card sorting’ prioritisation of maritime economy sectors and discussions of priorities were held with stakeholders, either individually, in groups, or in workshops. Discussions focussed on four ‘key drivers’ for the country’s maritime economy, their relative importance and any potential tensions between the key drivers, to understand the over-arching issues of importance affecting all maritime economy sectors. Figure 4 overleaf presents the key drivers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information collected through the structured interview questions; desktop study of published and grey literature and reports and data provided by the departments and ministries contacted was subject to a bespoke multicriteria analysis developed to help inform the maritime economy plan process. The multicriteria analysis was termed a GESTER analysis (see Table 4).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>traditional and emerging maritime economy sectors were subject to the GESTER of the current situation or status of the sector, considering both positive and negative aspects of the sector. The analysis served to expose the process to basic environmental and social screening</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The criteria against which each sector was considered are shown in Table 4. Card sorting (Figure 4) provided a series of lenses for examining different sectors. The Maritime Economy Plan was then drafted following this analysis.</p>

<h4>Figure 4 – Card sorting key drivers</h4>

<p>Building a vibrant and productive maritime / blue economy may be assisted by concerted focus upon key maritime economic sectors. These sectors may then be aligned with a series of over-arching Principles that once adhered to will assist a country to follow a clear and inclusive pathway to sustainable maritime economic growth (see Figure 5).</p>

<p>The United Nations has adopted ocean development as part of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 14 aims to “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.” The blue economy interlinks with the majority of the SDGs, including SDG5, SDG11, SDG8, SDG7 and others. Aquatic and marine resources play a crucial role in supporting maritime economic sectors. Progress towards a blue economy can help achieve a range of SDGs. Figure 6 illustrates some of the linkages between blue economy development and the 17 SDGs<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>5. Key messages, priorities and actions</h2>

<p>This section of the plan sets out the key messages and priorities for the maritime economy of Grenada. It highlights the overarching messages and key drivers for the country and for each of the maritime economy sectors, taking account of the current economic activities, opportunities and risks and consultation with stakeholders.</p>

<p>The importance of key existing and developing policies and plans in Grenada, particularly the NOP, NAP and ICZM plan is recognised. Where the priorities, actions and recommendations in this MEP help to achieve or link to policies in the NOP, the relevant NOP goals are identified.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>5.1.  Key messages and Key drivers for Grenada’s Maritime Economy</h3>

<p>The overarching key issues driving Grenada’s maritime economy are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>marine tourism is playing an increasing role in the prosperity of Grenada and needs to be managed in a sustainable way to ensure its viability in the long term. In particular, the impacts of yachting and cruise tourism need to be fully understood</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is the potential for new maritime activities to add to the economic prosperity of Grenada. The NOP is designed to recognise the potential for these new activities. For example, potential oil and gas extraction, mariculture and marine renewables all need to be governed by policies that ensure they are carried out in an environmentally sustainable way, should they be activities that Grenada wishes to strategically pursue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the developing NOP will act as a planning policy guidance document to help implement actions and recommendations in this MEP and other policies, such as the cabinet-endorsed ICZM Policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is no National Maritime Transport Policy. This will be needed to meet International Maritime Organisation (IMO) requirements around safety at sea, pollution response and flag, coastal and port state measures and will help to address some of the water quality / port waste issues in the country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>efforts to improve public awareness of marine and coastal safety (including boating, swimming etc.) are important to address a perceived cultural fear of the sea, which is limiting the realisation of the opportunities of a blue economy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>5.2.  Priorities</h3>

<p>The priorities here are cross-sectoral and identify where actions are required to move towards a sustainable blue economy while also implementing the Grenada National Ocean Policy (NOP), deliver the NOP Vision and realise the overarching ECROP polices, to which Grenada is signed up. These priorities and themes are picked up in many of the actions identified for maritime economy sectors in section 5.3.</p>

<h4>Priority 1 – Collaboration</h4>

<p>To create the necessary platform for future collaboration amongst all sectors in Grenada, there is a need to coordinate activity within a formally established National Ocean Governance Committee (NOGC) and improve linkages between current policies and plans of relevance to Grenada’s marine space. This is a significant step in the implementation of the ECROP in Grenada and embedding the concept of the blue economy across government. Important initial actions for the NOGC are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>agree terms of reference and develop an operations guidance manual for the NOGC by relevant bodies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>formalise the annual interim review of the Grenada NOP. Identify clear actions for key organisations in Grenada to provide information on regional and international commitments and sectoral analyses. Produce an annual Ocean Status Progress Report that can be used to compile a 5 yearly Ocean Status Report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review the recommendations and actions set out in this MEP to ensure Grenada specific guidance is prepared and disseminated for inter-departmental mainstreaming into sectoral work plans. Guidance should be articulated in a way that it is understood and able to be incorporated into government departmental business with minimal impact</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>oversee and guide the ongoing production of Marine Spatial Plans and Coastal Master Plans for Grenada to support the implementation of the NOP and actions in this MEP that the NOGC prioritises</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following actions are designed to improve cross-departmental understanding in Grenada and facilitate collaboration, by ensuring a common understanding and approach to marine management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that a ridge to reef (Islands Systems Management) approach is adopted in the development of the NOP, Marine Spatial Plans, Coastal Master Plans and the delivery of MEP actions identified as priority for Grenada</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>carry out a review of the current regulatory system of marine environmental management and requirements of the National Environmental Policy and Management Strategy (NEMS), identifying gaps and actions to take to improve regulations. This will help provide the basis for the coordinating mechanism with ICZM to provide a link between land and marine planning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>undertake a natural capital evaluation of Grenada’s marine and coastal environment to understand the value of marine ecosystem services overall to inform decision making and marine management. The findings should be included in the Ocean Status Reports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish a clearly communicated, co-ordinating mechanism for the implementation of the MEP</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Priority 2 – Capacity</h4>

<p>Human capacity and skills are key challenges to the implementation of the MEP and mainstreaming the concepts of the blue economy and marine spatial management across all departments and agencies in Grenada. Outside of government, there is a need to focus on growing skills for new jobs in the maritime economy, St. George’s University has a key role to play in this. An urgent review of Grenada’s institutional capacity needs is required in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fisheries: fishing is important for both local food security and income generation in Grenada. Fisheries management is challenged by limited human resources and operational capacity for research, monitoring, compliance and enforcement. Understanding the capacity challenges will inform the development of a revised Fisheries Policy and action plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marine protected areas: review existing MPA boundaries and management in Grenada. This will inform the management systems and capacity requirements needed for existing MPAs, the need to update them, to inform the designation of any new MPAs and ongoing management requirements for all new and future MPAs in Grenada.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marine research: there is no strategic overview of marine research requirements for Grenada, or an understanding of the capacity, capability and partnerships available to inform, undertake and disseminate marine research. Research and the dissemination of findings (linking to Priority 4 - Communication) is important to inform and develop sustainable marine management and Grenada’s maritime economy sectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>land and water management and use planning: the link between land use management and inland water resources and flood management to coastal water quality and ecosystems services is recognised in the Island Systems Management approach, however more resources are needed to implement this practically including through the Land Policy and Integrated Resource Water Management Plan (in the process of gaining Cabinet approval)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Priority 3: Commitment</h4>

<p>Future funding to tackle marine issues will be dependent on Grenada being able to demonstrate, through this MEP and the Grenada NOP, that funding will lead to a beneficial legacy for citizens and the marine environment. It is of importance, therefore, that governmental commitment ensures that the implementation of the MEP is fully costed, suitably aligned to government sectoral budgets and endorsed by all Grenada NOGC members (see Priority 1 – collaboration). In addition, finance and co-financing mechanisms must be clearly identified and disbursement modalities secured for relevant MEP delivery.</p>

<h4>Priority 4: Communication</h4>

<p>Increasing public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the importance of the ocean, the Grenada NOP and the MEP through education and outreach is an important short-term action. This should embrace the creation of a process for active public participation in planning, policy and decision making which is likely to include the need for a public awareness, education and outreach strategy to be developed and implemented. This builds on cross-departmental dissemination and awareness raising (see Priority 1 - collaboration) and extends to businesses, communities and the general public across Grenada. Developing and improving skills and training for jobs is important - both academic and vocational training, particularly if new areas are to be made the most of e.g. mariculture, expansion of tourism. St. George’s University has a role to play here.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>5.3.  Action Plans</h3>

<p>Actions, primary actors and desired outcomes are presented for each maritime economy sector in the following pages. Recommendations and actions have been drafted to be relevant and applicable to both women and men, and to all of Grenada’s communities. Key messages and recommendations that could provide opportunities for women are highlighted. Each sector is given a prioritisation for action based on the categorisation below.</p>

<p>Priorities have been categorised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>square: this work is urgent. It is critical to both GDP and /or Grenada’s ability to adapt to climate change</li>
  <li>circle: this work is new / needs attention. Sustainably developing it further now would help to build a future sustainable maritime economy ‘game changer’ for Grenada</li>
  <li>triangle: this work is well established and already very important to Grenada’s blue economy. Attention to implementation plan suggestions will further strengthen the sector</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.3.1.  Coastal Development</h4>

<p>Status – Bedrock (Established)</p>

<p>SUGGESTED PRIORITY: This work is urgent. It is critical to both GDP and /or the ability to adapt to climate change</p>

<p>Human capacity and skills are a constraint in the management and planning for sustainable coastal development. There is a need for better coordination between decision making bodies.</p>

<p>Legislation and planning controls are a constraint to planning and managing development sustainably and do not facilitate cross-departmental coordination; there is currently no overarching Environment Act, EIA Regulations are in draft and there is no up to date National Physical Development Plan in place.</p>

<p>The Department of Environment’s lack of legislative power means that they rely on influencing, advising and guiding others to ensure environmental compliance through other delivery routes. Given the lack of a legislative framework, environmental policy documents are very important to the Department of Environment (DoE) to help direct others in a suitable manner.</p>

<p>MPA designation and management is the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries (DoF). The PPU is not directly involved in MPA designation but the presence of MPAs affects planning policy and activities for which the PPU is responsible.</p>

<p>The PPU does not have the expertise / capacity to assess coastal / marine applications or Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), although the PPU does consult other government departments on applications and EIAs for their input into the decision-making process.</p>

<p>In order to meet current challenges and realise future opportunities the following considerations should be taken into account by decision makers with regards to future coastal development in Grenada:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider all relevant climate resilience or coastal management plans or policies when developing any coastal or marine spatial plans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider a precautionary and risk-based approach, including the use of environmental impact assessments to ensure that activities and developments in the coastal zone are climate resilient and sustainable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that policy and regulatory delivery is integrated between relevant ICZM policy and the new NOP (2019), considering links to the Draft Land Policy and Integrated Water Resource Management Plan for an Island Systems Management (ISM) approach to help address water resources and flood risk management at all levels and pollution control in the nearshore area from both coastal and land-based sources</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Parks and Protected Areas (NPPAs) on land need to be preserved and co-managed with the marine environment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>coastal access rights to the water is a significant issue. Clear policy needs to be developed to ensure standardisation and transparency regarding access</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that evidence-based decision making is applied for coastal developments. This includes ensuring a robust Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) framework that is adhered to. It is important that an EIA is updated or a new EIA is undertaken for development extensions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>landscape management and reversal of land degradation issues should be considered for all coastal development schemes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grenada would benefit from introducing a decision -making framework to support Rapid Assessment in development control</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Improving legislative powers, clear strategic development planning and improving skills and capacity to regulate
and enforce planning and development is imperative to achieve sustainable coastal development.</p>

<p>[Grenada Coastal Development]</p>

<h4>5.3.2. Shipping and Ports</h4>

<p>Status – Bedrock (Established)</p>

<p>Suggested priority: This work is well established and already very important to Grenada’s sustainable maritime economy. Attention to implementation plan suggestions will further strengthen the sector.</p>

<p>Coordination with other decision makers is very important for the Grenada Port Authority (GPA) - decisions both at a policy and delivery level that affect port operations or the marine environment can be made without GPA knowledge.</p>

<p>The ability to monitor, control and respond to human activity at sea is fundamental to the ability to manage and plan marine resources, protect the marine environment and enforce the rule of law. Grenada must ensure that adequate charts and hydrographic services are available in line with national, regional and international commitments. Capacity building, regional cooperation and training, and ensuring effective hydrographic governance are required to understand what is occurring within Grenada’s marine space. Capacity in both staff and equipment / vessels are required to respond to this information for effective compliance and enforcement and emergency response.</p>

<p>Key messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leisure / yacht and cruise traffic is predicted to increase and is being encouraged to grow the tourism sector. The requirements needed to support this growth sustainably need to be considered strategically, including:
    <ul>
      <li>port / harbour and onshore infrastructure and facilities to support the growth e.g. potential new shipping routes, berthing facilities, accommodation, transport, need for increased cargo / shipping, etc</li>
      <li>boat building is important for maritime trade and there is a wish to maintain and grow boat building projects</li>
      <li>this will need to link to both facilities and human resources / training</li>
      <li>ability of existing and future port / harbour facilities to increase resilience to / adapt to climate change as they are developed / expand</li>
      <li>spatial, social and environmental impacts of predicted increases and the need to manage / mitigate these. This includes both terrestrial and marine issues, such as navigational safety, access to areas for other activities (e.g. fishing), conservation and management (e.g. MPAs, reefs, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>port waste / waste water facilities are not sufficient to cope with existing levels of traffic – addressing future growth requirements is imperative to prevent environmental and human health impacts</li>
  <li>capacity building for GPA, DoE, DoF and PPU to strategically plan, manage, monitor and enforce port / harbour development, operation and navigation. This requires staff, training and equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Water quality / waste management controls are likely to become increasingly important as the tourism industry grows, all forms of marine traffic increase and more pressure is put on port / harbour / marine facilities.</p>

<p>[Grenada Shipping and ports]</p>

<h4>5.3.3.  Fisheries</h4>

<p>Status – Bedrock (Established)</p>

<p>Suggested priority: This work is well established and already very important to Grenada’s sustainable maritime economy. Attention to implementation plan suggestions will further strengthen the sector.</p>

<p>The National Fisheries Policy remains in draft, and is centred on five themes:</p>

<p>1:	Enhancing the status and capability of fishers</p>

<p>2:	Sustainable stewardship &amp; conservation of aquatic resources</p>

<p>3:	Realising the development potential inherent within the fisheries sector</p>

<p>4:	Maintaining the sector’s role in sustaining livelihoods of the poor</p>

<p>5:	Generating a positive interaction with Grenada’s wider economic community</p>

<p>Key messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fisheries management, stock assessment, management plans, monitoring and enforcement capacity is required to support existing fisheries, MPAs and leisure fishing; and to ensure the development of new markets and tourism fishing is sustainable. Science-based management plans are required and the draft National Fisheries Policy requires updating and finalising</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increase collaboration with neighbouring island states in relation to their involvement in fisheries and the trans-boundary nature of fish stocks – actively engage through CARICOM’s Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) and the Caribbean Common Fisheries Policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MPA management supports both fisheries and tourism. The designation and management of MPAs needs to support the co-existence of both sectors. Cross-government engagement and cooperation is required. Access to important traditional fish resources / for food source should be supported, where fishing practices are in line with management aims. Tourism development / leisure craft use of important fishing areas should not impact on habitat or fish stocks. EIA, water quality management, non-destructive mooring should be encouraged and enforced. Management / enforcement capacity is needed across government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the potential social, environmental and economic impacts of other activities and development on fishing and fisheries (e.g. spawning, nursery grounds) need to be considered (e.g. tourism, harbour, coastal development)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sport / leisure fishing management and enforcement is not on a par with commercial fisheries. As tourism grows this may impact key stocks. Leisure fishing vessels are not registered in the same way as commercial vessels; this needs to improve in order to manage / enforce this sector appropriately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support for the development of fisheries products and markets, including oceanic pelagic species and local inshore species. Training for longline and pelagic fishermen is required</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>training and development for fishers to improve safety, catch quality and non-destructive fishing methods - safety at sea, business and financial management, co-management with regulators, etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sargassum management is a cross-cutting issue affecting fisheries, tourism and ports / harbours – collaboration is needed across government and sector participants to address this, including research into management techniques and / or uses for Sargassum</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>[Grenada Fisheries]</p>

<h4>5.3.4.  Aquaculture</h4>

<p>Status – Emerging (Not Established)</p>

<p>Suggested priority: This work is new / needs attention. Sustainably developing it further now would help to build a future sustainable maritime economy ‘game changer’’ for Grenada.</p>

<p>The government is supportive of an increase in aquaculture and mariculture. There is a recognition that this needs to be done in a way that offers diversification for the fishing industry but does not compete directly with fishers.</p>

<p>Key messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opportunities for aquaculture development (tilapia, freshwater prawns and seamoss) as an alternative to capture fisheries should be assessed (via more detailed feasibility studies) and as an avenue for agricultural diversification</li>
  <li>aquaculture development – onshore and in coastal locations – is constrained by space and competition with other sectors. Collaboration is needed across government to consider strategic locations for all opportunities and the potential for co-location of activities</li>
  <li>gender related aspects in the aquaculture sector require further consideration</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.3.5.  Tourism</h4>

<p>Sector Status – Bedrock (Established)</p>

<p>Suggested priority: This work is well established and already very important to Grenada’s sustainable maritime economy. Attention to implementation plan suggestions will further strengthen the sector.</p>

<p>Tourism activities are the major contributor of income for the Grenadian economy and are central to coastal communities, supporting their quality of life, with many local businesses relying on the marine environment for their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Tourism is heavily reliant on the marine environment in terms of cruise ship tourism, beach side hotels, scuba diving, recreational bathing, yachting and competitive open-water swimming. The quality and status of the marine environment therefore has a significant impact on the value of this sector, depending on how tourists perceive the quality of the marine environment and the experience it offers, relative to other countries.</p>

<p>Key messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tourism development must be sustainable. There is considerable potential for growth (from emerging markets in China, Japan) and for growth to benefit other sectors in the supply chain (agriculture, fishing, construction, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintaining a high quality coastal and marine environment underpins the tourism sector. The government recognises the risks to the environment from tourism and to tourism from environmental degradation. Tourism developments should not adversely affect the environment or ecosystem services (natural coastal protection from reefs, water quality, fish stocks, etc.). A robust EIA, planning, building code and enforcement system is important, with capacity for the PPU to deliver / enforce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water quality poses a potential risk to sustainable tourism development – risks to environmental and human health. Water quality monitoring and improvements are required to meet regional / international standards for recreational water quality and to reduce the risk to ecosystems and food fisheries. By 2025, there is a need to significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, including land-based activities such as marine debris and nutrient pollution. It is important that management of water quality is considered with agriculture and land use management and the effects of pollution on human and ecosystem health as well as livelihoods. This links to priorities in the Coastal Development sector for the NOP to link with the Draft Land Policy and Integrated Water Resource Management Plan for an island systems management approach and capacity requirements to deliver this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support is needed to strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management and awareness of the benefits and impacts to coastal livelihoods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a holistic island systems management (ISM) approach is important to deliver tourism policy aims sustainably
– most infrastructure and coastal access is land-based but requires marine spatial planning to support access (cruise, leisure) and tourism activities (beaches, yachting). The coast is the gateway to the interior of the islands, which offers opportunities for the diversification of tourism activities away from mainly coastal / beach / marine based activities. ISM manages the interactions of tourism with other activities requiring access to shared spaces (shipping, fishing) and for supporting ecosystem services (water quality, fishing, coastal protection, beaches)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>natural capital valuation of marine tourism ecosystems and interactive Climate Smart public awareness activities will support ISM and sustainable tourism development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consideration and management of the carrying capacity of the marine, coastal and terrestrial environments in planning and managing the demand for new services or activities and predicted increases in visitor numbers is needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appetite for agro-tourism is high in Grenada and can play a role in regional and local tourism. Links between hiking, agro-tourism and ecosystem services should be explored. (This is a terrestrially driven policy but links to policies to expand / diversify coastal tourism sustainably)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sustainable tourism and recreation can only thrive with a well-managed, healthy and safe marine environment.</p>

<h4>5.3.6.  Energy (including Renewable Energy)</h4>

<p>Bedrock (Established) – diesel import / Emerging (Not Established) – renewables</p>

<p>Suggested priority: this work is well established and already very important to Grenada’s sustainable maritime economy. Attention to implementation plan suggestions will further strengthen the sector.</p>

<p>On a global scale Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) is attracting great technology and project development interest. SIDS can make great cases for piloting new technologies or showcasing new technological solutions, attracting investors and sponsors.</p>

<p>Grenada has potential access to geothermal energy, which is not available to many other Caribbean countries.</p>

<p>Key messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the government is committed to renewables and reducing carbon emissions. There are specific targets for improving efficiency in demand and production and for increasing renewables contribution to the energy generation mix</li>
  <li>exploration has identified a natural gas resource to the south of Grenada. While the government is keen to understand the extent of the resource available, an appropriate regulatory framework must be in place to allow full consideration of the environmental, social and economic benefits of any gas extraction activities before it is authorised. All relevant government departments with responsibility for assessing, permitting and monitoring these activities must be appropriately staffed and trained to deal with the specific technical issues associated with gas extraction and must work together to ensure joined up management - Ministry of Finance, Planning, Economic Development &amp; Physical Development, PPU, DoE, etc</li>
  <li>offshore renewables are of less priority than onshore renewables. Onshore renewables are much cheaper, with considerable potential. At a national level, the priority should be focussed on improving energy efficiency and low carbon energy generation</li>
  <li>careful analysis will be required for site selection (location) and environmental impact of renewable energy development</li>
  <li>there is an urgent requirement to update the National Energy Policy</li>
  <li>the transition towards the use of renewable energy requires multilateral funding support</li>
  <li>this is a terrestrially driven priority area but it will support the maritime economy</li>
</ul>

<p>There are opportunities for marine renewables, but the focus of low carbon, low cost energy generation should be a terrestrial-driven policy priority.</p>

<p>[Grenada Energy]</p>

<h4>5.3.7.  Ecosystem services</h4>

<p>Status - Emerging (Not Established)</p>

<p>Suggested priority: this work is new / needs attention. Sustainably developing it further now would help to build a future sustainable maritime economy ‘game changer’’ for Grenada.</p>

<p>While ecosystem services are ubiquitous and support both bedrock and emerging maritime economy sectors, their integration into decision making and attempts to quantify their value, are not yet mainstreamed. They are therefore described as ‘emerging’.</p>

<p>Key messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ecosystem services underpin the tourism industry, which is fundamentally important to the economy of Grenada. The sector also puts pressure on these ecosystem services from activities such as coastal development, water use, waste / waste water disposal, accidental / deliberate damage</li>
  <li>natural capital valuation is needed to understand the value of ecosystem goods and services and use this information to inform decision-making</li>
  <li>ensure that any coastal or marine spatial planning process aligns with existing mechanisms by considering areas and features of importance for nature conservation and wider biodiversity in developing policies and locations for other marine activities, and in permitting new development</li>
  <li>ISM is important to support the integration of ecosystem services and natural capital valuation into the decision making process, ensuring that all sectors are given sufficient consideration</li>
</ul>

<p>The value of ecosystem services needs to be better understood and incorporated into decision-making.</p>

<p>[Grenada ecosystem services]</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>6.1.  Transition to a Blue Economy</h3>

<p>Applying blue economy principles and strengthening the contribution that the maritime sector makes to national GDP is one of the most positive interventions that SIDS can make in response to climate change. With its mountainous hinterland and heavily populated coastal zone, Grenada is being squeezed by sea level rise and negative climate change impacts. The more that Grenada is able to look out to sea for its climate adaptation solutions the more resilient it will be. This approach will serve to truly embrace the vision of a Large Ocean State.</p>

<p>Figure 7 below shows an example of a desirable blue economy framework. This shift in the way of thinking about the maritime economy allows a country to move away from a linear, compartmentalised, and sectoral approach to ocean management with weak connections, linkages, and synergies between various scales of intervention (global, international, and national). It facilitates a move towards a more integrated, systemic, dynamic, inclusive, participatory, and ecosystem-based approach in which sectoral barriers are minimised, at both the participants’ and governance level. This new way of thinking recognises that environmental, social, and economic dimensions are intertwined and pursued collectively for all blue maritime economy activities.</p>

<p>The blue economy (of which this Maritime Economy Plan represents a key building block) adheres closely to the principles of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). This centres on the ecosystem approach and embeds the principles of the UNEP ‘Green Economy in a Blue World’ report and sustainable development. It takes into account the three pillars of environmental, economic, and social sustainability, as highlighted in the 2012 Rio+20 outcome document, ‘The Future We Want’, and the UN five-year Action Agenda 2012–2016.</p>

<p>[Figure 7 – A Desirable Blue Economy Framework]</p>

<p>The blue economy promotes the conservation of aquatic and marine ecosystems and the sustainable use and management of resources. It builds on principles of equity, low carbon development, resource efficiency, and social inclusion.</p>

<p>The concept integrates the blue economy sectors through a socially inclusive process aimed at sparking a structural transformation, promoting integrated development, and improved regional cooperation and coordination.</p>

<p>The transformative work required to move towards full application of Blue Economy Planning principles in Governmental Strategy, Policy and Implementation is potentially a difficult but necessary step. Whilst Blue Economy concepts are beginning to become mainstream, particularly across Island Nations, very few countries have begun to prepare national level Maritime Economy Plans, and all remain some way off implementation.</p>

<p>As a nation that is on the climate change front line, yet also growing in terms of overall national GDP Grenada is well placed to play an exemplary role in blue economic transformation. This MEP lastly explores briefly the critical subject of accessing finance and concludes via a brief review of potential situation and distance to travel in embedding the Principles of a Sustainable Maritime Economy in societal decision-making. This is presented diagrammatically in section 6.3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>6.2.  Accessing Ocean and Climate Finance</h3>

<p>A key benefit of strategic planning of any kind is that it can provide greater clarity and strength as a basis for coordinated bilateral and multilateral funding. This MEP has been drafted with an eye to potential funding streams and it is anticipated that following consultation and finalisation this plan may be used by the government to assist bid prioritisation and coordination.</p>

<p>Grenada already receives external funding support and has experienced success in this area. The following instruments and types of fund are likely to prove valuable at implementation stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>many development partners operate in the region and most include aspects of the maritime sector in their areas of support. Major development partners in the region include the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), EU, UN, World Bank as well as national agencies such as USAID (USA), GIZ (Germany), JICA (Japan) and the UK (FCDO, CME, CIF)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grenada has gained access to climate and sustainable development finance from a range of international funding sources. The following funds are particularly relevant to the implementation of this Maritime Economy Plan - Adaptation Fund; Global Environment Facility; Green Climate Fund, Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), Clean Technology Fund (CTF)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grenada, like many Caribbean countries, operates a CBI programme, which is used to support national economic growth. This could be targeted towards blue maritime sector development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a blue bond is a debt instrument issued by governments, development banks or others to raise capital to finance marine- and ocean-based projects that have positive environmental, economic and climate benefit. Other SIDS are already exploring the potential of blue bond creation and revenue as part of their maritime economy support mechanisms e.g. Seychelles, Fiji</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that the following suggested Implementation Pathway Activities will benefit from coordinated proposals for development assistance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a formally established Grenada National Ocean Governance Committee (NOGC) and with resources and remit to develop and implement the Grenada NOP, integrating specific MEP recommendations and actions, to deliver integrated marine spatial planning with sustainable blue economic growth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>port and shipping Master plan with a phased upgrade and development of small, medium and large infrastructure to take account of tourism / visitor development growth and the required support services. This should include necessary waste and waste-water infrastructure to ensure water quality is maintained and improved. This must be backed up with resources to monitor and enforce standards e.g. water quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>update and implementation of environmental regulation for EIA and integration into planning / development process and a training and development programme / scheme to ensure it has cross-departmental understanding, uptake and enforcement to deliver strategic development outcomes as well as inform individual planning decisions. This has benefits across several sectors – coastal development, tourism, ports / shipping – as EIA, climate resilient design, building codes and enforcement of the same is needed for all developments. Resources, awareness raising and training is needed for specific staff and across government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>update the National Physical Development Plan, taking account of a ridge to reef (Islands Systems Management) approach and linked to the NOP, Marine Spatial Plans, Coastal Master Plans and development needs projections (housing, tourism growth, port masterplan, etc.). Link to new EIA regulations and implementation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>undertake a natural capital valuation to understand the value of ecosystem goods and services and underpin / integrate into decision making and planning</p>
  </li>
</ul>
