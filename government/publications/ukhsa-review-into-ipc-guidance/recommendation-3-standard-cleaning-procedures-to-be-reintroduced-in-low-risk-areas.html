<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Enhanced and more frequent cleaning of surfaces was considered to be an important mitigation to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Providers of health and social care were advised that the frequency of cleaning of both the environment and equipment in patient areas, including frequently touched sites/points and shared communal facilities, should be increased.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>Enhanced cleaning procedures can be stepped down to pre-COVID-19 levels in agreed low risk areas and providers can revert to standard cleaning procedures including those required between patients. This is because the risk of infection being transmitted from surfaces (fomites) is believed to be low where there are no individuals with symptoms of COVID-19.  These decisions will be informed by local risk assessments which should include the hierarchy of controls.</p>

<p>This recommendation does not change the underlying need to observe a stringent cleaning regime and adhere to current infection prevention and control policies. All healthcare workers need to continuously update their knowledge on the importance of maintaining a clean and safe care environment for patients as for routine care. Every healthcare worker needs to know their specific responsibilities for cleaning and decontaminating the clinical environment and the equipment used in patient care. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the NHSE National Standards of Healthcare Cleanliness (2021) emphasise the importance of effective cleaning in relation to infection prevention and control</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-health-and-social-care-act-2008-code-of-practice-on-the-prevention-and-control-of-infections-and-related-guidance" class="govuk-link">the Code of Practice on the prevention and control of infection and related guidance</a> (2015) expects providers of regulated activities to provide and maintain a clean and appropriate environment in managed premises that facilitates the prevention and control of infections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evidence</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-2021.1">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> and other international authorities have recently stated that there is currently limited evidence on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via surfaces. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emg-spi-m-and-spi-b-considerations-in-implementing-long-term-baseline-npis-22-april-2021">The Independent Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B)</a> has advised that hand hygiene is likely to be more effective than enhanced cleaning for reducing transmission via contaminated surfaces and that this has benefits for preventing other disease transmission and reduces healthcare burdens.</p>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency has consulted a range of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> specialists on reducing enhanced cleaning in low risk areas and they are supportive of the amended advice which will enable the NHS to increase patient throughput.</p>
