<h2>Who is likely to be affected</h2>

<p>Employed and self-employed people who have a National Insurance Contributions (<abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>) liability.</p>

<h2>General description of the measure</h2>

<p>This measure will increase the Primary Threshold (<abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>) for Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> and Lower Profits Limit (<abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr>) for Class 4 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> from 6 July 2022, aligning them with the personal allowance for income tax which is set at £12,570 per annum. These thresholds will remain aligned.</p>

<p>From April 2022, this measure also reduces Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> liabilities to nil on profits between the Small Profits Threshold (<abbr title="Small Profits Threshold">SPT</abbr>) and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr>. This will ensure that no one earning between the <abbr title="Small Profits Threshold">SPT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> will pay any Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, while allowing individuals to be able to continue to build up National Insurance credits.</p>

<h2>Background to the measure</h2>

<p>The Government has an ultimate ambition to align the <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> starting thresholds with the income tax personal allowance. For the 2020-21 tax year the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> were raised by over £800 to £9,500, representing a tax cut for 31 million workers. For 2021-22, the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> were increased by CPI to £9,568. The current legislated position for 2022-23 is a further increase by CPI to £9,880 from April.</p>

<p>At Spring Statement 2022 the government has announced that it will meet this ambition by aligning the starting thresholds from July 2022 and, alongside this, from April 2022, self-employed individuals with profits between the <abbr title="Small Profits Threshold">SPT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> will continue to be able to build up National Insurance credits but will not pay any Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Detailed proposal</h2>

<h3>Operative date</h3>

<p>In the case of the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>, it is intended that the measure will have effect from 6 July 2022. In the case of the <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr>, because self-employed <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are calculated on an annual basis, the measure will apply from the start of the 2022-23 tax year, but with an annualised threshold, so the effect is equivalent across the tax year to those who are employed and paid on a weekly or monthly basis. This means the <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> will be £11,908 for the 2022-23 tax year which is equivalent to 13 weeks of the threshold at £9,880 and 39 weeks at £12,570, reflecting the position for employees <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Changes to Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will start from the beginning of the 2022-23 tax year, reflecting the annualised basis of the thresholds underpinning Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Current law</h3>

<p>The weekly <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> can be set for a tax year using powers in section 5(1) Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (SSCBA) and its Northern Ireland equivalent. The monthly and yearly equivalents of the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> are set out in regulation 11(3)(a) and (3)(b) of the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 (SSCR). The annual <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> can be set for each tax year by using powers in section 141(4) Social Security Administration Act 1992 (SSAA) and its Northern Ireland equivalent.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> are currently set at £9,880 for the tax year 2022-23.</p>

<p>Existing Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> thresholds can be set by using powers in section 141(4) SSAA and its Northern Ireland equivalent. Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> are set at a flat rate of £3.15 per week in 2022-23.</p>

<h3>Proposed revisions</h3>

<p>Primary legislation will be introduced in due course that amends section 15(3), 18(1) and (1A) SSCBA and its Northern Ireland equivalent, and regulations 8, 10, 11 and 21 of the SSCR to set the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> at the equivalent of £12,570 per annum from 6 July 2022 to align with the income tax personal allowance.</p>

<p>The legislation will also provide a power for HM Treasury to lay regulations to ensure that the threshold for paying Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> is equivalent to the <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr>, but that the regulations may treat individuals whose profits are between the <abbr title="Small Profits Threshold">SPT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> as having made Class 2 contributions.</p>

<p>These figures are set out in Table 3.1 of Spring Statement 2022.</p>

<p>The costing for the increase in the annual <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr> and <abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> was certified by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The costing for Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will be certified at the next fiscal event.</p>

<p>More details can be found in the policy costings document published alongside Spring Statement 2022.</p>

<h4>Economic impact</h4>

<p>The OBR have incorporated the impact of the <abbr title="Primary Threshold">PT</abbr>/<abbr title="Lower Profits Limit">LPL</abbr> measure in their economy forecast to account for the temporary impact on consumption from this measure. More details can be found in their March 2022 Economic and Fiscal Outlook.</p>

<p>The measure is anticipated to have a positive impact on earnings.  It will also act to support labour supply by increasing the return to work, particularly for low earners.  These effects on their own are not expected to generate a significant macroeconomic impact in the long-run.</p>

<p>Small adjustments are made to take account of behavioural responses, including individuals increasing their taxable income in response to the threshold increase and changes to future incorporations.</p>

<p>The terms used in this section are defined in line with the OBR’s indirect effects process. This will apply where, for example, a measure affects inflation or growth.</p>

<h4>Impact on individuals, households and families</h4>

<p>This measure will have a positive impact on individuals, households and families across the United Kingdom by increasing the point at which employees and the self-employed start paying <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>. Almost 30 million individuals will benefit from this measure. From July, around 70% of <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> payers will pay less <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr>, even after accounting for the introduction of the Health and Social Care Levy.</p>

<p>The change to Class 2 <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> will provide a tax cut for around 500,000 self-employed people worth up to £165 per year. Actual gains for individuals will vary according to their circumstances.</p>

<p>There is expected to be no impact on family formation, stability or breakdown.</p>

<h4>Equalities impacts</h4>

<p>It is not expected that there will be disproportionate impacts on groups sharing protected characteristics.</p>

<h4>Impact on business including civil society organisations</h4>

<p>This measure is expected to have an impact on over 1.6 million employers who will be required to introduce this change in their payroll software. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the change and will also include updating payroll software or systems to reflect the change. 
Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not significantly alter how employers interact with <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>. This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations.</p>

<h4>Operational impact (£m) (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> or other)</h4>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> anticipates some increases in call volumes from customers as a result of implementing this change. The initial assessment does not suggest there will be significant delivery costs in implementing this policy. <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will continue to undertake and refine its operational impacting. It is anticipated that further IT changes may be identified and required to be delivered at additional cost to <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, to support safe delivery of this policy.</p>

<h4>Other impacts</h4>

<p>No other impacts have been identified.</p>

<h2>Monitoring and evaluation</h2>

<p>The measure will be kept under review and monitored through information collected from <abbr title="National Insurance contributions">NICs</abbr> receipts.</p>

<h2>Further advice</h2>

<h2>Declaration</h2>
