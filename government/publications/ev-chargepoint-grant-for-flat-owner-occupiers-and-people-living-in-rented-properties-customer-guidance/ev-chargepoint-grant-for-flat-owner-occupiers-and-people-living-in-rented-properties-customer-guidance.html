<h2>About the scheme</h2>

<p>This scheme replaces the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme (<abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>) and is open to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>homeowners who live in flats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people in rental accommodation (flats and single-use properties)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This is an interim manual service that will be in place until a digital service for this scheme goes live (expected summer 2022).</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance remains largely unchanged from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customer-guidance-electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme">Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme: guidance for customers</a>.</p>

<p>The main changes are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer must live in rental accommodation or own a flat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the installer must confirm ownership of the property. If rented, confirm the name and address of person or entity letting the property as it appears on the rental agreement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>customers will no longer be able to claim for 2 chargepoints if they own a second electric vehicle</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> authorised installers will be eligible to claim under this scheme. The installer applies for the grant on behalf of the customer.</p>

<p>The same list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> approved chargepoints</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-eligible-vehicles"><abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> eligible vehicles</a> applies to this scheme.</p>

<p>Once the digital service goes live, the Office for Zero Emissions (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) will transfer grant applicants over to the digital portal to prevent duplicate applications.</p>

<p>Electric vehicles are a crucial step to decarbonising our transport system and reducing air pollution through zero tailpipe emissions. The government recognises that many people will want to charge their electric vehicles at home. This grant scheme is designed to help them do so.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant provides a 75% contribution to the cost of one chargepoint and its installation.</p>

<p>A grant cap is set at £350 (including <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) per installation.</p>

<p>The main requirement is that a person owns, leases or has ordered a qualifying vehicle and has dedicated off-street parking at their property.</p>

<p>They also must live in rental accommodation or own a flat.</p>

<p>The grant works by a customer choosing an <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> installer to install their chargepoint.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> installer checks that they qualify and then applies on the customer’s behalf.</p>

<p>The installer will bill the customer for the price of the installation, less the grant amount they have applied for.</p>

<p>If the application is successful, the installer will be paid the grant amount that they have offset from the customer’s bill.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> aims to process claims for experienced installers within 30 working days.</p>

<p>The government reserves the right to terminate the grant at any time but will aim to provide 4 weeks’ notice.</p>

<p>Should the grant rate change, or the scheme end, the government will honour grant claims made before the date of any public announcement subject to meeting all relevant criteria set out in this guidance. The announcement will detail how claims made after it will be treated.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<h4>Chargepoint manufacturer</h4>

<p>A party that manufactures chargepoints that have been approved under the <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Authorised installer</h4>

<p>A party that has been authorised by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to install electric vehicle chargepoints and apply for the grant on behalf of their customers.</p>

<p>The term ‘installer’ in this document means ‘authorised installer’.</p>

<h4>Authorised installer representative</h4>

<p>A party that has been authorised by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> to sub-contract to installers the installation of chargepoints.</p>

<h4>Customer</h4>

<p>A party who wishes to have a chargepoint installed at their place of residence.</p>

<h2>Grant eligibility</h2>

<h3>Customer requirements</h3>

<p>A customer will qualify if they have a qualifying vehicle and property as detailed below.</p>

<p>A customer is not permitted to claim for a grant if they have previously claimed against the scheme (or its predecessors, the <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>) and the Domestic Recharge Scheme unless they own 2 eligible electric vehicles concurrently in which case a second chargepoint grant can be claimed. This includes if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move property</li>
  <li>purchase a new chargepoint, even if it is for a new car that is not compatible with the old one</li>
  <li>update an old chargepoint to a new one</li>
  <li>want to claim against the cost of moving an existing chargepoint to a new property</li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer is moving to a new house with an old chargepoint and they wish to replace it, they would be eligible for the grant (providing that customer has not previously claimed against the scheme and all other requirements are met).</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> cannot provide bespoke advice on eligibility. Customers should consult with an approved <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> installer regarding their individual circumstances and if they qualify.</p>

<p>If you live in Scotland, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/grants-and-loans/domestic-charge-point-funding/" rel="external">additional funding may be available from the Scottish Government via the Energy Saving Trust</a>.</p>

<h3>Vehicle ownership requirements</h3>

<h4>Vehicle requirements</h4>

<p>The following customers are eligible to access the grant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>individuals who become registered keepers of a new or second-hand eligible electric vehicle – note that the registered keeper is not necessarily the owner of a vehicle, but the person responsible for the car that pays for road tax and MOT</li>
  <li>individuals who are assigned a company car for at least 6 months</li>
  <li>individuals who lease an eligible vehicle for at least 6 months</li>
  <li>individuals who lease an eligible electric vehicle through a salary sacrifice scheme</li>
  <li>individuals who are named, by their employer, as the primary user of an eligible electric vehicle for at least 6 months</li>
  <li>individuals who have ordered an eligible electric vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, the customer must be able to provide evidence that they qualify under one of the above categories. The evidence required is described under <a class="govuk-link" href="#documents-required">documents required</a>.</p>

<h3>Vehicle leases</h3>

<p>For short-term leases that roll month on month, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>) will accept a claim once a person has had the lease for at least 6 months and can evidence this.</p>

<p>If a chargepoint is bundled in with a vehicle lease, the following requirements must be met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the customer must have a qualifying vehicle</li>
  <li>the installation must take place at the customer’s place of residence (which must have off-street parking as per our <a class="govuk-link" href="#parking">dedicated off-street parking</a> requirements)</li>
  <li>the lease agreement must clearly:
    <ul>
      <li>state the customer will be the owner of the chargepoint once payment is complete</li>
      <li>itemise the cost to the customer of the chargepoint and its installation (including any applicable <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) – this is the amount that a grant may be offset against</li>
      <li>ensure the warranty for the chargepoint meets the <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> requirements</li>
      <li>ensure any associated vehicle lease is for at least 6 months</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a copy of the lease agreement must be submitted to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> with the application so that the above can be verified</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eligible vehicles</h3>

<p>To be eligible for the grant, the vehicle must be listed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-eligible-vehicles"><abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> eligible vehicles list</a> at the time of installation. The list includes battery-powered and plug-in electric cars, vans, taxis and motorcycles.</p>

<p>If a vehicle or model is not listed, it is not eligible for grant.</p>

<p>Vehicles are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If your vehicle is not present, contact the manufacturer of the vehicle to confirm why it is not listed.</p>

<h3>Property requirements</h3>

<p>This grant is for domestic properties only (for workplaces, refer to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles#workplace-charging-scheme">Workplace Charging Scheme</a>).</p>

<p>The grant is only for retrofit (existing) properties; it cannot be used for new-builds or properties that are not occupied.</p>

<p>The customer must be resident at the property. This will be checked via vehicle registration details. Where the link between the customer and the property is unclear, additional supporting evidence may be required (for example, a utility bill).</p>

<p>Any necessary third-party permissions (such as from a freeholder or managing agent of a block of flats) must be obtained by the customer before an installation occurs. This will be needed for rented or leasehold properties where it’s the renter or the leaseholder applying.</p>

<p>Where an installation requires cabling or other parts of the installation to be placed in or on another person’s property, or public land, access rights and permissions must be agreed by all parties using legally binding arrangements, such as legal covenants, before an installation begins.</p>

<p>There is no requirement to inform <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> if you are moving a chargepoint to a new house or if you move house.</p>

<h3>Dedicated off-street parking</h3>

<p>The customer’s property must have designated, private off-street parking. This may be co-located with the property or separate from it. Where the parking is separate, the customer must be able to demonstrate that they have a legal entitlement to the parking space through the provision of land registry title deeds.</p>

<p>The parking must be suitable for a chargepoint installation (a survey before installation must be conducted by the installer). The parking must be able to permit an eligible vehicle to be charged safely. The customer must be able to access the parking space at all times.</p>

<p>We are not able to permit arrangements that involve cables being placed over public land, such as pavements, even if it is temporary.</p>

<p>Installers are expected to determine if the parking will permit an eligible vehicle to be charged safely. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will not intervene in any negative assessment made by an installer.</p>

<h3>Installation requirements</h3>

<p>Chargepoint installations must be carried out in accordance with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BS EN 61851-1:2019</li>
  <li>the current edition of the IET Wiring Regulations – currently BS 7671:2018+A1:2020</li>
  <li>the recommendations of the IET Code of Practice for Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installations (as amended)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>The installation should consider the requirements of BS 8300:2009+A1:2010 and the requirements of disabled people.</p>

<p>The final installation shall be in accordance with the current edition of the Building Regulations Part P (Electrical Safety – Dwellings).</p>

<p>Equipment installed shall meet the applicable minimum IP ratings set out in BS EN 61851-1:2019 and BS 7671:2018 according to the usage location.</p>

<p>The electrical supply of the final installation should allow the charging equipment to operate at full rated capacity. Where local supply constraints prevent operation at full rated capacity, the charging equipment shall be classified according to actual output capacity.</p>

<p>Chargepoint installers must notify the relevant <abbr title="Distribution Network Operator">DNO</abbr> directly of the installation of a chargepoint. Full guidance for the <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> connection process can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/connecting-to-the-networks" rel="external">Energy Networks Association (ENA) website</a>. This is to minimise the chance of power quality issues to electricity customers.</p>

<h3>Installer requirements</h3>

<p>The grant can only be claimed by <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>-approved installers (on behalf of their customers) who are accredited by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.electricalcompetentperson.co.uk" rel="external">Competent Person Scheme</a> at the time of installation. Details of authorised installers may be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-authorised-installers"><abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> authorised installers list</a>.</p>

<h3>Equipment requirements</h3>

<p>All chargepoints must be on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-approved-chargepoint-model-list"><abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> approved chargepoint model list</a> at the time of installation.</p>

<p>It is important to ensure that the chargepoint model name is exactly the same as one stated on the eligible list. Claims will be rejected if the model claimed is not on the list.</p>

<p>If a model is not listed, it is not eligible for grant.</p>

<p>The chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If your chargepoint is not present, contact the chargepoint manufacturer to confirm why it is not listed.</p>

<p>A customer may provide their own chargepoint if it’s on the approved chargepoint model list and they can provide a manufacturer’s 3-year on-site warranty. However, such equipment will not be eligible for a grant. The installer may only claim for the cost of labour and other parts provided for the installation.</p>

<p>For details on what is covered by an approval, contact the chargepoint manufacturer.</p>

<h2>How to claim</h2>

<h3>Overview of process</h3>

<p>A customer needs to ask an <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>-approved installer to apply for the grant on their behalf. Customers cannot apply directly for an <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> grant. Installers are required to process claims as this ensures that the requirements of the scheme are fulfilled and minimises the risk of incorrectly completed claim forms.</p>

<p>The installer will need to verify that the customer meets the requirements and that the property is also suitable. In some instances, customers will need to contact their distribution network operator (<abbr title="Distribution Network Operator">DNO</abbr>) to upgrade their property’s electricity supply before work can commence. Installers will inform the customer if this is the case.</p>

<p>Once work is completed the installer will offset the grant amount against the cost of the installation and apply for a grant rebate from <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. The customer will be invoiced for the cost of the installation less the grant amount the installer intends to claim.</p>

<p>The customer is expected to help the installer complete the installation form by verifying the information provided is correct and providing any necessary documentation or information that the installer requires.</p>

<h3>Customer responsibilities</h3>

<p>The customer must ensure they meet the qualifying criteria and sign the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-customer-guidance"><abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant installation form</a> confirming this.</p>

<p>By signing parts A and B of the form, the customer is declaring that the details of the installation and any evidence submitted as part of the application were valid on the day of installation.</p>

<p>If the customer will not be available on the day of installation, they may nominate a third party to take responsibility for signing part B of the form. They should inform their installer of this before installation takes place. The customer will still need to sign part A. This may be signed prior to installation</p>

<p>It’s the customer’s responsibility to inform the installer if their circumstances change prior to the day of installation, as this may result in the application becoming ineligible for funding.</p>

<p>If the customer fails to inform the installer of any such change, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary to claim the funding back from the customer.</p>

<h3>Help with wider responsibilities of property owners and managers</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a> requires property managers and owners to assess potential fire risks and put in place adequate and proportionate fire protection measures to mitigate against the risk to life from fire and then maintain them. This should be updated when installing <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints.</p>

<p>The government will produce guidance to aid this assessment for electric vehicle fires, available in early 2022. This will identify mitigations and measures that can be taken when installing electric vehicle chargepoints in enclosed car parks. As such it will help building owners meet their existing duties under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p>

<h3>How to choose an installer </h3>

<p>View a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-authorised-installers">list of <abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> authorised chargepoint installers</a>.</p>

<h3>How to make a claim </h3>

<p>The customer’s chosen installer will claim on behalf of the customer.</p>

<p>To enable a claim to be made the customer must complete a customer declaration on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-customer-guidance"><abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant installation form</a>. The customer must confirm that the details provided are correct.</p>

<p>The form requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the customer’s personal details</li>
  <li>evidence of an eligible electric vehicle</li>
  <li>a declaration by the customer that they and their property meet the requirements of the scheme</li>
  <li>the details of the chargepoint</li>
  <li>the costs of the installation</li>
  <li>consent from the customer for the installer to claim on their behalf</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rectification of installation</h3>

<p>Charging equipment must be supplied with an on-site 3-year warranty on parts and installation. Should the customer encounter any issues within the warranty period, they should contact their chargepoint installer or manufacturer to request rectification of the problem. If a company fails to comply with the warranty requirements of the scheme, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Chargepoint.Grants@ozev.gov.uk">Chargepoint.Grants@ozev.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Electric Vehicles Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr> complaints</h3>

<p>Any customer complaints should be directed to <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Chargepoint.Grants@ozev.gov.uk">Chargepoint.Grants@ozev.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>How installers apply for the grant</h2>

<h3>Overview of process</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;administers the <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant for people renting and living in flats on behalf of&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. Installers should submit grant claims (form and supporting documents) to&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/olev-installation-grant/" rel="external">through the&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;installation grant portal</a>.</p>

<p>The following steps illustrate the processes relating to the scheme from the perspective of an installer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take an enquiry from a customer.</li>
  <li>Verify that a customer is a flat-owner, or rents a property (house or flat), and has an electric vehicle.</li>
  <li>Conduct a site survey to ensure that the existing equipment and property are suitable for an installation.</li>
  <li>Install the chargepoint, turn it on, and verify it works safely.</li>
  <li>Complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-customer-guidance">the <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant installation form</a> with the customer – the customer will be required to verify that the information provided is correct and will need to sign it.</li>
  <li>Notify the relevant distribution network operator (<abbr title="Distribution Network Operator">DNO</abbr>) and submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate.</li>
  <li>Invoice the customer (less any deposit paid) – note that the customer should not be invoiced for the grant amount.</li>
  <li>Compile and submit a monthly grant claim form and supporting documents – send the claim form to&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;by the last working day of the month following installation.</li>
  <li>Receive a grant from&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;or respond to claim feedback from&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Retain copies of all customer details and required documents.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<h4>Installer responsibilities</h4>

<p>Only <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> authorised installers can claim the grant on behalf of the domestic customer.</p>

<p>Installers must not charge customers for the grant in advance of payment being made by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Installers must ensure that the customer meets the qualifying criteria before performing an installation.</p>

<p>For each installed domestic chargepoint the installer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm ownership of the property. If rented, confirm the name and address of person or entity letting the property as it appears on the rental agreement</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoint is approved</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoint is tested to verify it’s fully functioning and meets safety requirements</li>
  <li>ensure the same chargepoint is not claimed for twice</li>

A third party nominated by the customer may take responsibility for signing part B on the day of installation, therefore confirming the unique chargepoint serial number, the amount charged and that the installation has been completed.</p>

<p>The installer must ensure that they have 2 signatures and that there are no gaps. If not, the claim will be rejected.</p>

<h4>Chargepoint audits</h4>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, will conduct on-site audits of installed chargepoints to ensure the requirements of the grant are met. If a chargepoint is selected for audit <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, will contact the relevant party for further information. Information requested may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates (including the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate and Building Regulations compliance certificate), including customer signatures, dates of installation and full address</li>
  <li>photographs taken at the time of installation demonstrating that the existing supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will seek to provide feedback to installers on any of their installations audited.</p>

<h3>Documents required</h3>

<p>The installer must ensure that part A and part B of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-customer-guidance"><abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant installation form</a> is signed and dated by the customer and part C is signed and dated by the installer. All parts of the form must be completed. Incomplete or other installation forms will not be accepted (unless submitting 2 versions of the form).</p>

<p>Please note that <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> is unable to provide a proofing service to verify if you have completed the form correctly.</p>

<p>For each installation, the installer must provide a completed <abbr title="Electric Vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint grant:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-installer-guidance">installation form</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-chargepoint-grant-for-flat-owner-occupiers-and-people-living-in-rented-properties-installer-guidance">grant claim form</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following documentation will also be required:</p>

<h4>1. Photographic evidence of the chargepoint installation</h4>

<p>This should comprise one photograph that clearly shows the property, the off-street parking and the installed chargepoint. The photograph should be attached with the application.</p>

<p>If the property and the off-street parking cannot be clearly displayed in one photograph, you will either need to provide multiple photographs or provide a photograph showing the off-street parking and the installed chargepoint and a title deed which demonstrate that the parking is linked to the property.</p>

<h4>2. A copy of the <abbr title="Distribution Network Operator">DNO</abbr> notification email or monthly spreadsheet listing installations</h4>

<p>The form can be downloaded by installers from the ENA website. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/Single-Electric-Vehicle-Charge-Point-and-Heat-Pump-Installation-Application-Form.doc" rel="external">single notification form</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/industry-hub/resource-library/low-carbon-technologies-multi-install-application-form.xlsx" rel="external">multi-notification spreadsheet</a> that must be submitted <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/connecting-to-the-networks" rel="external">directly to the network operator</a>.</p>

<p>This must be supplied from 1 April 2021. If it is not, your claim will be rejected.</p>

<h4>3. A copy of the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</h4>

<p>This must be supplied from 1 April 2021. If it is not, your claim will be rejected.</p>

<h4>4. Evidence that the customer has a qualifying electric vehicle</h4>

<p>Installers must ensure that at least one piece of evidence is provided to demonstrate that a customer has a qualifying vehicle. Failure to provide evidence will result in an invalid application.</p>

<p>Where the customer has possession of an electric vehicle, the vehicle registration number (<abbr title="Vehicle Registration Number">VRN</abbr>) must be provided in all grant claims and will be considered as evidence. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will validate these details internally.</p>

<p>For applications where a <abbr title="Vehicle Registration Number">VRN</abbr> is not available, evidence that an order has been placed for a vehicle must be provided (for example, an email from manufacturer or an order form.</p>

<p>If the installer cannot provide the evidence above, the grant claim will not be paid.</p>

<h4>Process when a customer uses a vehicle from an employer</h4>

<p>Where a customer has been named by their employer as the primary user of an eligible electric vehicle, the installer must submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="#employer-template">letter from the employer using the template below</a> as part of the grant claim.</p>

<p>If an employer’s vehicle fleet management is outsourced, the letter template can be filled out and signed by an official from the company managing the fleet. The employer must give written permission (via email or letter) for an official with fleet management responsibility from the fleet company to sign on their behalf. This permission must be retained by both companies as <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> may request this as evidence for future audits. It does not have to be attached to the application.</p>

<p>If the vehicle has not yet been delivered and the <abbr title="Vehicle Registration Number">VRN</abbr> is unknown, the make and model of the vehicle must be entered on the template. If that is not known, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will be unable to process the claim as we will not be able to confirm if the vehicle is eligible.</p>

<p>The text below should be included on company headed paper and signed by a senior member of the company. If company headed paper is not available, the installer must ensure the employer’s address details are included in the letter.</p>

<p>For company cars, the installer must provide 1 of 3 pieces of evidence requested in the boxes below in support of this letter. The evidence required is one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the employer’s/business’s registration number – this can be found on a company’s certificate of incorporation or any official company documentation received from Companies House</li>
  <li>the employer’s/business’s <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> number</li>
  <li>evidence of the employer’s/business’s <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration which must be provided as an attachment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many sole traders and small companies are neither registered with Companies House nor <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered. In this instance, provide evidence that this company has registered with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> (such as a confirmation letter or email from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>
