<p>The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care of 39 Victoria Street, Westminster, London, SW1H 0EU, United Kingdom (“DHSC”) and social care providers in the United Kingdom are seeking to collaborate to combat the SARS-CoV2-19 (“COVID-19”) pandemic.</p>

<p>In these terms and conditions (the “T&amp;Cs”), “Provider” means the independent healthcare provider to which the T&amp;Cs have been provided or made available to.</p>

<p>DHSC and the Provider have agreed that DHSC will support the Provider to carry out and facilitate COVID-19 testing of the Provider’s staff who come into contact with NHS patients within the Provider’s setting (“Test Subjects”).</p>

<p>The key objective of the Testing (as defined below) is to ensure the ongoing safety of the Provider’s setting. The Testing has the additional objective of seeking to ascertain how access to testing can support Test Subjects’ wellbeing alongside wider infection, prevention, and control measures, and feed into a holistic risk-based approach.</p>

<p>Commencement of the Testing (including the ordering of DHSC Supplies) by the Provider is deemed as acceptance of the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>For the purpose of Decision 2012/21/EU of the European Commission of 20 December 2011, the T&amp;Cs entrusts the Provider with the performance of public service obligations, which are set out in the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>DHSC and the Provider have agreed to proceed with the Testing upon and subject to the following terms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Term</h3>

<p>1.1 The agreement between the parties under the T&amp;Cs will begin on commencement of the supply by DHSC of DHSC Supplies (as defined below) and/or Testing under the T&amp;Cs (whichever is earlier) (“Commencement Date”).</p>

<p>1.2 The agreement shall continue from the Commencement Date for as long as the Provider continues to carry out the Testing (“Term”), at which point the agreement shall expire unless any extension is agreed in writing between the parties.</p>

<p>1.3 Any work such as training or preparation for the Testing by the parties prior to the Commencement Date shall be treated as having been performed under the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Standard operating procedure</h3>

<p>2.1 DHSC has made available to the Provider a COVID-19 testing guidance document applicable to the Provider (“Guidance”), which sets out a detailed description and plan of the testing and ancillary responsibilities that are to be carried out by the Provider under the T&amp;Cs. The definition of “Guidance” shall include each of the documents and webpages which are linked to in the Guidance.</p>

<p>2.2 The Self-Test Kits are supplied with instructions for use (the latest version being the “Instructions for Use”) which the Provider must provide to Test Subjects where such kits are collected pursuant to these T&amp;Cs. DHSC may from time to time update the Instructions for Use.</p>

<p>2.3 Where Self-Test Kits are supplied with two sets of instructions for use, one from the original manufacturer and a second from DHSC, the “Instructions for Use” for such Self-Test Kits shall be the DHSC instructions for use and the original manufacturer’s instructions for use must not be provided to a Test Subject.</p>

<p>2.4 The Provider agrees to operate a collection site to enable Test Subjects to collect Self-Test Kits from the Provider for COVID-19 testing in accordance with the Guidance (the “Testing”).</p>

<p>2.5 DHSC may update the Guidance during the Term from time to time and following such update will provide or make available a copy of the updated Guidance to the Provider. Unless otherwise agreed with DHSC in writing, any updated Guidance and/or Instructions for Use shall apply from the date on which it is provided to the Provider.</p>

<p>2.6 If DHSC makes a change to the Guidance which would have a material adverse impact on the Provider, the Provider may request that DHSC makes further changes to the Guidance to avoid or mitigate that impact. If DHSC does not make such further changes to the Guidance within 7 days, either party may immediately on written notice terminate the agreement.</p>

<p>2.7 In the event of conflict between the Guidance and the terms of the T&amp;Cs, the terms of the T&amp;Cs shall prevail.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Testing</h3>

<p>3.1 Each Party agrees to perform the obligations that are allocated to it in the Guidance in accordance with the Guidance, the T&amp;Cs and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>3.2 In addition to clause 3.1, the Provider shall:</p>

<h4>Communication and set-up</h4>

<p>3.2.1 liaise with the appointed representative(s) of any stakeholders at or connected to the Provider in connection with the Testing;</p>

<p>3.2.2 cooperate with DHSC in liaising with the applicable local authority bodies as required in connection with the Testing;</p>

<p>3.2.3 undertake and deliver all communications in accordance with DHSC guidance, including the communication of the Testing to potential Test Subjects; and</p>

<h4>Procurement of personnel</h4>

<p>3.2.5 provide, procure or otherwise arrange for the supply of suitably competent personnel to perform each of the roles set out in the Guidance designated to be provided by the Provider and to ensure that such personnel perform in accordance with the Guidance;</p>

<p>3.2.6 ensure that personnel who are to be involved in the Testing shall attend all training as required by the Guidance or by DHSC in advance of being involved in the Testing, and shall perform their role in relation to the Testing in accordance with any such training;</p>

<p>3.2.7 on request, provide DHSC with appropriate evidence that each person has completed the training in clause 3.2.6;</p>

<h4>Procurement of materials</h4>

<p>3.2.8 provide such items as are necessary to carry out the Testing, except for any items which are to be provided by DHSC as listed in the Guidance;</p>

<p>3.2.9 inspect the DHSC Supplies in accordance after delivery in accordance with clause 5.4.2;</p>

<p>3.2.11 not do anything to modify, obscure or contradict the Instructions for Use; and</p>

<p>3.2.12 in the event of any product recall in relation to NHS Branded Kits, provide any assistance reasonably requested by DHSC in identifying the location of the impacted NHS Branded Kits, returning or, at DHSC’s request, destroying impacted NHS Branded Kits, and/or contacting or otherwise communicating to the affected Test Subject(s) in accordance with DHSC’s instructions;</p>

<h4>Carrying out of the testing</h4>

<p>3.2.13 be responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from Test Subjects in connection with the Testing;</p>

<p>3.2.15 ensure that any waiting or queuing is done in a COVID-19 secure manner in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations;</p>

<p>3.2.16 distribute the Self-Test Kits with the Instructions for Use and any applicable self-test guidance document(s) to Test Subjects for the purpose of the Testing pursuant to these T&amp;Cs and not make any other use of the Self-Test Kits. The Provider shall use its reasonable endeavours to distribute the NHS Branded Kits with the Instructions for Use in accordance with any timeframes set out in the Guidance;</p>

<p>3.2.17 provide the Provider’s unique organisation number to Test Subjects prior to or at the time that Test Subjects collect Self-Test Kits;</p>

<p>3.2.18 perform its obligations with all reasonable skill and care and in accordance with the Guidance and applicable regulations;</p>

<p>3.2.20 at DHSC’s request, cooperate in an independent or internal quality assurance programme;</p>

<p>3.2.21 separately from any business as usual waste, safely dispose of any waste, including samples, testing kits, kit peripherals and PPE, and any waste suspected of being contaminated with Covid- 19, in accordance with the Guidance;</p>

<p>3.2.22 report any material problems or incidents with the DHSC Supplies to DHSC as soon as reasonably practicable in accordance with any processes agreed by the parties from time to time, save that any serious incident shall be reported as soon as possible to DHSC (in any event within 24 hours of the incident); and</p>

<p>3.2.23 provide such aggregated and anonymised data relating to Test Subjects as the parties may agree from time to time.</p>

<p>3.3 For the avoidance of doubt, the Provider has the right to deny a potential Test Subject who is displaying symptoms of Covid- 19 from participating in the Testing and shall instead direct the individual to the appropriate symptomatic guidelines and practices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Test kit log</h3>

<p>4.1 The Provider shall establish and maintain a test kit log in accordance with the Guidance and requirements of these T&amp;Cs (“Test Kit Log”) (which may be comprised of a number of locally held documents where applicable).</p>

<p>4.2 Promptly after the Provider provides each NHS Branded Kit and Instructions for Use to a Test Subject, the Provider shall update the Test Kit Log to confirm:</p>

<p>4.2.1 the first name, last name, and telephone number and/or email address of the Test Subject;</p>

<p>4.2.2 that the Instructions for Use were provided to the relevant Test Subject with the NHS Branded Kits;</p>

<p>4.3 On written request by DHSC, the Provider shall:</p>

<p>4.3.1 make available to DHSC the data from its Test Kit Log (in a format as notified by DHSC) by uploading the data in accordance with any time lines and process as notified by DHSC; and</p>

<p>4.3.2 submit a copy of its Test Kit Log to DHSC (in the format as notified by DHSC).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> DHSC responsibilities</h3>

<p>5.1 In addition to clause 3.1, DHSC shall:</p>

<p>5.1.1 cooperate with the Provider in liaising with the applicable local authority bodies as required in connection with the Testing;</p>

<p>5.1.2 provide access to an online training and assessment tool for use by the individuals selected by the Provider to carry out Testing;</p>

<p>5.1.3 provide a reasonable level of advice and support to the Provider on matters relating to the Testing; and</p>

<p>5.1.4 provide such items as are listed as to be provided by DHSC in the Guidance and in such quantities as are agreed between the parties, including LFD antigen testing kits (as set out in clause 5.2), (collectively, “DHSC Supplies”).</p>

<p>5.2 DHSC may provide the following types of LFD antigen testing kits under these T&amp;Cs:</p>

<p>5.2.1 NHS branded LFD antigen testing kits supplied for use in Self- Test Collect (“NHS Branded Kits”); and/or</p>

<p>5.3 DHSC shall be responsible for ensuring that:</p>

<p>5.3.1 save where the Guidance expressly states otherwise, the Guidance is appropriate for the Testing in accordance with the T&amp;Cs and applicable law and regulation (provided that the Provider acknowledges that the implementation of the Guidance by the Provider needs to take account of the particular circumstances of the Provider and accordingly the Guidance cannot include a comprehensive list of all actions that will be required to carry out the Testing at the Provider);</p>

<p>5.3.2 the DHSC Supplies are appropriate for use by the Provider to carry out the Testing in accordance with the Guidance, applicable instructions for use and the T&amp;Cs; and</p>

<p>5.3.3 the DHSC Supplies are of the necessary quality and standard to enable the Provider to carry out the Testing and free from material defects.

<p>5.4 Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, any DHSC Supplies provided by DHSC for use by the Provider:</p>

<p>5.4.1 shall be provided at DHSC’s sole discretion (save that DHSC will use reasonable endeavours to meet any volumes agreed with the Provider);</p>

<p>5.4.2 shall be inspected by the Provider after receipt in order that the Provider can confirm that the DHSC Supplies that have been delivered include the expected quantity and type of DHSC Supplies;</p>

<p>6.4 In the event that either party receives a data rights request relating to personal data processed under or in connection with this agreement, such party will ensure that such request is appropriately actioned in respect of the personal data for which the recipient of the request is a data controller.</p>

<p>6.5 Where applicable, each party agrees to comply with the obligations placed on it in Schedule 1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Confidential information</h3>

<p>7.1 For the purposes of this T&amp;Cs, “Confidential Information” shall mean information, data (including personal data) and material of any nature, which either party may receive or obtain in connection with the conclusion and/or operation of the T&amp;Cs which is designated as confidential by either party or that ought reasonably to be considered as confidential.</p>

<p>7.3 Notwithstanding clause 7.2:</p>

<p>7.4 Nothing in the T&amp;Cs shall restrict or prevent DHSC from disclosing the name and address of the Provider to any other organisation involved in the DHSC COVID-19 testing programme.</p>

<p>7.5 Notwithstanding the termination or expiry of the T&amp;Cs, this clause shall be valid for a further period of seven years from the date of termination or expiry.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Freedom of Information Act</h3>

<p>8.2 The Provider further acknowledges that DHSC may be obliged to disclose any information (including Confidential Information) which it holds in response to a request received under FOIA, and that the extent, content and format of the disclosure is DHSC’s decision.</p>

<p>8.3 The Provider shall ensure that all Information (as defined in section 84 of Freedom of Information Act 2000) produced in the course of the T&amp;Cs or relating to the T&amp;Cs is retained for disclosure for a period of seven (7) years from the date of expiry or termination of the T&amp;Cs and shall permit DHSC to inspect such records as requested from time to time during the Term of the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>8.4 In no event shall the Provider respond directly to a Request For Information (as defined in the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and such term shall include its equivalent under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004) related or otherwise connected to DHSC or this T&amp;Cs unless expressly authorised to do so by DHSC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> Liability</h3>

<p>9.1 The parties expressly exclude liability for loss of data, profits, business, goodwill or anticipated savings, and all other indirect or consequential loss or damages suffered or incurred by a party under or in connection with the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>9.2 Nothing in the T&amp;Cs shall limit or exclude either party’s liability for:</p>

<p>9.2.1 death or personal injury or damage to property caused by negligence on the part of that party or its employees, contractors or agents; or</p>

<span class="number">10. </span> Costs</h3>

<p>10.1 Each party shall bear its own costs in relation to the Testing and carrying out its responsibilities under the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<h3>

<p>11.2 Either party may immediately terminate the T&amp;Cs by issuing a notice in writing to the other party if the other party is in material breach of any obligation in the T&amp;Cs which is either incapable or remedy or, where capable of remedy, that breach is not remedied within seven (7) days of receiving notice specifying the breach and requiring it to be remedied.</p>

<p>11.3 On termination or expiry of the T&amp;Cs, the Provider shall promptly return to DHSC at DHSC’s request, all other equipment, materials and property that DHSC has supplied to the Provider in connection with the Testing, including the testing kits, which are unused and which have not been distributed to Test Subjects.</p>

<p>11.4 The termination of the T&amp;Cs shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of a party which may have accrued at the date of termination.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span> Change in applicable law or guidance</h3>

<p>12.1 Neither party shall be liable to the other party for any delay or failure to perform, its obligations under the T&amp;Cs (other than a payment of money) to the extent that such delay or failure is a result of changes in applicable law and/or government guidance which mean that the Testing cannot be carried out (in all material respects) without such laws and/or government guidance being breached, or if either party can reasonably demonstrate that despite all reasonable endeavours it is unable to secure the supply of non-COVID-19 infected personnel to the Testing due to the levels of COVID-19 infections in the population of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>12.2 Notwithstanding clause 12.1, each party shall use all reasonable endeavours to continue to perform its obligations under the T&amp;Cs to the extent possible (in accordance with applicable laws and guidance), which may include only providing part of the Testing.</p>

<p>12.3 However, if either party is prevented from performing its material obligations under the T&amp;Cs and the parties are unable to agree a way to facilitate the continued performance of the T&amp;Cs, either party may terminate the T&amp;Cs with immediate effect by notice in writing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> Publicity</h3>

<p>13.1 Save for the publicity carried out by the parties in promoting the Testing to potential Test Subjects in accordance with the T&amp;Cs, neither party shall make any press announcement in relation to the T&amp;Cs or any part of it in any way, without the prior written consent of the other party.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14. </span> General</h3>

<p>14.1 The parties irrevocably agree that the T&amp;Cs shall be subject to the laws of England and Wales and that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and settle any dispute in connection with the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>14.2 In the event of the transfer of all or a substantial part of DHSC’s activities to one or more government bodies, DHSC’s rights and obligations shall, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the T&amp;Cs, automatically transfer to such other government body.</p>

<p>14.3 Except as provided elsewhere in the T&amp;Cs, a person who is not a party to the T&amp;Cs shall not have any rights under or in connection with it.</p>

<p>14.4 If any part of the T&amp;Cs is prohibited by law or judged by a court to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, it must be read as if that part was removed from the T&amp;Cs as much as required and rendered ineffective as far as possible without affecting the rest of the T&amp;Cs, whether its valid or enforceable</p>

<p>14.5 DHSC may amend the T&amp;Cs at any time by issuing a notification to the Provider of the amendments to the T&amp;Cs. If the Provider does not wish to continue with Testing on the basis of any updated T&amp;Cs, it may terminate these T&amp;Cs by giving notice in writing to DHSC. Any amendments shall be effective seven (7) days following the date of receipt by the Provider of notification, provided that DHSC has not within such seven (7) days received a notice from the Provider to terminate these T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>14.6 Notices shall be sent to such address as the relevant party may give notice to the other party for the purpose of service of notices under the T&amp;Cs.</p>

<p>14.7 The Provider will communicate any changes in their eligibility status in respect of accessing existing testing provisions to facilitate COVID-19 testing of the Provider’s Test Subjects in accordance with DHSC guidance, including but not limited to any pre-requisite requirements of receiving those testing provisions, such as an active and valid contract for delivering NHS services.</p>
