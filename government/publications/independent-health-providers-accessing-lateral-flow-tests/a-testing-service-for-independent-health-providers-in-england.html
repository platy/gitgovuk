<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Independent health providers (<abbr title="independent health providers">IHPs</abbr>) can access lateral flow testing kits (<abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr>) directly from NHS Test and Trace. This replaces the ordering route currently provided by NHS England and NHS Improvement.</p>

<p>This service enables patient-facing staff working in Independent Health Providers to twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> testing; deliveries will cover a minimum period of 28 days.</p>

<h2>Webinars</h2>

<p>For more information you can join our webinars. These live webinars will talk you through the end to end process for IHP testing and include a live Q&amp;A with the IHP team, who will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

<h2>Summary: testing for Independent Health Providers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Managers should order <abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr> for each staff member; deliveries will cover a minimum period of 28 days. It is recommended to order sufficient tests to cover 7 weeks' worth of standard testing to allow for a 3-week buffer of <abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr> at any time.</li>
  <li>Twice weekly patient-facing staff should take a test at home and register the result online. All results must be registered whether negative, positive or void.</li>
  <li>Patient-facing staff will receive their results within 30 minutes of conducting the test.</li>
  <li>If a patient-facing member of staff receives a positive <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> result they should conduct a confirmatory PCR test immediately, isolate until they receive a result, and notify their employer. Staff members can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">order a PCR test</a>.</li>
  <li>Patient-facing staff repeats <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> testing cycling twice each week</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any queries with any of the steps, call the national coronavirus contact centre on 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why testing is important</h3>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies personal assistants who currently have COVID-19 so they are able to self-isolate if positive</li>
  <li>protects those receiving care from infection passed to them by personal assistants who are confirmed positive</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h2>End to end process: managers</h2>

<h3>Terms and conditions</h3>

<p>Review the Terms and Conditions prior to ordering test kits. By commencing using test kits you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions. Please ensure you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-health-providers-accessing-lateral-flow-tests/privacy-notice-for-use-by-independent-health-providers">download the Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h3>Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The manager is responsible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">ordering test kits for all patient-facing staff</a>.</p>

<p>To order test kits the manager will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</li>
  <li>total number of patient-facing staff for testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Personal assistants, or the individual employer on their behalf, must order one box of 7 <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> test kits.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace will assign all participating organisations with a single <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>. Managers will receive their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> via the email provided by NHS England and NHS Improvement. Staff will need to use the <abbr title="independent health providers">IHPs</abbr> <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> to register completed test kits.</p>

<p>When ordering you will be asked to enter the number of residents or non-staff. You should enter â0â for this.</p>

<p>Once you have placed an order, you will receive a confirmatory email from this address: organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have any issues with any of the steps, call the national coronavirus contact centre on 119.</p>
</div>

<h3>Delivery and distribution</h3>

<h4>Delivery</h4>
<p>You will receive a box containing 56 individual boxes each containing 7 <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> kits. Each box containing the 56 <abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr> is approximately the same size as the overhead hand luggage you take on a plane.</p>

<h4>Distribution</h4>

<p>Once your kits are delivered, inform your staff that kits have arrived or arrange for them to be distributed as appropriate.</p>

<p>Staff will need the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> of their IPH in order to correctly register their <abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr>. Make sure you have this information so that they have it available to them. Staff will need to re-enter their <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> each time they conduct an <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Data privacy notice</h4>

<p>Please ensure you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-health-providers-accessing-lateral-flow-tests/privacy-notice-for-use-by-independent-health-providers" class="govuk-link">download the privacy notice</a>. Please amend and either print or communicate the data privacy notice to ensure that staff participating in testing have sight of this. We recommend putting the guidance on a wall where test kits are distributed and in staff rooms.</p>

<h4>Tracking test kit distribution</h4>

<p>As an organisation distributing test kits you are obliged to keep a detailed record of any test kits provided for use at home or outside the organisation. In the unlikely event of any issues with a batch of test kits, organisations will be required to track the location of test kits. In order to do this the details below should be recorded and stored:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name, last name, telephone number and/or email address of test subject</li>
  <li>details of lot or batch number of each <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> home test kit given to each staff member (the lot number is found on the side of each box. It is 8 characters long: one letter followed by 7 numbers)</li>
  <li>date of issue to user</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tracking results</h4>

<p>When staff complete self-tests, you will not automatically receive a copy of their results. In order to receive results, you must request this information from staff directly. We recommend implementing a system for staff to share their results with you. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a shared Gmail account</li>
  <li>WhatsApp group</li>
  <li>nominated contact of your team</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have set up a system for results to be shared, make sure all staff are aware of the expectations for sharing their results before the first day of self-testing.</p>

<h2>End to end process: patient-facing staff</h2>

<h3>Ordering test kits</h3>

<p>The manager will inform staff when tests arrive and how they can be collected or distributed. Each staff member should collect 2 boxes of 7 <abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before testing be sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the guidance included with your test kit</li>
  <li>watch âHow to do a COVID-19 Self Testâ</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=S9XR8RZxKNo&amp;list=PLvaBZskxS7tzQYlVg7lwH5uxAD9UrSzGJ" rel="external" class="govuk-link">How to do a COVID-19 Self Test (rapid antigen test)</a></p>

<p>If a staff member becomes symptomatic, they should immediately self-isolate, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">order a confirmatory PCR test</a>. After conducting the test they should continue to self-isolate until they receive their PCR result.</p>

<h3>Using the test kits</h3>

<p>Personal assistants will conduct a combined throat and nose self-swab for the test.</p>

<p>If possible, please continue testing while on holiday (in the UK) or off work due to an illness not related to coronavirus.</p>

<p>After testing positive, you do not need to test again for 90 days unless you become symptomatic.</p>

<h3>Reading your result</h3>

<p>If a patient-facing staff member receives a negative result with an <abbr title="lateral flow testing kit">LFT</abbr> result and remain without symptoms they can continue working. Patient-facing staff must continue following all IPC measures such as wearing PPE, washing your hands and socially distancing where possible.</p>

<p>If any patient-facing staff member tests positive, they will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">order a confirmatory PCR test</a> and immediately self-isolate until they receive their PCR result.</p>

<h3>Registering test kits</h3>

<p>All test results must be registered online whether they are positive, negative or void. Personal assistants need to use this service every time they complete a self-test.</p>

<h4>Steps to register a test kit</h4>

</div>

<p>If any staff member cannot complete the online form, they can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call 119 and select option 1</li>
  <li>ask someone else to register on their behalf (provided they have written consent to do so and can obtain personal details required to complete the form)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Twice-weekly retesting</h3>

<p>After you have completed your first round of testing, patient-facing staff should continue to test using <abbr title="lateral flow testing kits">LFTs</abbr> twice weekly on the same days each week. If you have tested positive, you do not need to retest for 90 days unless you become symptomatic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Day 1: conduct test on day of planned testing, receive result and register test.</li>
  <li>Day 3 to 5: conduct test on day of planned testing, receive result and register test.</li>
  <li>Repeat testing process every 7 days.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
