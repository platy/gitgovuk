<p>This guide explains about the measles, mumps and rubella (<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr>) vaccination which helps protect against the 3 diseases.</p>

<p>People who have not been vaccinated with 2 doses of <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine are more likely to catch these diseases. Children do become ill when they catch them, but so do adults.</p>

<p>All 3 diseases can be very serious. They can make adults very ill and cause problems for women who are pregnant and people who have weakened immune systems (and can’t fight infection well).</p>

<p>Measles is a serious illness that is highly infectious. To be protected from measles and other infections including mumps and rubella, you need to be immunised with 2 doses of <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<h2>Measles</h2>

<p>Measles is caused by a very infectious virus causing a rash and high fever and can be very serious. The illness can be more severe in adults and can last for longer. Someone with measles usually has to spend about 5 days in bed and may be off school or work for 10 days. Adults are also at higher risk of complications.</p>

<p>Complications of measles can include ear and chest infections, fits, diarrhoea, encephalitis (infection of the brain), and brain damage. About one in 5,000 individuals with measles is likely to die. There have been 3 deaths from measles in England since 2006.</p>

<p>Measles is highly infectious – a cough or a sneeze can spread the measles virus over a wide area. If you come into contact with it and are not protected, the chances are that you will be infected.</p>

<p>If you think you have measles, call your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> or walk in centre before you visit. This is important – if you spend time with someone who has a weak immune system they can easily catch it and become seriously ill. So if you have symptoms of measles, call ahead and get advice.</p>

<h2>Mumps</h2>

<p>Mumps can cause viral meningitis, a very unpleasant condition. Painful complications of mumps can include inflammation of the ovaries or testicles, and in rarer cases, the pancreas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have missed your <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> there’s a good chance that you may catch mumps if you come into contact with someone with the disease. You need 2 doses of <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> to be fully immunised</li>
  <li>the only effective way to prevent mumps is to have 2 <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccinations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rubella</h2>
<p>Rubella (german measles) is a viral infection that’s now rare in the UK. It’s usually a mild condition that gets better without treatment in 7 to 10 days. Rubella is more serious for pregnant women.</p>

<p>Symptoms of rubella include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots</li>
  <li>swollen glands around the head and neck</li>
  <li>a high temperature (fever)</li>
  <li>cold-like symptoms such as a cough and runny nose</li>
  <li>aching and painful joints – more common in adults</li>
</ul>

<p>The symptoms of rubella usually only last a few days, but your glands may be swollen for several weeks.</p>

<p>You are at greatest risk if you have not been immunised with 2 doses of <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>If you can’t remember if you’ve had both <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccinations, it’s better to book an appointment to have <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine because extra doses pose no health risk. If you need 2 doses, they should ideally be given 3 months apart.</p>

<p>If you have missed one or both of your <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccinations contact your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> surgery to arrange an appointment.</p>

<p>By getting immunised you will not only be protecting yourself but also those people, especially children, who cannot have <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> because they have illnesses such as leukaemia. They are protected if enough of the population is vaccinated so measles is eliminated.</p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>

<p>Some people develop mild side effects such as a sore arm or mild rash or swollen glands after vaccination. More serious side effects are rare but occasionally a rash may develop up to 6 weeks after vaccination. If you are worried speak to your practice nurse or <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are having treatment for a serious condition such as a transplant or cancer, or you have a condition that affects your immune system such as <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> get advice from your nurse or doctor.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccines</h2>

<p>In the UK we have 2 <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccines. Both of the vaccines work very well, one contains porcine gelatine and the other doesn’t.</p>

<p>If you want to have or you want your child to have the porcine gelatine free vaccine, talk to your practice nurse or <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Measles is not just a problem for children</h2>

<p>If you care for individuals with a weakened immune system or young children as part of your work, it’s particularly important that you are fully immunised with <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr>. Passing on measles to children who are too young to have <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine or to someone who is already ill, can have very serious consequences for their health.</p>

<p>As a precaution, women should avoid getting pregnant for one month after <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination.</p>

<p>It’s never too late to have your <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/" rel="external"><abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination</a> is available on NHS.UK or you can phone the NHS on 111.</p>
