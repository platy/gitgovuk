<h2>Executive summary</h2>

<p>Building on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-coronavirus-covid-19-winter-plan-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">last year’s adult social care winter plan</a>, here we set out the key elements of national support available for the social care sector for winter 2021 to 2022, as well as the principal actions to take for local authorities, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations and social care providers across all settings, including those in the voluntary and community sector.</p>

<p>By working together, we will ensure that high-quality, safe, and timely care is provided to everyone who needs it, while we continue to protect people who need care, their carers and the social care workforce from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses.</p>

<h2>Our plan for adult social care this winter</h2>

<p>The last 18 months have been a difficult time for everyone involved in receiving or providing adult social care (<abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr>) and this coming winter will present new challenges. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation" class="govuk-link">Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>)</a> has advised that this winter will be the first in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> when COVID-19 will circulate alongside other respiratory viruses, including the seasonal flu virus.</p>

<p>Through our regular conversations and dialogue with people and organisations across the sector, we recognise there are many challenges facing adult social care in addition to the winter-specific pressures covered in this plan. That is why on 7 September 2021, the Prime Minister set out an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/build-back-better-our-plan-for-health-and-social-care" class="govuk-link">ambitious plan for adult social care reform, alongside other measures to support recovery in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr></a>. This plan commits to investing £5.4 billion over the next 3 years into adult social care, and includes funding for the social care workforce and for local authorities to enable them to move towards paying providers and individual employers a fair and sustainable rate of care.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks and months, we are working with people who draw on social care, providers and other partners to co-produce more detail on our plans for reform of adult social care, and we will publish further detail in a white paper for reform later this year.</p>

<p>Winter 2020 to 2021 was a particularly difficult time for the country as a whole as we were gripped by the second wave of the pandemic.</p>

<p>In September 2020, we published the first <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-coronavirus-covid-19-winter-plan-2020-to-2021">adult social care (COVID-19) winter plan</a> outlining how the sector would overcome the challenges it faced. 
Sir David Pearson (former Director of Adult Social Care in Nottinghamshire) and the Stakeholder Group (that consisted of many members of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/social-care-sector-covid-19-support-taskforce" class="govuk-link">Social Care Sector COVID-19 Support Taskforce</a> that met between 15 June and 28 August 2020), undertook an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-adult-social-care-covid-19-winter-plan-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">independent review of the implementation of that winter plan</a> as part of our ongoing efforts to constantly review and adapt our response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The review found that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While COVID-19 accounted for around 40% of all deaths of care home residents between April and June 2020 in the first wave of the pandemic, it accounted for only a quarter (26%) of all care home resident deaths between September 2020 and February 2021 in the second wave. This compares with a global average of 41% between March 2020 and January 2021.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Whilst cause and effect is difficult to unpick, the evidence strongly suggests that the actions taken since the beginning of the pandemic, including those outlined in the winter plan, have had a significant impact in reducing risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The review also found that, of the 123 commitments that we made in last year’s winter plan, the vast majority (113 or 92%) were implemented in full.</p>

<p>The review made 33 recommendations for the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), as well as other sector partners, to action in preparation for this coming winter, and <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex">Annex A</a> of this paper details our progress in implementing them.</p>

<p>We are entering winter 2021 to 2022 in a better position than last year because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>according to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England statistics on COVID-19 vaccinations</a>, over 95% of residents in older adult care homes, who were designated by the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> as the highest priority for vaccination, have now been fully vaccinated – there is clear evidence that this provides significant protection (according to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines">Office for National Statistics’ COVID-19 latest insights: vaccines</a>), and the government accepted the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>’s advice to roll out a booster campaign for COVID-19 vaccinations, which began on 16 September 2021</li>
  <li>a very high proportion of staff working in adult social care are double vaccinated. 88% of staff working in older adult care homes, and 85% of those working in care homes for younger adults or Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>)-registered home care providers are now fully vaccinated (according to <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England statistics on COVID-19 vaccinations</a>. From 11 November 2021, anyone working or volunteering inside a <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered residential care home will need to be fully vaccinated unless they are exempt</li>
</ul>

<p>The success of the vaccination programme has meant that we have been able to remove most of the restrictions in care homes and all restrictions across the rest of the population. We continue to support prevention measures across the sector, including personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), testing, and infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>).</p>

<p>The 1.5 million people who make up the paid social care workforce and the 5.4 million people who provide unpaid care have worked tirelessly to support people in all circumstances. Their willingness to adhere to strict testing and infection prevention regimes, and engage so positively in the national vaccination programme has had a huge impact on infection and mortality rates over the last few months.</p>

<p>Winter 2020 to 2021 saw significantly fewer deaths in care homes from all causes than the first wave; this was furthered once the vaccination programme started in January 2021 and the picture improved significantly.</p>

<p>We have been successful thanks to collaborative working between national government, local partners and providers. We will build on this collaboration, engaging with partners and providers in all parts of the sector so that we are best prepared to face this winter’s challenges, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an increasingly stretched adult social care workforce, with recruitment continuing to be difficult in many places</li>
  <li>the infection risk posed by the possibility of a new COVID-19 variant of concern, as well as other respiratory viruses, despite the improved <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> practice across the sector since the pandemic began</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the most clinically vulnerable individuals in our society receive care and support, and it will be important that we help them protect themselves in a context where restrictions in the wider society have been lifted.</p>

<p>To support the health and social care system to meet these challenges, this winter we are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing £388.3 million in further funding to support <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>, testing and vaccination uptake in adult social care settings; this is in addition to a further £478 million to continue enhanced hospital discharge support until March 2022</li>
  <li>providing eligible frontline social care workers and carers with free flu vaccination this season, ensuring that pharmacists are able to vaccinate staff and recipients of care in care homes, and that frontline social care workers can continue booking their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine through the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/">National Booking Service</a>
</li>
  <li>continuing to provide free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 needs to the adult social care sector until the end of March 2022, with sufficient stock to cope throughout winter. Regular asymptomatic COVID-19 testing will be maintained, with availability of more intense testing regimes for higher-risk settings. <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) are prepared to arrange multi-virus testing when required for respiratory viruses in care homes</li>
  <li>continuing to support care providers to make best use of technology to support remote monitoring, enable secure online communications, and enable people within care homes to remain connected with friends and families</li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide workforce recruitment and retention funding to support local authorities and providers to recruit and retain sufficient staff over winter, and support growth in workforce capacity of the existing workforce. This will be subject to conditions for local authorities to ensure it is used to address local workforce pressures, which will be published shortly.</p>

<p>Alongside these commitments, we have worked with our partners across the health and social care system to set out the national support we are providing, and our recommendations and expectations of local authorities, <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations and adult social care providers. The remainder of this plan sets out those commitments and recommendations in more detail.</p>

<h2>Preventing and controlling the spread of infection in care settings</h2>

<h3>Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in care settings has always protected staff and individuals against a range of infections. We have a stable <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supply chain with sufficient stock to cope with future spikes or waves, and to see us through winter.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We will continue to provide free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 needs to the adult social care sector until the end of March 2022.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered providers, this will be via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal</a> and for adult social care providers who are not <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered (including personal assistants, unpaid carers who do not live with the person they care for, supported living, extra care, shared lives and day services), this will be via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers">local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>) or local authorities</a> where <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr> have ceased regular distribution of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>We are currently <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/extending-free-ppe-to-the-health-and-care-sector" class="govuk-link">consulting on extending free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the health and care sector after the current end date of 31 March 2022</a>. Government will respond to the findings of this consultation and announce any decisions concerning <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provision post-March 2022 before the end of the year.</p>

<p>We have worked with care sector representative bodies to produce tailored <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-domiciliary-care/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-resource-for-care-workers-delivering-domiciliary-care-during-sustained-covid-19-transmission-in-england" class="govuk-link">home care (sometimes called domiciliary care)</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">care homes</a>. This guidance is applicable to a range of adult social care settings, is kept under constant review, and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will continue to update the guidance as new evidence emerges.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promote use of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal</a> for <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered care providers</li>
  <li>maintain a system for provision of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to non <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered providers, either directly or through the <abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>report any shortages of local authority and <abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr> <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> supplies to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers and individual employers</h4>

<p>Providers and individual employers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should make use of government-provided free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in line with guidance on use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-resource-for-care-workers-working-in-care-homes-during-sustained-covid-19-transmission-in-england">care homes</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-domiciliary-care/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-resource-for-care-workers-delivering-domiciliary-care-during-sustained-covid-19-transmission-in-england">home care settings</a>
</li>
  <li>that are
    <ul>
      <li>registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> should use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-emergency-personal-protective-equipment" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal</a> to access free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
      <li>not registered with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> (including personal assistants and unpaid carers who do not live with the person they care for) should obtain <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> from their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr> or local authority</a> (if their <abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr> no longer distributes <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 and flu testing</h3>

<p>Regular asymptomatic COVID-19 testing will be maintained throughout winter for all staff and unpaid carers in adult social care, as well as more intense testing regimes in settings deemed higher risk, in line with clinical advice. To date, we have sent out more than 41 million polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) swab test kits and 113 million lateral flow devices (<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr>) to care homes.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and regional public health laboratories are prepared to arrange multi-virus testing when required for investigation of suspected outbreaks of respiratory viruses in care homes, enabling the right treatment pathways. See our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acute-respiratory-disease-managing-outbreaks-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">guidance on managing outbreaks of influenza-like illness in care homes</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, we are using the experience and learning from COVID-19 testing to continue to improve testing for other viruses, including flu. Community, general practitioner (<abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>) and hospital indicators of influenza are reported in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-flu-reports">weekly national influenza surveillance reports</a>.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We will provide a further £126.3 million to continue to support the sector to deliver COVID-19 testing from October 2021 to the end of March 2022. Over £520 million in testing funding has been provided from December 2020 to March 2022 to help support the sector with costs associated with ongoing testing. We will keep our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">guidance on the COVID-19 testing strategy for adult social care</a> up to date.</p>

<p>We will continue to make COVID-19 testing data available to the sector. This will be available to organisations managing care homes, home care, extra care and supported living, and day care, who are accessing testing in line with our guidance. Care home and home care organisations can access this data through the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://capacitytracker.com/">Capacity Tracker</a>, and other organisations receive regular emails containing their data.</p>

<p>The existing systems for multi-virus testing (including flu) of care homes remain in place and can be deployed when required for outbreak investigations, based on the risk assessment of the responsible <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>’s consultant in communicable disease control or consultant in health protection and in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acute-respiratory-disease-managing-outbreaks-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure care providers, as far as possible, carry out COVID-19 in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">guidance on the COVID-19 testing strategy for adult social care</a>
</li>
  <li>provide local support for testing if needed, working with local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations as required</li>
  <li>monitor their local COVID-19 testing data to identify and act on emerging concerns as advised by public health authorities, including following up with care settings that are not undertaking regular testing</li>
  <li>pass on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-and-testing-fund" class="govuk-link">Infection Control and Testing Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>)</a> to care homes and parts of the wider adult social care sector, and report regularly on how this funding is being spent by providers</li>
  <li>support providers in managing multi-virus testing (including for influenza) where need is identified by the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in an outbreak area, refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers#local-action-to-respond-to-prevalence-and-outbreaks" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 contain framework</a> and follow the local outbreak plan as directed by their director of public health</li>
  <li>refer to the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> care home outbreak standard operating procedure (<abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr>), which is used by operational <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> staff, as well as sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acute-respiratory-disease-managing-outbreaks-in-care-homes">guidance for managing outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses in care homes</a>
</li>
  <li>support settings in managing suspected and confirmed influenza cases and outbreaks, including testing when reported by providers in accordance with previous guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>Clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>) should ensure that the mechanics and practical arrangements for securing supply, delivery, prescribing and dispensing of flu antivirals for care home residents and staff are in place. These arrangements should be robust and tested as being able to provide antiviral medication to residents and staff within the timescales set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/localised-community-outbreaks-influenza-out-of-season-template-procedure.docx" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England’s localised community outbreaks of influenza template procedure</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clarification-contracting-arrangements-post-exposure-prophylaxis-antiviral-drugs-lil-letter.pdf" class="govuk-link">related guidance</a>.</p>

<p>As <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> may have been merged and therefore reconfigured since these functions were last used at scale in the winter of 2019 to 2020, the <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> regional flu or winter planning lead should ensure that their <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> has arrangements in place suitable to their current configuration.</p>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should ensure all staff are aware of how to use and access the testing regimes for people with and without symptoms, including for people who have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 – staff need to understand or know how to find out when different test types or kits should be used (for example, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests or <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr>)</p>

<p>All residential care settings should engage with <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> where suspected or confirmed cases of influenza have been identified and take the appropriate action in accordance with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acute-respiratory-disease-managing-outbreaks-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">guidance on the recognition and management of cases and outbreaks</a>. This may include antiviral treatments, which are most effective the earlier they are taken, and therefore early engagement with <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> is important for accessing these promptly.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines</h3>

<p>This year, we face another challenging autumn and winter, with COVID-19 still in circulation and an increased risk during flu season. This season, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-september-2021-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> indicates that this risk could be up to 50% larger than typically seen in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></a> because the level of population immunity against influenza is expected to be lower than usual as a result of how little flu circulated last winter.</p>

<p>With the majority of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> population now having received a COVID-19 vaccine, the success of the COVID-19 vaccines programme has had a significant impact on reducing the risk to death and serious illness during this coming autumn and winter.</p>

<p>There is, however, early evidence that the levels of protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines reduce over time, particularly in older individuals who are at greater risk from the virus. The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has consequently advised that those in priority groups 1 to 9 should be offered a COVID-19 booster no earlier than 6 months after completion of their primary course.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, more important than ever that frontline health and social care workers are vaccinated against both COVID-19 and flu, in order to protect themselves and the people to whom they provide care.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>Protection against COVID-19 will be boosted following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-issues-updated-advice-on-covid-19-booster-vaccination"><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>’s advice on COVID-19 boosters</a>. From 16 September 2021, the government began rolling out booster vaccinations to those in <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> cohorts 1 to 9 who received their second dose more than 6 months ago, and boosters are now being delivered and administered to older adult care home residents and staff within their homes.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> is maintaining its evergreen offer, ensuring that all frontline social care workers can continue to book their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine through the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">National Booking Service</a>.</p>

<p>We have made frontline social care workers and carers who are unable to get the vaccine through their employer eligible for a free flu vaccination this season. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flu-immunisation-for-social-care-staff/flu-vaccination-guidance-for-social-care-workers" class="govuk-link">guidance on flu vaccinations for social care workers</a>.</p>

<p>We have also ensured that <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practices and pharmacists are able to vaccinate staff and recipients of care in care homes at the same time. In some cases, both COVID-19 boosters and flu vaccinations may be co-administered during the same appointment.</p>

<p>We have made regulations so that, from 11 November 2021, being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will be a condition of deployment for people working or volunteering in care homes, unless they are exempt. These requirements will apply to all <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered care homes in England that provide accommodation for persons who require nursing or personal care.</p>

<p>We launched a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/making-vaccination-a-condition-of-deployment-in-the-health-and-wider-social-care-sector" class="govuk-link">consultation on whether or not to extend the requirement for people to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (and flu) across the health sector and other social care services</a>, which closed on 22 October 2021. We are in the process of carefully considering the responses and feedback received.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support communications campaigns encouraging eligible social care workers, unpaid carers and people who receive care to receive a free COVID-19 vaccine, and flu vaccine, as appropriate</li>
  <li>work with local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> partners to facilitate and encourage the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines (and flu vaccines where appropriate), in line with the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> standard operating procedures, to social care workers, unpaid carers and residents in care homes</li>
  <li>provide consolidated information on vaccination uptake via the national <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://capacitytracker.com/">Capacity Tracker</a>
</li>
  <li>ensure all care homes in their area are able to meet the new requirement to make vaccination a condition of deployment. They should work with care homes to support them to review and strengthen their contingency plans, as well as reviewing their own contingency plans; clarify the potential impact on services locally; and be able to respond, escalating risks where necessary via <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> regional teams</li>
  <li>ensure any <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and local authority staff who are visiting a care home for work purposes are fully vaccinated – from 11 November 2021, it will be a requirement for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and local authority staff to be fully vaccinated in order to work inside a care home, unless they are exempt</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support and promote to all staff the importance of receiving a free flu vaccination, as well as COVID-19 vaccines (including boosters for those eligible)</li>
  <li>ensure that, from 11 November 2021, only workers or volunteers who are fully vaccinated or are exempt from this requirement are deployed into care homes</li>
  <li>report seasonal flu vaccination rates, alongside COVID-19 vaccination rates, for staff and residents in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://capacitytracker.com/" rel="external">Capacity Tracker</a>
</li>
  <li>encourage social care workers to get the flu vaccine as soon as they are offered it to protect themselves and the people they look after</li>
  <li>consult the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-flu-immunisation-programme-and-covid-19/health-matters-delivering-the-flu-immunisation-programme-during-the-covid-19-pandemic">flu vaccination guidance for social care workers</a>
</li>
  <li>encourage (where possible) all visitors to care homes who are eligible for the flu vaccine to get it ahead of visiting – the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flu-immunisation-programme-plan/national-flu-immunisation-programme-2021-to-2022-letter" class="govuk-link">annual flu letter</a> sets out who is eligible for a free <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> flu vaccine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Infection prevention and outbreak management</h3>

<p>Good infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) practice will continue to be essential in all settings, but particularly in those at high risk of larger outbreaks, such as residential care. This includes taking steps to improve ventilation.</p>

<p>The same non-pharmaceutical interventions that successfully reduce transmission of COVID-19 also work against influenza (flu). Flu is cross-transmitted via secretions and will require contact and droplet precautions. Hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, social distancing, environmental cleaning, use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, waste disposal (as clinical waste) and other COVID-19 precautions are useful for the prevention of flu transmission. Ventilation of rooms and regular cleaning is also effective against influenza and other viruses such as norovirus.</p>

<p>Over the coming months, further steps will be taken to support improved ventilation, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>launch of the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Champions Network, led by the Chief Nurse, to provide a forum for the sector to share ventilation best practice</li>
  <li>publication of a good practice guide covering best practice examples on improving ventilation and other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures</li>
  <li>updating of existing guidance to ensure ventilation is included</li>
</ul>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We  provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/overview-of-adult-social-care-guidance-on-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance portal specifically for adult social care providers</a>, including guidance and support on <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> (in order to prevent COVID-19, influenza and other infectious illnesses), testing, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, COVID-19/flu vaccines and staff movement.</p>

<p>On ventilation, there is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-guidance-for-maintaining-services-within-health-and-care-settings-infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations" class="govuk-link">guidance from <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> on mitigations to tackle poor ventilation in adult social care settings</a>.</p>

<p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>) have also published <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/infections/covid19" rel="external" class="govuk-link">clinical guidance on managing COVID-19</a>, including for suspected or confirmed <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng138" rel="external" class="govuk-link">pneumonia in adults in the community</a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Champions Network, hosted by the Queen’s Nursing Institute (a forum composed of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> experts across the adult social care sector) is due to be launched in November 2021, which will share and disseminate best practice on <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> and ventilation.</p>

<p>We have published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/respiratory-tract-infections-infection-control" class="govuk-link">guidance on the control of respiratory tract infections</a>.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work with all relevant partners, including <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and local health protection boards, to control local outbreaks in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers#local-outbreak" class="govuk-link">contain framework</a>
</li>
  <li>refer to the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> best practice examples and case studies published alongside the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> Champions Network launch – for example, local authorities and providers can collaborate with <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> nurses to ensure robust <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> practices are in place within adult social care settings</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to follow all relevant guidance on how to prevent, control and manage infections and outbreaks in their care setting , liaising fully with their <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and other local partners as needed</li>
  <li>ensure all care staff have ongoing training on infection prevention and control, and the appropriate use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, and can engage with online <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/residential-adult-social-care/infection-prevention-control-care-homes" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/COVID-19-Essential-training.ASPX" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Skills for Care</a> training resources for learning reviews when available</li>
  <li>not routinely deploy staff to provide nursing or personal care if those individuals are also providing a regulated activity in another health or care setting, to reduce the risk of infections and outbreaks in care homes. However, in order to allow providers and local authorities to plan proactively for potential staffing capacity issues, and to ensure continuity of care, some limited movement of fully vaccinated staff may be necessary. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> are updating the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricting-workforce-movement-between-care-homes-and-other-care-settings">staff movement guidance</a> to set out the circumstances in which such staff movement can take place, and the steps providers should take to manage the infection risks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visiting in care homes</h3>

<p>It is critical to support all people who receive care to safely meet with their loved ones, even in the most high-risk settings. Residents should have visiting opportunities throughout the winter, in line with current government and local guidance, as outlined below.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We regularly update our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">guidance on care home visiting</a> to outline how providers can take a dynamic risk-based approach to support safe visiting in and out of care settings, with the support of their local director of public health (<abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr>) where required.</p>

<p>We have strengthened the recognition of the role of essential care givers to ensure residents can have visitors in most circumstances, including during an outbreak.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Directors of public health (<abbr title="directors of public health">DPHs</abbr>) and directors of adult social services (<abbr title="directors of adult social services">DASSs</abbr>) have an important role to play in supporting visiting, and in supporting the care home to deliver safe visits into care homes. This may be through a dedicated care home outbreak management team or group, often in partnership with local social care commissioners. The <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> should work with the local <abbr title="director of adult social services">DASS</abbr> in developing and communicating their advice to care homes.</p>

<p>Local authorities should support visiting, recognising its importance for resident welfare – any decision to take a more restrictive approach should be proportionate, targeted and time limited.</p>

<p>In all cases, exemptions to any local restrictions should be made for visits to residents at the end of their lives.</p>

<p>Local restrictions should also respect the role of essential caregivers, including allowing them to visit in most circumstances.</p>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>Care home providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop and update visiting policies that enable visiting, where it is possible to do so, while keeping residents safe – this should be done in line with published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes">guidance on care home visiting</a> (which covers testing, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and individual risk assessments)</li>
  <li>ensure that all residents can nominate an essential caregiver</li>
  <li>encourage visitors to get the COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine before visiting, if eligible</li>
  <li>advise visitors to stay away from care settings if they have any flu symptoms</li>
  <li>in the case of an outbreak, stop visits in and out of the care home, unless from an essential caregiver or for an end-of-life visit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collaboration across health and care services</h2>

<h3>Preventing avoidable admissions</h3>

<p>Pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> this winter is likely to be significant, so it’s more important than ever for the adult social care sector to continue their fantastic collaboration and support for their local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> partners – such as primary care services and local community health services – to prevent avoidable hospital admissions from occurring, and to keep people well, independent and out of hospital. <abbr title="directors of adult social services">DASSs</abbr> have a central role to play in helping to achieve this aim.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>The Better Care Fund (<abbr title="Better Care Fund">BCF</abbr>) is the national policy driving forward the integration of health and social care in England. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-care-fund-policy-framework-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Better Care Fund">BCF</abbr> policy framework: 2021 to 2022</a> includes details on funding, national conditions and metrics. As set out in the framework, from October 2021, systems will be asked to set ambitions for reductions in avoidable admissions (classified as the rate of emergency admissions for chronic ambulatory sensitive conditions), and for metrics related to discharge. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/better-care-fund-planning-requirements-2021-22/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England’s <abbr title="Better Care Fund">BCF</abbr> planning requirements for 2021 to 2022</a> set out further operational guidance for local areas.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> community health services are providing crisis response care to prevent avoidable hospital admissions and accelerate the treatment of people’s urgent care needs. In line with <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England’s <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/community-health-services/community-crisis-response-services/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">national community crisis response services guidance</a>, all integrated care systems (<abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr>) in England are working to ensure delivery of the national community 2-hour crisis response standard by 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>From October 2021, as part of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cardiovascular Disease (<abbr title="caridovascular disease">CVD</abbr>) Prevention and Diagnosis primary care network (<abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr>) service specification, <abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> will undertake activity to improve coverage of blood pressure checks and diagnosis of patients with hypertension</li>
  <li>Tackling Neighbourhood Inequalities <abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr> service specification, practices are expected to deliver an annual learning disability health check for at least 75% of patients identified as having a learning disability on the learning disability register. Practices within <abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> will also identify and include patients with severe mental illness on the severe mental illness register, and are expected to deliver annual comprehensive physical checks for at least 302,000 people with severe mental illness in 2021 to 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically for care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> – working with community healthcare providers – are responsible for delivering elements of <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/enhanced-health-in-care-homes-framework/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England’s enhanced health in care homes (<abbr title="enhanced health in care homes">EHCH</abbr>) framework</a>, as described in the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/network-contract-des-specification-2021-22/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">network contract directed enhanced service (DES) contract specification</a>. This includes the alignment of every home to a named <abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr>, the introduction of a named clinical lead for every care home, and a weekly care home round or ‘check-in’ backed by multidisciplinary team support</li>
  <li>pulse oximeters are available to care homes that do not have the recommended number of devices (one per 25 beds), which, used under clinical supervision, can help identify ‘silent hypoxia’ and rapid deterioration of people with COVID-19</li>
  <li>remote monitoring is available to support care home residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (and face-to-face assessment where clinically appropriate)</li>
  <li>training on monitoring the deteriorating person in a care home is planned to cover 9,500 care homes by March 2022, delivered by Patient Safety Collaboratives, commissioned by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>), and using recognised deterioration tools (such as NEWS2, Restore2 mini and others) to facilitate a structured communication between care worker and clinician. NHSX has been supporting the digital enablement of early detection of deterioration in care home residents, and ability of health and care teams to access clinical information to enable more appropriate decision-making around clinical care requirements and delivery</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p><abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> should work with care home providers to continue to support home oximetry, including identifying local need for oximeters.</p>

<p><abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> should continue to deliver the <abbr title="enhanced health in care homes">EHCH</abbr> service requirements and ensure that all their partner care homes know who their clinical lead is and the support available to them, including home oximetry.</p>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>Care home providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarise themselves with the <abbr title="enhanced health in care homes">EHCH</abbr> service requirements and what they can expect from <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> agencies – the Care Providers Alliance published helpful <a href="https://careprovideralliance.org.uk/enhanced-health-in-care-homes-cpa-guide" rel="external" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="enhanced health in care homes">EHCH</abbr> guidance for care homes</a> in January 2021</li>
  <li>work collaboratively with clinical leads to deliver optimum care and support to their residents</li>
  <li>work with the local <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> to determine local need for oximeters</li>
  <li>link up with local community health services to enable referrals from care homes into urgent community response (<abbr title="urgent community response">UCR</abbr>) teams and ensure all staff understand what support is available locally</li>
</ul>

<p>Home care staff and social workers should understand how <abbr title="urgent community response">UCR</abbr> services work in their respective area and professional setting to enable speedy referrals if there are concerns about the people they care for who may be struggling at home with their health and approaching a crisis.</p>

<h3>Technology and digital support</h3>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented shift towards digitally enabled health and care services. Improvements in the technology available have helped people stay in contact with loved ones more easily and have made it easier for the social care workforce to access the information they need to deliver care.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>NHSX, a joint unit of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England, will provide a package of support over the winter to help care providers make the best use of digital tools, safely and securely. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new ring-fenced care provider Digitising Social Care fund of up to £8 million. This will be available to <abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr> and will fund – but is not limited to – improved internet connections, devices, acoustic monitoring, digital social care record solutions and other care technologies. This is part of NHSX’s Unified Tech Fund (<abbr title="Unified Tech Fund">UTF</abbr>) and was launched on 18 October 2021. <abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr> can find out how to apply in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/digitise-connect-transform/unified-tech-fund/unified-tech-fund-prospectus/"><abbr title="Unified Tech Fund">UTF</abbr> prospectus</a>
</li>
  <li>continued provision of guidance and support for the safe adoption of products that enable care providers to access <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> record information for people within their care – this will continue to support the <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> proxy access roll-out, giving staff the ability to order medications online on behalf of their residents and access information in the <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> record as locally agreed</li>
  <li>providing implementation funding support to all 7 <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> regions to significantly increase levels of technology-enabled remote monitoring within care homes. Plans have been agreed for over 100,000 people living in a care home to receive digitally enabled support by March 2022</li>
  <li>expanded direct support to care providers to meet minimum cyber standards in every local authority area in England, responding to the elevated cyber threat caused by the pandemic and rapid digitisation</li>
  <li>continued support for all social care providers in accessing NHSmail and Microsoft Teams. Those providers registered for NHSmail but not meeting <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/">Data Security and Protection Toolkit (<abbr title="Data Security and Protection Toolkit">DSPT</abbr>) requirements</a> as of 30 June 2021 will also be supported to meet these requirements by 30 June 2022</li>
  <li>an extended support offer for the NHSX iPads in care homes beyond December 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>NHSX will also provide access to online guidance and training for care providers. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on safe use of technology, digitisation in the workplace and appropriate internet connections in care on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.digitalsocialcare.co.uk/">Digital Social Care website</a>
</li>
  <li>a range of online training resources to support remote consultations for health and social care staff via Health Education England’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">e-learning for healthcare hub</a> and <a href="https://learninghub.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Learning Hub</a>
</li>
  <li>a pilot digital champion programme to support care workers to improve their basic digital skills, and give them the confidence to share what they have learnt with their peers and within their own organisations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p><abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr> should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engage with local authorities and care providers to consider their requirements for access to digital and technology solutions, using this information to develop a robust case to apply for the Digitising Social Care Fund as part of the <abbr title="Unified Tech Fund">UTF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>continue to support all care providers in their local area to access NHSmail, online collaboration tools and remote consultations for people receiving social care in all settings</li>
  <li>ensure care providers understand and are practising information governance when sharing health and care data between settings</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers are asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider how technical or digital solutions may help them to protect the people they support from COVID-19 or other respiratory infections, and connect them to their loved ones</li>
  <li>work with their service commissioner, if appropriate, and their ICS to develop a strong bid for funding from the Digitising Social Care Fund as part of the <abbr title="Unified Tech Fund">UTF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>review any inactive NHSmail accounts for their organisation, informing <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital’s service desk if they are no longer required so licences can be reallocated by emailing <a href="mailto:helpdesk@nhs.net" class="govuk-link">helpdesk@nhs.net</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Care homes are advised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engage with their ICS, feeding in their requirements, so that <abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr> can provide a high-quality business case for the Digitising Social Care Fund</li>
  <li>work with their regional leads to ensure they can access any scaling of remote monitoring that is being delivered in their locality</li>
  <li>work with NHSX and local partners to ensure they have an appropriate mobile device management system, and sufficient data to continue to be able to use iPads and meet <abbr title="Data Security and Protection Toolkit">DSPT</abbr> standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Safe discharge from <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> settings</h3>

<p>It is our priority to ensure that people are discharged safely from hospital to the most appropriate place, and that they receive the care and support they need.</p>

<p>Since March 2020, we have made nearly £3.3 billion available via the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to support enhanced discharge processes and the implementation of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hospital-discharge-service-guidance">discharge to assess model</a>. This approach means people who are clinically ready and no longer need to be in hospital are supported to return to their place of residence where possible.</p>

<p>Long-term social care needs assessments take place at a point of optimum recovery so that individuals have the long-term support they need. As per the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-framework-for-nhs-continuing-healthcare-and-nhs-funded-nursing-care">national framework for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care</a> and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reintroduction-of-nhs-continuing-healthcare" class="govuk-link">reintroduction of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare guidance</a>, issued in August 2020, which also aligns with the discharge to assess approach, screening and assessment for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> continuing healthcare and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>-funded nursing care should happen at the right time and location for the individual, and when the individual’s ongoing needs are known.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>As part of the above enhanced discharge funding, we have made £478 million available to continue hospital discharge programmes through the winter until March 2022. Funding will be provided for up to 4 weeks of post-discharge recovery and support services, for new and additional care needs during the second half of the year, for care delivered on or before 31 March 2022. The programme will not fund care delivered after 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>Any patient who has tested positive for coronavirus within the last 14 days should not be admitted to a care home.</p>

<p>This winter, we will continue the <a rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/news/stories/designated-settings-people-covid-19-leaving-hospital" class="govuk-link">designated settings scheme</a> to provide appropriate care for those infected with COVID-19 in a COVID-secure environment. The continuation over the winter will continue to support safe and timely discharge, and protect care home residents and staff from COVID-19.</p>

<p>We have provided £87 million specifically for discharge from mental health settings from April to December 2021 to help with recovery from COVID-19 and also potential pressures this winter.</p>

<p>Specialist and integrated care, support and accommodation improves health outcomes, reduces pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> and contributes to the government’s commitment to end rough sleeping by 2024. We have provided £16 million from January 2021 to end of March 2022 to help end the cycle of people leaving hospital, becoming homeless and then quickly being readmitted. This funding will enable us to draw out best practice models, which in turn will enable local areas to inform their own approaches to supporting this population.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p>While we expect demand for the settings to remain low, local authorities should continue to make decisions about the provisions of designated settings so that no local authority area is without a designated setting facility. Therefore, where current arrangements are working well to meet local demand for designated settings, local areas are encouraged to continue to deliver designated settings as they have been.</p>

<p>As set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-care-fund-policy-framework-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Better Care Fund">BCF</abbr> policy framework: 2021 to 2022</a>, areas should agree a joint plan to deliver health, social care, housing and other public services that work together to support improvements in outcomes for people being discharged from hospital, and the implementation of a ‘home first’ approach. Commissioners should ensure that a collaborative approach to commissioning the support for people being discharged from hospital makes the most effective use of social care capacity. Further details are set out in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/better-care-fund-planning-requirements-2021-22/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Better Care Fund">BCF</abbr> planning requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Local <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations and local authorities should work together to support discharge from mental health settings, such as to step down beds or longer-term supported housing, or with enhanced social care support in people’s homes (such as help with daily living activities like cooking and shopping or support with tenancies and other home adaptations).</p>

<p>Health and social care staff should always involve family and carers in discharge planning, and provide information and advice on who to contact if the individual’s condition changes, how their needs will be assessed and the follow-up support they will receive.</p>

<p>Upon admission to hospital, all people who are homeless or at risk should be identified and referred to local authority homelessness services as per the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hospital-discharge-service-policy-and-operating-model" class="govuk-link">hospital discharge and community support policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work with adult social care contract leads to identify capacity that can be used for hospital discharge purposes or follow-on care from reablement services</li>
  <li>work collaboratively with <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> primary and community care services</li>
  <li>follow the latest COVID-19 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-home-care">provision of home care</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19">supported living guidance</a> on managing discharges (as relevant)</li>
</ul>

<p>Care home providers should accept people discharged from hospital only when able to do so safely.</p>

<h3>Social prescribing</h3>

<p>Social prescribing has played an important role during the pandemic by supporting the health and wellbeing of individuals, carers and their communities, and will continue to do so over the upcoming winter. Social prescribing will continue to require close collaboration between the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> – including social prescribing link workers (<abbr title="social prescribing link workers">SPLW</abbr>), <abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr> teams, local authorities, and voluntary, community and social enterprise (<abbr title="voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr>) organisations – in order to ensure appropriate support is in place in line with local needs.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>Social prescribing services offer a wide range of support, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting people in regaining independence, tackling isolation and coping with the loss of support networks</li>
  <li>co-ordinating with health and social care colleagues</li>
  <li>offering a blend of virtual and face-to-face support and activities</li>
  <li>connecting people to a range of physical, nature-based and creative opportunities to stay physically active and mentally well, as well as to improve mobility, strength and balance where appropriate</li>
  <li>supporting local COVID-19 recovery plans and playing a key role in COVID-19 recovery, including supporting individuals on elective care waiting lists or those waiting for treatment to maintain their independence and wellbeing</li>
  <li>connecting people with financial and housing needs to local support organisations</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> implemented a rapid recruitment offer to support <abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> to recruit at least one <abbr title="social prescribing link workers">SPLW</abbr>. Over 400 new SPLWs were recruited between December 2020 and June 2021.</p>

<p>In line with the requirements of the network contract DES specification for 2021 to 2022, each <abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr> must ensure that individuals have access to a social prescribing service.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p>Local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work closely with SPLWs and <abbr title="voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr> organisations to co-ordinate support for people identified by health and care professionals as most needing support, especially those impacted by health inequalities, autistic people, people with learning disabilities, carers and those with dementia</li>
  <li>ensure SPLWs have the support and equipment to work remotely and access <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> or social care IT systems as needed</li>
  <li>ensure SPLWs have access to high-quality supervision and support</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should work closely with social prescribing services, including SPLWs and the <abbr title="voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr> sector, to co-ordinate support for people identified by health and care professionals as most needing it, especially those impacted by health inequalities.</p>

<h3>End-of-life care</h3>

<p>The opportunity to receive high-quality, personalised palliative and end-of-life care is of vital importance to individuals and those close to them. This should include meaningful, person-led discussions – if appropriate – that consider the person’s priorities, and physical, emotional and spiritual needs.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England have shared their palliative and end-of-life care delivery plan, which describes their focus on improving access, quality and sustainability in line with the <a href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan</a>. They have also set up a system of Palliative and End of Life Care Strategic Clinical Networks, which have clinical leadership as a key priority, working across boundaries of commissioning and provision as engines for change and reducing variation. Further information and guidance can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/eolc/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England website</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/renewing-our-ambitions-for-palliative-and-end-of-life-care/">The Ambitions for Palliative and End of Life Care: A national framework for local action</a> was refreshed and relaunched in May 2021.</p>

<p>Action is also being taken across health and care systems to ensure healthcare professionals understand the importance of delivering personalised approaches to care planning, advance decisions and care delivery, and that best practice guidance is available to support this in all care settings.</p>

<p>Following concerns raised about the inappropriate application of do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr>) decisions, we commissioned <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to review how <abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr> decisions were being made during the first wave of the pandemic. Their <a rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/news/releases/improved-oversight-reform-needed-pressures-pandemic-shine-light-inconsistent" class="govuk-link">Protect, respect, connect – decisions about living and dying well during COVID-19 report</a> was published in March 2021. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has established a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ministerial-oversight-group-on-do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-dnacpr-decisions">Ministerial Oversight Group on <abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr> decisions</a> that is responsible for the delivery and required changes of the recommendations in the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> report. We remain clear that it is unacceptable for <abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr> decisions to be applied in a blanket fashion to any group of people.</p>

<p>Public-facing information has now been published by <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>, which sets out what a <abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr> decision is, how it should be applied, who should be involved and what to do if an individual or their loved ones have concerns. This information can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-dnacpr-decisions/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England website</a>. The Resuscitation Council <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has also published updated <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.resus.org.uk/library/2021-resuscitation-guidelines">2021 resuscitation guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> will urgently raise cases of inappropriate use of <abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr>, as it becomes aware, with the relevant bodies, including the General Medical Council, and take action where registered providers are responsible.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations</h4>

<p>All organisations should put in place resources and support to ensure that, wherever practicable and safe, loved ones should be afforded the opportunity to be with a dying person, particularly in the last hours of life.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> organisations and local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that discussions and decisions on advance care planning, including end of life, take place between the individual (and those people who are important to them where appropriate) and the multidisciplinary care team supporting them. Where a person lacks the capacity to make treatment decisions, a care plan should be developed following, where applicable, the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/making-decisions-for-someone-else/mental-capacity-act/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">best interest checklist</a> under the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" class="govuk-link">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>.</li>
  <li>implement relevant guidance, and circulate, promote and summarise guidance to the relevant providers. This should draw on the wide range of resources that have been made available to the social care sector by health and care system partners and organisations, including those published by:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/eolc/resources/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr></a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Home.aspx" rel="external">Skills for Care</a></li>
      <li>the <a href="http://www.rcgp.org.uk/about-us/news/2020/april/joint-statement-on-advance-care-planning.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Royal College of General Practitioners</a>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow the above guidance in delivering personalised approaches to care, in all settings, including where care is being provided in an individual’s home</li>
  <li>ensure they make every effort, wherever practicable and safe, to enable a dying person to be with their loved ones, particularly in the last hours of life</li>
</ul>

<p>If a care provider is concerned about pressures to put in place DNACPRs, they should escalate, in the first instance, using their internal whistleblowing policies.</p>

<h2>Supporting the people who provide care</h2>

<h3>Unpaid carers and respite care</h3>

<p>We recognise the vital role all unpaid carers play, especially during this difficult period, and the demands the coronavirus pandemic has placed on those caring for relatives and their loved ones.</p>

<p>Day and respite services are an important form of support for people with care needs and their carers. Local authorities have a duty under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Care Act 2014</a> to provide or arrange services that meet the social care needs of the local population. Decisions around the closure, opening and delivery of day and respite services lie at local authority level, in line with local risk assessments and the latest public health advice.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-unpaid-care">guidance for those who provide unpaid care to family and friends during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, including young carers, and will continue to keep this guidance up to date to communicate any new advice, including safety measures, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, COVID-19 testing for carers and day services, and COVID-19 and flu vaccines. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-providing-unpaid-care-to-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults" class="govuk-link">guidance for those who provide unpaid care to adults with learning disabilities and autistic adults</a>
</li>
  <li>providing additional funding to local authorities through the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr> to support day and respite services, as well as working with the Social Care Institute for Excellence (<abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr>) to produce <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.scie.org.uk/care-providers/coronavirus-covid-19/day-care/safe-delivery" rel="external">guidance on delivering safe face-to-face day care</a> for local authority commissioners and providers</li>
  <li>continuing to consider and account for the needs of young carers and how they can best be supported this winter by developing approaches to support education recovery, such as through a review of time spent in school and college, and the impact this could have on helping children and young people to catch up</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure carers, and those who organise their own care, know what support is available to them and who to contact if they need help. Local authorities have a duty under the Care Act 2014 to provide or arrange services that meet the social care needs of the local population</li>
  <li>ensure that carers’ assessments are reviewed and updated to reflect any additional needs of both carers and those in need of social care</li>
  <li>continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-people-receiving-direct-payments" class="govuk-link">direct payments guidance</a>, ensuring that they take a flexible approach so that those receiving all forms of direct payments continue to have flexibility in how they receive their care and support</li>
  <li>continue to work with day and respite service providers to ensure the safe re-opening and extended opening of their services, where appropriate, and continue to support those who require services to ensure identified needs are met in the interim of some services re-opening</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All services are provided on the basis of need, and therefore all providers should be proactively considering how to meet those needs in a safe and secure way. We have worked with the <abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr> to publish <a rel="external" href="https://www.scie.org.uk/care-providers/coronavirus-covid-19/day-care/safe-delivery" class="govuk-link">guidance to help decisions on the safe continuation and re-opening of day services</a>.</p>

<h4>Supporting the workforce</h4>

<p>The social care workforce is a large and diverse group, with around 1.5 million people working across 38,000 settings. It includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal assistants</li>
  <li>self-employed carers</li>
  <li>paid care workers</li>
  <li>registered managers</li>
  <li>regulated professions, such as social workers and nurses</li>
  <li>staff in many ancillary roles</li>
</ul>

<p>The workforce have put in extraordinary effort over the course of the pandemic to keep the people they care for safe and well, and it is of central importance that we continue to support the workforce through this next period by keeping them well, increasing workforce capacity, and providing high-quality training and guidance.</p>

<p>Recruitment and retention across the adult social care workforce is a significant challenge. We recognise the ongoing hard work by providers and local authorities – working with system partners such as the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> – to address difficult workforce capacity issues.</p>

<p>The government will continue to work closely with the sector to monitor the situation over the winter period and to consider what further action may be necessary.</p>

<h3>Workforce wellbeing</h3>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We have made available to staff national resources and guidance, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-health-and-wellbeing-of-the-adult-social-care-workforce" class="govuk-link">guidance on health and wellbeing of the <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> workforce</a> providing advice on how staff can manage their personal mental health in light of the current pandemic. This also provides employers with guidance, tools and advice on how to take care of the wellbeing of staff at work.</p>

<p>The Chief Social Worker has, in partnership with the Tavistock and Portman <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Trust, issued <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Documents/Learning-and-development/social-work/psw/COVID-19-Guidance-for-Adult-Social-Care-Professionals-CSW.pdf" rel="external">guidance on the support and wellbeing of adult social workers and social care professionals</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mentalhealthatwork.org.uk/ourfrontline/" rel="external">Our Frontline</a>, a collaboration between Samaritans, Shout, Hospice <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and Mind, provides information, emotional support and access to a crisis text service. The Samaritans and Hospice <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> have also extended their support lines to provide support to social care staff.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Leadership-management/support-for-registered-managers/support-for-registered-managers.aspx" rel="external">package of support for registered managers</a> is available via Skills for Care, recognising that they are facing particular challenges. This includes a series of webinars and a dedicated advice line. Further wellbeing support is available from Skills for Care, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Leadership-management/managing-people/Wellbeing/Wellbeing.aspx" rel="external">wellbeing resource finder</a>.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/supporting-our-nhs-people/support-now/staff-mental-health-and-wellbeing-hubs/" class="govuk-link">Staff mental health and wellbeing hubs</a> have been set up to provide health and social care colleagues with rapid access to assessment and local evidence-based mental health services and support where needed. Hubs are confidential and free of charge for all health and social care staff.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain, where possible, the additional staff support services that they put in place during the first wave of the pandemic</li>
  <li>review current occupational health provision with providers in their area and highlight good practice</li>
  <li>promote wellbeing offers to their staff and allow staff time to access support, as well as promoting to providers in their area</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reinforce the message that staff mental health and wellbeing remains of the utmost priority. There are tips and advice on how employers can take care of the wellbeing of staff at work in the previously mentioned guidance</li>
  <li>investigate the provision of dedicated occupational health services for staff</li>
  <li>undertake a workplace risk assessment with a view to protecting the health, safety and welfare of all staff. Employers should have individual conversations about COVID-19 with all members of their workforce who may be at increased risk. A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-reducing-risk-in-adult-social-care/covid-19-adult-social-care-risk-reduction-framework" class="govuk-link">risk reduction framework for adult social care</a> has been published to provide employers with guidance on how to sensitively discuss and manage specific risks to their staff; this includes risk by ethnicity, but also age, sex and underlying health conditions. This guidance will be reviewed as new evidence emerges</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workforce capacity</h3>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We will provide £162.5 million through the workforce recruitment and retention fund to support local authorities and providers to recruit and retain sufficient staff over winter, and support growth in workforce capacity of the existing workforce, until 31 March 2022. This will be subject to conditions for local authorities ensuring it is used to address local workforce pressures.</p>

<p>We will continue with our national recruitment campaign across broadcast, digital and social media, highlighting the vital work care workers do. The next phase of the campaign started running from the end of October 2021.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/Monthly-spotlight/RecruitmentReady.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">RecruitmentReady recruitment guidance</a> for local authorities and employers have been published by Skills for Care, supported by the department.</p>

<p>Free and fast-track Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) checks, and the barred list service, remain in place for providers recruiting staff and volunteers to health and social care services in response to coronavirus. This is supported by <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/all-services/covid-19-interim-guidance-dbs-other-recruitment-checks">interim guidance on <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> and other recruitment checks</a> published by <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>.</p>

<p>We are continuing to offer free rapid online <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/COVID-19-Essential-training.aspx">induction and refresher training</a> through Skills for Care to induct and train redeployed staff, new starters, existing staff and new volunteers in social care services so that people can start work quickly or continue to access essential refresher training, including <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> awareness.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> funds the <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/care-and-health-improvement-programme-integration-support-offer-health-and-care-system" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Care and Health Improvement Programme (<abbr title="Care and Health Improvement Programme">CHIP</abbr>)</a>, which is jointly delivered by the Local Government Association (<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>) and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (<abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Social Services">ADASS</abbr>). One of the priority areas within that programme is workforce, with bespoke support provided to specific regions and local authorities to address workforce challenges. The programme also supports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all regions to have strategic workforce plans in place</li>
  <li>national and local recruitment drives</li>
  <li>improvement of staff retention and wellbeing</li>
  <li>the development of professional practice in social care</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect the introduction of vaccination requirements for care home workers from 11 November 2021, and the possible expansion to other social care settings (subject to consultation) to help address reductions in capacity that would otherwise arise due to staff becoming ill from the virus or needing to isolate, though we recognise the potential for staffing issues where affected care home workers chose to leave the sector. We are working with Skills for Care to ensure that resources such as <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Recruitment-retention/COVID-19/COVID-19-Vaccination.aspx" rel="external" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 vaccination guidance</a> and best practice are available to support providers and local authorities with capacity and workforce planning, recruitment and wellbeing.</p>

<p>This is in addition to where we have worked with Skills for Care to publish <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Learning-development/ongoing-learning-and-development/Delegated-healthcare-interventions/Delegated-healthcare-Interventions.aspx">guidance to support care staff, managers and employers with delegated healthcare tasks</a>. We will keep the support available to the sector with delivering delegated tasks under review and consider further actions where necessary.</p>

<p>Our regional assurance team will continue to work closely with local authorities to support their workforce planning and encourage robust contingency plans. The team also works with funded partners such as Skills for Care to provide guidance and support to local authorities on recruitment and retention issues, including disseminating best practice across the sector. The team, through its close engagement with local authorities, provides valuable intelligence on local workforce pressures to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and government.</p>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) will ensure that Jobcentre Work Coaches are equipped to effectively promote adult social care careers to jobseekers.</p>

<p>The legislative, vetting, regulatory, and pay and conditions frameworks have been put in place to ensure the temporary registration of returning regulated staff and students who have already registered can continue, and that they can contribute to capacity in the health and care workforce throughout the winter period. View the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/coronavirus/temporary-registration/" class="govuk-link">registers</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.socialworkengland.org.uk/registration/covid-19-temporary-registration/">list of social workers with temporary registration</a>.</p>

<p>Skills for Care have produced a range of case studies and information looking at initiatives that can be established within social care to support staffing resilience and workforce capacity. These include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Leadership-management/commissioning-and-planning-workforce/Meeting-and-supporting-winter-staffing-needs-202021.aspx" rel="external">staff banks, recruitment support and other initiatives to help boost staffing supply this winter</a>.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the workforce recruitment and retention funding to support local authorities and providers to recruit and retain sufficient staff over winter, and support growth in workforce capacity of the existing workforce. This will be subject to conditions that will be published shortly</li>
  <li>continue to work with local providers, partners and the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to take a whole-system approach to promoting careers in adult social care, and support retention of the existing workforce. This could include, for example, running local recruitment campaigns or administering shared wellbeing and occupational health schemes. As set out above, Skills for Care provide resources to help local authorities improve workforce capacity and resilience</li>
  <li>work with local providers and partners, including the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, to ensure they have robust contingency arrangements in place to help manage any staffing shortages through the winter. Contingency plans should set out how workforce capacity pressures will be monitored, what the contingency measures are and what their triggers will be, and which organisations are responsible for implementing them. Plans should describe the point at which the relevant <abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr> is notified of workforce capacity pressures, and where intervention from other partners may be required. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s regional assurance team will work with local and national partners to understand the current and potential risks to adult social care delivery and planned mitigations</li>
  <li>follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricting-workforce-movement-between-care-homes-and-other-care-settings">guidance on deploying staff and managing their movement</a>, and support providers in their area to access other initiatives using <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Leadership-management/commissioning-and-planning-workforce/Meeting-and-supporting-winter-staffing-needs-202021.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">best practice examples and case studies</a> of local authority workforce capacity measures, such as the Bringing Back Staff programme</li>
  <li>support providers in their area to update their <a href="https://asc-wds.skillsforcare.org.uk/login" rel="external" class="govuk-link">adult social care workforce data set (<abbr title="adult social care workforce data set">ASC-WDS</abbr>)</a> records, to help ensure effective local capacity monitoring and planning, and manage data requests to local providers to avoid duplication with the information already being provided through the <a href="https://capacitytracker.com/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Capacity Tracker</a> and <abbr title="adult social care workforce data set">ASC-WDS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>where appropriate, consider logistical support to care providers – such as help with cleaning, transport and maintenance – to free up frontline care staff</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access recruitment support to fill vacancies via the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-job">Find a Job service</a>, as well as using local recruitment methods. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.adultsocialcare.co.uk/home.aspx">Free recruitment campaign materials are available on our campaign website</a>. <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/top-tips-retention-briefing-adult-social-care-providers" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Top tips for retention</a> have also been developed with the Care Provider Alliance and published by the <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> and <abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Social Services">ADASS</abbr> Care and Health Improvement Programme (<abbr title="Care and Health Improvement Programme">CHIP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>review arrangements in place to ensure they have sufficient staff to provide safe high-quality care, even in the event of increased staff absence – for example, by using the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Leadership-management/commissioning-and-planning-workforce/Meeting-and-supporting-winter-staffing-needs-202021.aspx">Skills for Care’s case studies and examples</a>
</li>
  <li>continue to ensure staff receive normal wages while self-isolating in line with government guidance. The government has provided funding to support this through the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>ensure they complete the <a href="https://capacitytracker.com/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Capacity Tracker</a> and update their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://asc-wds.skillsforcare.org.uk/login" rel="external"><abbr title="adult social care workforce data set">ASC-WDS</abbr> records</a> to ensure effective data for planning for local, regional and national capacity issues</li>
</ul>

<h3>Social work and other professional leadership</h3>

<p>Our plan for the delivery of health and social care over winter will remain reliant on the ability of professionals in the sector to support people, ensuring delivery of the duties set out in the Care Act 2014 and maintaining good-quality practice. Social workers, occupational therapists, nurses and other professionals have specific statutory duties and professional responsibilities, and we recognise the pivotal role they will play in leading local response planning and the organisation of care to support people locally.</p>

<p>Social workers, nurses, occupational therapists and other professionals will work flexibly to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>address seasonal health and care challenges</li>
  <li>encourage and support people and their carers to access opportunities to have COVID-19 and flu vaccination</li>
  <li>ensure that care and support plans address <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> requirements</li>
</ul>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We will continue to support principal social workers (<abbr title="principal social workers">PSWs</abbr>) to lead social work teams at a local level, including hosting regular national webinars to address issues and risks as they arise.</p>

<p>We will offer continued support and resource to the <abbr title="principal social worker">PSW</abbr> networks, to ensure the availability of peer and bespoke support and interventions.</p>

<p>We are providing national leadership by the recent appointment (on 2 September 2021) of a permanent Chief Nurse for social care who will work alongside the Chief Social Worker for Adults to raise the profile of the social care nursing workforce, and provide professional leadership to the social care workforce and social care practice.</p>

<p>We are ensuring that the social work workforce has the right capabilities to carry out its roles safely, which includes commissioning Skills for Care to deliver development programmes for <abbr title="principal social workers">PSWs</abbr>, supervisor-level social workers, and both principal and lead occupational therapists. The Chief Nurse will promote the sector to registered nurses.</p>

<p>We are encouraging the collection and sharing of learning on a national level to identify and embed good practice by working with the National Institute for Health Research (<abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>) to influence research priorities on social work that deliver better outcomes for people.</p>

<p>We are working with other national professional bodies to ensure that their members have similar opportunities.</p>

<p>We will publish guidance for safeguarding professionals to encourage systemic change and a consistency in responding to safeguarding concerns.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p><abbr title="directors of adult social services">DASSs</abbr> and <abbr title="principal social workers">PSWs</abbr> should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that their social work teams are applying legislative and strengths-based frameworks, and support partner organisations such as the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> to do the same. See, for example, the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted" class="govuk-link">Care Act 2014</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>
</li>
  <li>continue to ensure social work practice is fully cognisant and acts on the issues of inequality and deprivation, and the impact this has on communities and people’s access to health and social care services</li>
  <li>ensure they understand and address health inequalities across the sector, and develop actions with partners, where required, considering the implications of the:
    <ul>
      <li>higher prevalence of COVID-19 in Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities</li>
      <li>inequalities experienced by people with learning disabilities, autistic adults, people with mental health difficulties and people who provide unpaid care</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>consider a review of their current quality assurance frameworks and governance oversight arrangements to ensure that winter and COVID-19 pressures do not reduce the ability to deliver high-quality practice</li>
  <li>develop and maintain links with professionals across the health and care system to ensure joined-up services</li>
  <li>lead local application of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ethical-framework-for-adult-social-care">ethical framework for adult social care</a>, ensuring that <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> partners fully understand their responsibilities to apply the ethical principles and values as part of discharge delivery</li>
  <li>ensure that the application of new models and pathways is offering the best possible outcome for individuals, their families and loved ones, advocating for them, and advising commissioners where these pathways cause a conflict</li>
  <li>review any systemic safeguarding concerns that have arisen during the pandemic period, and ensure actions are in place to respond to them, enabling readiness for any increased pressures over the winter period</li>
  <li>support and lead social workers and safeguarding teams to apply statutory safeguarding guidance with a focus on person-led and outcome-focused practice</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should continue to support regulated and qualified nurses, occupational therapists, social workers and other qualified staff that they employ by ensuring they are aware of professional duties, the latest guidance and training opportunities, and by supporting them to protect their wellbeing.</p>

<h2>Supporting the system</h2>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the government has provided almost £2.4 billion of grant funding to adult social care for <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>, testing and workforce capacity. This is in addition to over £6 billion in un-ringfenced grant funding made available to local authorities to enable them to address the pressures on local services caused by the pandemic, including in adult social care.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr> is currently supporting the implementation of infection control measures, including relevant recommendations from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-care-homes">care home support package</a>. We have extended the fund to ensure it continues to provide support through the winter to March 2022, making an additional £388.3 million of funding available to support providers. This will be subject to conditions for providers and local authorities that we will set out in full in due course.</p>

<p>Following closure of the Workforce Capacity Fund (<abbr title="Workforce Capacity Fund">WCF</abbr>) earlier this year, we will provide workforce recruitment and retention funding to support local authorities and providers to recruit and retain sufficient staff over winter 2021 to 2022, and support growth in workforce capacity of the existing workforce. This will be subject to conditions for local authorities to ensure it is used to address local workforce pressures. We have also published evidence from the <abbr title="Workforce Capacity Fund">WCF</abbr> which has been used to inform the design and planned implementation of the Workforce Recruitment and Retention Fund (<abbr title="Workforce Recruitment and Retention Fund">WRRF</abbr>).</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We have extended the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to support care home providers to follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricting-workforce-movement-between-care-homes-and-other-care-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance on restricting workforce movement between care homes and other care settings</a>
</li>
  <li>continue to support providers to pay staff who are isolating in line with government guidance their normal wages while doing so</li>
  <li>provide further support to other settings beyond care homes, such as home care and other community settings</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should continue to meet the conditions of the extended <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>, including ensuring providers in receipt of funding continue to complete the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://capacitytracker.com/">Capacity Tracker</a>, provide timely reports to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> on spending of the grant, and repay any unspent amounts by the deadline set out.</p>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide data through the <a href="https://capacitytracker.com/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Capacity Tracker</a>, or through other relevant data collection or escalation routes in line with government guidance and the conditions of the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>
</li>
  <li>implement <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures in line with government guidance</li>
  <li>provide information to local authorities about their spending supported by the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr> in line with the grant conditions, including repaying any unspent amounts to local authorities when requested to do so</li>
  <li>maintain robust financial records about their use of the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Market and provider sustainability</h3>

<p>Under the Care Act 2014, local authorities have duties to shape local provision of care and ensure services remain sustainable and continuity of care is maintained. Alongside this sits the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-providers/market-oversight-corporate-providers/market-oversight-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">Market Oversight scheme</a>, which monitors the financial health of the largest and most difficult-to-substitute providers, so that there is early warning of emerging risks.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has added to the cost and revenue pressures that care providers face, and we recognise the need to take steps to maintain the continuity of services. The exit from the market of providers within the scope of the Market Oversight entry criteria, as specified in legislation, requires national oversight and co-ordination because of the potentially high level of commercial complexity and the geographical spread of affected areas.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>We  are providing funding support and improvement work in the sector, including funding the <abbr title="Care and Health Improvement Programme">CHIP</abbr>, delivered by <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> and <abbr title="Association of Directors of Adult Social Services">ADASS</abbr>, to produce a suite of tools and support for local authorities to manage their markets, including responding to current pressures and managing the transition to new models of care.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> regional assurance team will work alongside <abbr title="Care and Health Improvement Programme">CHIP</abbr> to ensure the best possible understanding of local market challenges.</p>

<p>We are working with other government departments and the insurance industry to better understand the route towards the restoration of a fully functioning adult social care insurance market, where care providers can access a range of insurance products which meet their needs.</p>

<p>We have committed over £6 billion to local authorities since the start of the pandemic through un-ringfenced grants to address the pressures on local services caused by COVID-19, including adult social care. Local authorities are best placed to understand and plan the care and support needs of their local population, and therefore to decide how they can best use this funding. For example, some local authorities have used this funding to help providers manage the increased costs of insurance and compensate for lost income from temporary reductions in occupancy.</p>

<p>We introduced the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://resolution.nhs.uk/covid-19-and-business-continuity/claims-management/">Designated Settings Indemnity Support (<abbr title="Designated Settings Indemnity Support">DSIS</abbr>)</a> in January 2021 to provide temporary, state-backed indemnity cover for designated settings within the care home market that were unable to obtain sufficient insurance to accept COVID-19-positive patients on discharge from hospital. Following a review of <abbr title="Designated Settings Indemnity Support">DSIS</abbr>, the indemnity support has been extended to cover the winter period until 31 March 2022 to maintain the current level of support for these vital settings. <abbr title="Designated Settings Indemnity Support">DSIS</abbr> will be kept under review throughout this period and there will be no further extension to the indemnity support beyond this date.</p>

<p>We are continuing to work with the sector and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> to monitor the sustainability of providers within the sector, and to review actions that may be needed nationally and locally to reduce the risk of provider failure, as well as ensure continuity of care for service users and wider implications (such as for unpaid carers).</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to work to understand their local care market; and to support and develop the market accordingly including promoting financial support available</li>
  <li>continue to work to understand consumer demand and need, and where there are potential stresses in the market</li>
  <li>make full use of tools developed by the <abbr title="Care and Health Improvement Programme">CHIP</abbr> to identify, understand and assess risks in their local markets, and draw on <abbr title="Care and Health Improvement Programme">CHIP</abbr> support as needed</li>
  <li>continue to review and update contingency plans for managing service interruptions, including those that arise if a provider is unable to carry on because of business failure</li>
  <li>try to identify and communicate key issues affecting the industry and the market in their local area, and draw any concerns to the attention of regional and national <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> representatives</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers are asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leading into winter, review and update their business continuity plans, and proactively engage with relevant local authorities or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> commissioners and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> if they have concerns or need support</li>
  <li>consider their insurance arrangements and any associated risks as part of their business continuity planning. This should include engaging with their insurance providers and/or brokers well in advance of their renewal date. Further guidance on accessing employers’ and public liability insurance in the care sector is available to view on the <a href="https://www.abi.org.uk/globalassets/files/subject/public/care-homes/care-sector-steps-to-access-el-and-pl-cover.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Association of British Insurers website.</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>’s regulatory model</h3>

<p>During winter 2021 to 2022, <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> will continue to apply a risk-based approach to inspection, using information from a range of sources, including from people using services and their families, to shape their inspection activity, which will allow them to adapt and respond to the challenges that winter brings quickly.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> will (on regulation):</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to develop their monitoring approach to capture a broad range of information about a service, including from members of the public via their <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/give-feedback-on-care" class="govuk-link" rel="external">give feedback on care process</a>, and using this information to target regulatory activity where it is most needed</li>
  <li>continue to schedule inspections based on risk, where people may be at risk of harm or where a closed culture could develop, by focusing on high-risk providers where there are, for example, safeguarding concerns or where the provider has an overall rating of inadequate</li>
  <li>ensure that all inspections of care providers consider how well services are managing infection prevention and control, taking swift regulatory action where provider-level performance requires rapid improvement. This will include monitoring compliance with vaccinations as a condition of deployment within its inspection activity</li>
  <li>ensure that information about additional risks and pressures, including on staffing and visiting, are raised with national government and relevant system partners</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> will (on best practice) continue to collect examples of best practice, ensuring that they are shared with the sector either as a standalone publication or as part of <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>’s regular provider bulletins, as required.</p>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should continue to share information about registered services with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> and promote best practice.</p>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should proactively approach their local authority or <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> if they have concerns or need support.</p>

<h3>Local, regional and national oversight and support</h3>

<p>Throughout the pandemic, central and local government departments have continued to review local data from care providers, and work with health partners to address issues and review support to the care sector in places where data from COVID-19 testing shows increased rates of transmission.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will continue to use its regional assurance teams to disseminate best practice and provide support to local authorities, while highlighting emerging themes and delivery challenges to inform sector support.</p>

<p>Local authorities should also build on other existing resilience planning (for example, local outbreak plans and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cold-weather-plan-cwp-for-england">cold weather planning</a>). Planning should be as transparent and inclusive as possible, involving collaboration across health and care agencies, the voluntary sector, people who need care, and carers. Providers should also review and update their business continuity plans leading into winter.</p>

<h4>National support</h4>

<p>Over the following months, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue engagement with local authorities and providers, through the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> regional assurance teams, on winter contingency and business continuity planning, review key social care data through the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://capacitytracker.com/">Capacity Tracker</a> and other sources, and work to ensure that national, regional, and local data and information-gathering is consistent, effective and proportionate</li>
  <li>continue to develop the Adult Social Care Dashboard (which brings together data from multiple sources and allows it to be viewed in near-real time at national, regional and local levels by national and local government). This has allowed timely cross-sector action to be taken to manage and mitigate emerging risks and issues at all levels</li>
  <li>continue to publish monthly statistics on testing, vaccinations, and other relevant topics as part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monthly-statistics-for-adult-social-care-england" class="govuk-link">adult social care in England statistics</a>
</li>
  <li>continue with plans for the Client Level Data project to collect data from 2023 onwards that will allow consideration of waiting times, as we view this as the most appropriate route to collect such information with sufficient nuance</li>
  <li>continue to work with <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> and across the whole <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> sector to clarify data needs and collection guidance, for example <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://capacitytracker.com/">Capacity Tracker</a> and other regulated data collections</li>
  <li>incorporate some assurance of providers’ plans in their Corporate Provider and Market Oversight work, which covers approximately 30% of the adult social care market. <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> will identify whether winter plans exist and provide a high-level view on their suitability. They will not monitor their ongoing implementation but, when necessary, will report and escalate any significant concerns to system partners</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for local authorities</h4>

<p>Local authorities should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to engage with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> regional assurance teams and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> partners, where appropriate, on contingency planning</li>
  <li>continue current oversight processes, including delivery of care home support plans and engagement with regional feedback loops</li>
  <li>continue to champion the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://capacitytracker.com/">Capacity Tracker</a> and promote its importance as a source of data to local providers and commissioners</li>
  <li>establish a weekly joint communication from local <abbr title="directors of adult social services">DASSs</abbr> and <abbr title="directors of public health">DPHs</abbr> to go to all local providers of adult social care, as a matter of course, through the winter months</li>
</ul>

<h4>Actions for providers</h4>

<p>All care providers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review and update their business continuity plans leading into winter, and proactively engage with the relevant local authorities or <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> commissioners and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> if they have concerns or need support</li>
  <li>
    <p>continue to complete the relevant sections of the <a rel="external" href="https://capacitytracker.com/" class="govuk-link">Capacity Tracker</a></p>

      <td>As a part of stage 2, the efficacy of the workforce measures put in place should be further reviewed to more clearly identify which individual interventions were effective. This is to inform the decisions about what measures should be continued or introduced, and the resources that would need to be available for the forthcoming winter.</td>
      <td>Following closure of the £120 million <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workforce-capacity-fund-for-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">Workforce Capacity Fund (<abbr title="Workforce Capacity Fund">WCF</abbr>)</a>, we conducted a process evaluation to explore its design and use. This includes exploring local authorities’ perceptions of the impact of activities funded by the <abbr title="Workforce Capacity Fund">WCF</abbr> on workforce capacity, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by local authorities and care providers. The data used comes from monitoring information, workshops with stakeholders, a survey of local authorities and other feedback by the sector. Some of the learning from this evaluation has now been published and has helped identify the strengths and barriers to inform the design and implementation of the <abbr title="Workforce Recruitment and Retention Fund">WRRF</abbr>. <br>   <br> During winter 2020 to 2021, we launched a national recruitment campaign to drive recruitment into the sector. We will be taking lessons learnt from the previous campaign forward into the design of our upcoming recruitment campaign this autumn and winter.  <br>  <br> In February 2021, we launched a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-urged-to-consider-work-in-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">national call to care</a> to encourage people to consider short-term paid opportunities to work in the adult social care sector. While it is difficult to assess how many recruits joined the sector as a result, the campaign secured over 3,500 expressions of interest, resulting in a number of recruitment leads being passed on to local authorities and providers.  <br>  <br> We keep all guidance under review to assess opportunities to ease or lift any of the guidance we make to the sector regarding workforce measures. This includes assessing how the current measures, along with any potential changes, affect the support that we need to provide the sector to support implementation of any <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures. Owing to the complex nature of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>, it is difficult to ascertain the impact of each component part. However, based on SAGE’s review of the measures, the cumulative effect has been beneficial in terms of minimising the spread of infection, thereby minimising outbreaks in care settings.</td>

      <td>Identify the specific risks to workforce capacity, supply and quality over the coming year, and develop and implement workforce contingency arrangements to reduce the risks and help to ensure workforce supply and safe working practices. The findings of this process should be further considered in the broader work on reform.</td>
      <td>We recognise that the sector is facing significant recruitment and retention challenges. We continue to monitor workforce capacity, supply and quality in the adult social care sector, bringing together available data with frontline intelligence from the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s regional assurance team and the sector. We are engaging with the sector regularly to understand capacity concerns and what is driving any challenges. <br>  <br> The government’s adult social care: coronavirus (COVID-19) winter plan 2021 to 2022 sets out the actions that government, local authorities and providers should take to address workforce capacity risks over the coming months. This includes providing a further £162.5 million workforce recruitment and retention funding to local authorities to support them to manage recruitment and retention in their area. We will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if appropriate. <br>  <br> In September 2021, the government announced a historic investment in the adult social care workforce in recognition of the vital role it plays in delivering high-quality care. We will invest at least £500 million across 3 years to deliver new qualifications, progression pathways, and wellbeing and mental health support. We anticipate this will help to ensure continued workforce supply in the future. We will work with the sector to co-develop more detail on our workforce reform plans and publish further detail in a white paper for adult social care reform later this year.</td>

The number of substantiated cases was extremely low, and all confirmed cases were referred through local authority safeguarding processes. <br>   <br> While information was not routinely collected on the reasons why people who were COVID-19 positive continued to work, we understand that a significant factor was acute staff shortage, where there were limited alternative options to safely staff care homes. <br>   <br> <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> have been clear that COVID-19-positive working is not acceptable in any circumstance. Since our joint publication on this matter in January 2021, <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> has received no new notifications or allegations of any cases that occurred after December 2020. <br>   <br> The department’s position remains that COVID-19-positive working is not acceptable in any circumstance, and local authorities should ensure any confirmed cases of COVID-19 positive working are considered through local safeguarding processes, including referring to the police if appropriate. <br>   <br> The government’s adult social care: coronavirus (COVID-19) winter plan 2021 to 2022 sets out the actions that the government is taking to address workforce capacity risks over the coming months. These include the <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>, which providers are able to use to pay for a number of measures, including ensuring that staff who are isolating in line with government guidance receive their normal wages and do not lose income while doing so. Throughout the pandemic, we have made available almost £2.4 billion in specific funding for adult social care. This is made up of £1.75 billion for infection prevention and control, £522 million for testing and £120 million to support workforce capacity.</td>
