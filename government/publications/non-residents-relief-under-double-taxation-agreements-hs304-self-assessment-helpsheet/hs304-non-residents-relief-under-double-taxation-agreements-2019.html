<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You can claim part or full relief from UK tax on your UK income if you’re a non-resident and the country you live in has a double taxation agreement (<abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr>) with the UK.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> is an agreement between 2 countries. It’s there to make sure you do not pay tax twice on the same income.</p>

<p>To find out if you’re a resident in the UK or not read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rdr3-statutory-residence-test-srt">Guidance note for statutory residence test (RDR3)</a>.</p>

<p>Check if your country has a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/double-taxation-treaties-territory-residents-with-uk-income"><abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can claim relief on the following types of income:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interest from bank and building societies</li>
  <li>royalties</li>
  <li>most work pensions</li>
  <li>annuities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of relief</h2>

<h3>Full relief</h3>

<p>You can claim full relief to get back all of the UK tax you pay on your UK income. You may have to pay tax on the income to the country you live in, depending on its <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK.</p>

<h3>Partial relief</h3>

<p>You can claim partial relief to get back some of the UK tax you pay on your UK income. For example, if the UK’s basic rate is 20% and your country’s <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK is 15%, you can claim 5% relief.</p>

<h3>Credit relief</h3>

<p>You can claim credit relief if your income is taxable in both the UK and the country you live in. Your country of residence will give you credit for the tax you’ve paid on your UK income, against its own tax. You need to make a claim to credit relief from the country in which you live.</p>

<h3>Other types of relief</h3>

<p>Your country’s <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr>  with the UK may have other conditions that you need to meet to claim UK tax relief. For example, it may say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have to be the ‘beneficial owner’ of the income - this means the income is not in your name but you enjoy the benefits of it</li>
  <li>your income has to be ‘subject to tax’ - this means it’s taxable in the country you live in, whether it’s for all your income or just the amount you get in your country</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you claim relief from UK tax, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check all the terms of the <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> that affects you</li>
  <li>collect enough evidence to show that you meet its conditions</li>
  <li>keep the evidence - you may need it to support your claim</li>
</ul>

<h2>Certificate of overseas residence</h2>

<p>You’ll need this certificate if you want to claim relief from UK tax on your UK income, and the country you live in has a <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK. To get one, contact your country’s tax authority.</p>

<p>The certificate of overseas residence must show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you pay taxes in the country you live in on all or part of the income you’re claiming relief for</li>
  <li>the amount of income you’ve paid tax on in that country</li>
</ul>

<p>You must attach the certificate to your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-residents-relief-under-double-taxation-agreements-hs304-self-assessment-helpsheet">claim form</a> and send it in with your tax return.</p>

<h3>United States of America</h3>

<p>The US taxes its residents on their worldwide income, wherever they live, so if you live in the US, you do not need a certificate of overseas residence.</p>

<p>You’re a US resident if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a substantial presence, permanent home or habitual abode in the US</li>
  <li>no country other than the UK treats you as a resident</li>
</ul>

<h3>Substantial presence test</h3>

<p>This shows how often you’re in the US over a certain period. You’ll have a substantial presence if you’re in the US for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 31 days of the calendar year in question</li>
  <li>the year in question and the 2 years before that and all 3 years add up to at least 183 days</li>
</ul>

<p>If you spend part of a day in the US, count it as a whole day.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the example below, a day spent in the US in the following year under test, counts as one-third, and a day in the year before that counts as one-sixth.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Geetha spends 48 days in the US in 2017, 250 days in 2016 and 365 days in 2015.</p>

<p>A day spent in the US in 2016 and 2015, counts as one-third and one-sixth respectively. In 2017, the calculation is:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Year</th>
      <th scope="col">Calculation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2017</td>
      <td>48 days × one  =  48</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2016</td>
      <td>250 days × one-third  =   84</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2015</td>
      <td>365 days × one-sixth  =   61</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>193</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>Geetha passes both parts of the substantial presence test. She’s a resident in the US, under the country’s domestic law.</p>

<h2>How to claim relief</h2>

<p>You need to keep all your original vouchers (not photocopies), showing the amount of UK tax or tax credit to support your claim.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>UK Real Estate Investment Trusts (<abbr title="UK Real Estate Investment Trusts">UK-REITs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>You may be able to claim relief if you get a property income dividend and you live in a country that has a <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK.
