<span class="number">1. </span> Pension scheme migration</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Take action now to migrate your pension schemes to the Managing Pension Schemes service.</p>
</div>

<p>Pension scheme administrators can now migrate pension schemes registered on the Pension schemes online service to the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/migrating-your-pension-scheme-to-the-managing-pension-schemes-service">Scheme administrators must be enrolled</a> on the Managing pension schemes service using their existing âA0â administrator ID to be able to migrate pension schemes. Administrators with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/migrating-your-pension-scheme-to-the-managing-pension-schemes-service">multiple scheme administrator IDs</a> will need to have enrolled on the Managing pension schemes service using their âmasterâ ID.</p>

<p>Only schemes with a status of âopenâ on the Pension schemes online service will be included in the list of schemes available to migrate. If youâve completed the process of setting up your âmasterâ and âancillaryâ scheme administrators IDs, youâll be able to migrate all open pension schemes under all of these IDs on the Managing pension schemes service, using your âmasterâ ID.</p>

<p>Weâll also be introducing additional features to the Managing pension schemes service to help pension scheme administrators and practitioners manage their pension schemes. These features are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bulk reporting for Accounting for Tax returns</li>
  <li>updated financial information</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to issues with testing, these features will not be available from today. We hope to release these shortly.</p>

<p>If youâd like us to contact you when these features are available, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk">migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk</a> and put âMPS â new featuresâ in the subject line.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1a. </span> Updated guidance</h3>

<p>Weâve updated our guidance on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/migrating-your-pension-scheme-to-the-managing-pension-schemes-service">prepare to migrate your pension schemes</a> to the Manging pension schemes service. 
As youâll still need to use the Pension schemes online service for certain reports weâve also updated our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pension-administrators">other guidance pages</a> to reflect how you should both services.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1b. </span> Migrating your pension schemes</h3>

<p>Scheme administrators can now select pension schemes from the list on the Managing pension schemes service, and provide up to date information on them, to migrate them to the service.</p>

<p>Before you migrate any pension schemes, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/migrating-your-pension-scheme-to-the-managing-pension-schemes-service">review the list of your registered schemes on the Pension schemes online service</a> and notify us if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can see schemes that are inactive and should be wound up</li>
  <li>can see schemes that you do not recognise</li>
  <li>cannot see listed all the  schemes you have registered on the Pension schemes online service</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="link%20to%20Appendix%20A%20of%20the%20newsletter">Appendix A</a>, you can find all the information that youâll need to complete to migrate a pension scheme. This information will need to be completed for each scheme that you need to migrate. Some fields may be pre-populated with information held on the Pension schemes online service and you may have the option to update some of this information as part of the migration process.</p>

<p>All the details entered must reflect the current position of the pension scheme.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about providing establisher details for a registered pension scheme for migration, for example if your scheme is a self-invested personal pension scheme, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk">migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk</a> with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pension scheme name</li>
  <li>your pension scheme tax reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>your scheme administrator ID</li>
  <li>details of the pension scheme establisher query</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are multiple scheme administrators listed for a pension scheme on the Pension schemes online service, any of these administrators will be able to complete the additional information as long as theyâre using their âmasterâ ID. If a scheme administrator starts entering scheme details, they can save their progress and it will be available for another scheme administrator to continue.</p>

<p>Once this information has been completed, the pension scheme will be migrated to the Managing pension schemes service under your âmasterâ ID. The scheme will then be removed from the list of schemes available to migrate from the Pension schemes online service and youâll receive a registration certificate by post, containing the schemeâs <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> and original date of registration.</p>

<p>The scheme will still exist on the Pension schemes online service after itâs been migrated.</p>

<p>You do not need to migrate all your pension schemes at once.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1c. </span> Migrating your retirement annuity contracts and deferred annuity contracts</h3>

<p>For retirement annuity contracts (<abbr title="referred annuity contracts">RACs</abbr>) and deferred annuity contracts (<abbr title="deferred annuity contracts">DACs</abbr>), no further information will be requested. Youâll only need to complete the declarations on the Managing pension schemes service to migrate these pension schemes.</p>

<p>If youâre a scheme administrator for multiple <abbr title="referred annuity contracts">RACs</abbr> and <abbr title="deferred annuity contracts">DACs</abbr>, youâll be given the option to migrate these altogether, by completing one set of declarations. If you are using this feature, it can take up to 48 hours for the <abbr title="referred annuity contracts">RACs</abbr> and <abbr title="deferred annuity contracts">DACs</abbr> to be added to your list of schemes on the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<p>If youâre migrating a large number of <abbr title="referred annuity contracts">RACs</abbr> or <abbr title="deferred annuity contracts">DACs</abbr>, and the migration of any scheme fails, it will reappear  in the list of <abbr title="referred annuity contracts">RACs</abbr> and <abbr title="deferred annuity contracts">DACs</abbr> available to migrate from the Pension schemes online service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Recreation of existing relationships</h2>

<p>Any other scheme administrators added to the pension scheme, or authorised practitioners, on the Pension schemes online service <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/migrating-your-pension-scheme-to-the-managing-pension-schemes-service">need to be enrolled</a> on the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<p>If theyâve enrolled for the Managing pension schemes service, their relationship with the scheme will automatically be recreated when the pension scheme is migrated.</p>

<p>If other scheme administrators added to the pension scheme enrol on the Managing pension schemes service after the scheme has been migrated, the relationship will be recreated at that point.</p>

<p>When practitioners enrol, their authorising scheme administrators must have enrolled before the relationship with the scheme can be recreated on the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Adding new scheme administrators or authorising new practitioners</h2>

<p>If you need to add new scheme administrators, or authorise new practitioners after the pension scheme has migrated, youâll need to do this on both the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pension-schemes-online-user-guide">Pension schemes online service</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-a-registered-pension-scheme">Managing pension schemes service</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Pension scheme practitioners</h2>

<p>Only scheme administrators can migrate pension schemes.</p>

<p>If youâre a pension scheme practitioner who would normally file Accounting for Tax returns on behalf of a scheme administrator, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-pension-scheme-practitioner">youâll need to be enrolled</a> on the Managing pension schemes service before you can do this.</p>

<p>Your authorising scheme administrator will need to be enrolled on the Managing pension schemes service. Once your authorising scheme administrator has enrolled and the pension scheme has been migrated, as long as youâre enrolled, youâll automatically be authorised to the pension scheme.</p>

<p>If you no longer act on behalf of a scheme administrator for a migrated pension scheme  youâll need to de-authorise yourself as a practitioner from the scheme on both the Pension schemes online service and the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Pension scheme reporting</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Accounting for Tax (<abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr>) returns</h3>

<p>You can no longer compile and submit any new <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> returns for any quarter from 1 April 2020 onwards, on the Pension schemes online service.</p>

<p>This means that if you need to submit any new <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> returns for any quarter starting 1 April 2020 onwards, youâll need to migrate the pension scheme and submit the return on the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>If you need to submit a return for the quarter 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022, you must migrate your pension scheme in time to compile and submit the return by the filing deadline of 15 May 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>If you think this will cause issues for you, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk">migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk</a> using â31 March 2022 <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr>â in the subject line. Weâll then contact you to discuss this further.</p>

<p>Find information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/submit-an-accounting-for-tax-aft-return-using-the-managing-pensions-schemes-service">how to submit an <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> return using the Managing pension schemes service</a>.</p>

<p>If youâve compiled, but not yet submitted, a new return on the Pension schemes online service for any quarter from 1 April 2020, you wonât be able to submit it on that service. If you try to, youâll receive an error message explaining that youâll need to re-compile and submit the return on the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<p>If you find that an <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> return should have been submitted for a quarter prior to 1 April 2020, you can submit that <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> return on the Pension schemes online service.</p>

<p>If youâve already submitted an <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> return on the Pension schemes online service for any period up to 31 December 2021, youâll still be able to view and amend them on the Pension schemes online service as normal.</p>

<p>You can no longer successfully submit any <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> returns for any period using third party software on the Pension schemes online service. Youâll need to compile and submit the return directly on the relevant service as explained in sub-section â5.1 Accounting for Tax Returnsâ.</p>

<p>If you try to submit a return using third party software, youâll receive an error message signposting you to guidance on how to submit the return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Pension Scheme Return</h3>

<p>For pension schemes with a Pension Scheme Tax Reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>) beginning with â0â, youâll continue to submit Pension Scheme Returns (if required) on the Pension schemes online service.</p>

<p>You only need to submit a Pension Scheme Return if youâve received a Notice to File for your pension scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Event reporting</h3>

<p>For pension schemes with a <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> beginning with â0â, youâll continue to submit event reports on the Pension schemes online service.</p>

<p>If youâve migrated the scheme you are submitting the event report for, youâll also need to email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pensions.businessdelivery@hmrc.gov.uk">pensions.businessdelivery@hmrc.gov.uk</a> and put âMPS event reportâ in the subject line if youâve reported any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>event 10</li>
  <li>event 11</li>
  <li>event 12</li>
  <li>event 13</li>
  <li>event 14</li>
  <li>event 19</li>
  <li>event 20</li>
  <li>winding up of the pension scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>In your email, youâll need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pension scheme tax reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the name of the pension scheme</li>
  <li>your pension scheme administrator ID</li>
  <li>details of the event type that youâve reported on the Pension schemes online service</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Bulk reporting for Accounting for Tax returns</h2>

<p>When this feature becomes available on the Managing pensions scheme service, youâll be able to choose to upload a file directly on to the service to populate an <abbr title="Accounting for Tax  returns">AFT</abbr> return.</p>

<p>The function will be available for uploading the details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Annual Allowance charges</li>
  <li>Lifetime Allowance charges</li>
  <li>Overseas Transfer charges</li>
</ul>

<p>For all other charges, youâll need to enter the details manually.</p>

<p>Youâll need to upload a different file for each charge. If more than one file is uploaded for the same charge whilst compiling your return, the original file will be overwritten.</p>

<p>All files will need to be uploaded as CSV files. The CSV file templates and instructions are available on the service.</p>

<p>You can manually add more entries for the same charge type after youâve uploaded a file for a particular charge. You cannot manually enter members details first and then upload a file, as the manual entries will be overwritten for that charge type.</p>

<p>Itâs only possible to upload a file for a specific charge once, in any quarter. For any subsequent amendments to that charge on the return, youâll only have the option to manually enter the data, directly on to the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<p>Example 1: If you reported a Lifetime Allowance charge on the first submission of the event report for a quarter, manually or by uploading a file, any subsequent amendments will need to be done manually.</p>

<p>Example 2 : If you did not report a Lifetime Allowance charge in the first submission of the event report for a quarter, you could bulk upload a file to report a Lifetime Allowance charge in the second submission for that quarter.</p>

<p>If thereâs a validation error with the file youâve uploaded, a message will be displayed explaining what the problem is and how to rectify this. Youâll need to correct any errors and upload the file again before you can submit the return.</p>

<p>The maximum file size is 2MB for any of the charges. There is no limit on the number of individuals you can include on the file, as long as the file size is no bigger than 2MB.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Payments relating to charges</h2>

<p>For a short period of time, youâll be unable to make a payment for a charge using the Pension Scheme Tax Reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>) as the reference.</p>

<p>If you need to make a payment, you must use the relevant charge reference so that your payment is allocated correctly.</p>

<p>If you do not know what the correct charge reference is, you should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pensions.administration@hmrc.gov.uk">pensions.administration@hmrc.gov.uk</a> and put âunknown charge referenceâ in the subject line of the email.</p>

<p>Weâll confirm when you can start making payments using the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> as the reference in a future newsletter.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Financial Information</h2>

<p>When we release the updated financial information available on the Managing pension schemes service, it will include information about payments made, where theyâve been allocated and your overall account balance.</p>

<p>Where there is an overall credit balance displayed on the record, pension scheme administrators and practitioners will have the option of requesting a refund through the service.</p>

<p>Once youâve requested a refund, the credit balance will only change once the refund has been made. Weâll aim to process your request within 15 working days. Youâll be able to see when the refund has been made as the credit balance will be reduced accordingly . Youâll also receive confirmation of the refund, and any repayment interest, by post.</p>

<p>Find information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pension-schemes-refund-or-reallocation-request">how to request a refund through the Managing pension schemes service</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Updating details</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9a. </span> Updating scheme information</h3>

<p>Once a pension scheme has been migrated to the Managing pension schemes service, youâll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-a-registered-pension-scheme">update your scheme information on the Pension schemes online service</a> and the Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9b. </span> Updating your details</h3>

<p>If youâre enrolled on the Managing pension schemes service, youâll need to keep your scheme administrator and practitioner details, up to date on both the Pension schemes online service and Managing pension schemes service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Schemes without a Pension Scheme Tax Reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Some pension scheme administrators do not currently have access to a number of pension schemes that were registered before 6 April 2006.</p>

<p>For many of these schemes, you may only hold the superannuation fund (SF) reference number, rather than a <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>.</p>

<p>If youâre a scheme administrator for a pension scheme that you do not currently have access to, youâll need to tell us that youâre the scheme administrator, to make sure that the pension scheme appears on your list of pension schemes available to migrate.</p>

<h3>If you have 5 or less of these pension schemes</h3>

<p>If you have 5 or less of these pension schemes, complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-pension-schemes-service-newsletter-march-2021">Appendix D of the March 2021 newsletter</a> and email this to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk">migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk</a> and put âPre-A Day pension schemesâ in the subject line.</p>

<h3>If you have more than 5 of these pension schemes</h3>

<p>If you have more than 5 of these pension schemes, send an email with âMultiple Pre-A Day schemesâ in the subject line, to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk">migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk</a>. Weâll provide further instructions on how to tell us about these pension schemes.</p>

<h3>Inactive pension schemes</h3>

<p>If youâre a scheme administrator for a pension scheme that you do not currently have access to, but the scheme is inactive and should be wound up, youâll need to send an email with âManaging pension schemes â wound up schemesâ in the subject line to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk">migration.mps@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>In your email, youâll need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> or superannuation fund reference number (if held)</li>
  <li>the name of the pension scheme</li>
  <li>your scheme administrator ID</li>
  <li>the date of wind up</li>
</ul>
