<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Cyber Runway: ‘Launch’ open for applications</h2>

<p>The ‘Launch’ strand of Cyber Runway, the DCMS-funded accelerator for UK cyber companies, is now open for applications.</p>

<p>Designed for early stage entrepreneurs and cyber businesses, Launch&nbsp; will be delivered as a one-week bootcamp, running from 27 June to 1 July. Over the course of the programme you will learn skills, gain connections and develop your idea so that you can grow your business into a successful cyber company.&nbsp;&nbsp;All companies and individuals are welcome&nbsp;and we are particularly encouraging businesses led by women and people from ethnic minorities to apply.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=13cd12cc98&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">apply online</a> and the deadline for applications is Wednesday 25 May.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>UK Cyber Security Council to oversee Cyber Certified Professional scheme</h2>

<p>The UK Cyber Security Council has announced that it will take over responsibility of running the cyber security industry’s Cyber Certified Professional scheme&nbsp; from the National Cyber Security Centre.</p>

<p>The Council will be conducting a review of the scheme, including through a pilot programme to ensure that the professional standards are fit for purpose. This will result in a tiered pathway into and through the profession, with quality professionals being recognised as Chartered Cyber Security Professionals.</p>

<p>The Council is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=845e3a3506&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">inviting expressions of interest from organisations and businesses across the sector</a> that would like to be involved in the pilot scheme. Those taking part will have the opportunity to help shape the development of the new chartered standards and qualifications the Council will be introducing.&nbsp;As the voice of the profession, the Council is keen to hear thoughts and observations from across the cyber security community in the UK.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>New research on enterprise connected devices</h2>

<p>DCMS has published&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=0885bc12f8&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">new research on “enterprise connected devices”</a>&nbsp;- devices used by organisations, such as office printers, office cameras, entry systems and room booking systems. There are significant concerns about the security of these&nbsp;commonly-used products,&nbsp;with vulnerable devices potentially&nbsp;providing a route for hostile actors to attack enterprise systems.</p>

<p>The research sets out some key findings, including how vulnerabilities in enterprise connected devices are putting large numbers of organisations at risk, whilst organisations lack clarity on how to monitor and protect themselves from vulnerable connected devices. Also published alongside this research is a National Cyber Security Centre&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=0ef879e12d&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">threat assessment on the organisational use of enterprise connected devices</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Only a few weeks left to see the free&nbsp;’Top Secret’ exhibition in Bradford</h2>

<p>There’s only a few weeks left to discover the fascinating world of code-breaking, cyber security and secret communications at the free, DCMS-funded exhibition,&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=d36bb250dc&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Top Secret: from cyphers to cyber security</a>. Hosted at the Science and Media Museum&nbsp;in Bradford, the exhibition has been created alongside experts from the UK’s intelligence, security and cyber agency, GCHQ, and runs until Sunday 5 June. It offers&nbsp;over a century’s worth of communications intelligence through handwritten documents, declassified files and incredible artefacts from GCHQ’s and the Science Museum Group’s historic collections,&nbsp;as well as family workshops, cyber skills events and an&nbsp;interactive puzzle zone.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=eb0cd3a57f&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Visit the Science and Media Museum website for your free tickets</a>.</p>
