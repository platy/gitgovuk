<p>This guidance is applicable in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>For Wales, it is important that this guidance is used in conjunction with the Welsh Government guidance on infection prevention and control measures at the time of assessment. Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" rel="external">GOV.WALES</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This advice is for you if you are pregnant and working as an employee. This includes pregnant healthcare professionals. It will help you discuss with your line manager and occupational health team how best to ensure health and safety in the workplace.</p>

<p>If you are pregnant and have let your employer know in writing of your pregnancy, your employer should carry out a risk assessment to follow the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/contents/made#:~:text=%20The%20Management%20of%20Health%20and%20Safety%20at,in%20host%20employers%27%20or%20self-employed%20persons%27...%20More%20" class="govuk-link">Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999</a> or the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2000/388/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000</a>. This may involve obtaining advice from the occupational health department. See the workplace risk assessment <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/covid19/health-safety-and-wellbeing/risk-assessments-for-staff" rel="external">guidance for healthcare workers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" rel="external">for vulnerable people working in other industries</a>.</p>

<p>Information contained in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/">RCOG/RCM guidance on coronavirus (COVID-19) in pregnancy</a> should be used as the basis for a risk assessment.</p>

<p>Pregnant women of any gestation should not be required to continue working if this is not supported by the risk assessment. Pregnant women require special consideration as contained in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm">government guides for different industries</a>.</p>

<h2>What has changed</h2>
<p>In the UK, most COVID-19 legal restrictions have now ended, including removing social distancing and social contact restrictions.</p>

<p>In Wales, the legal requirements have been replaced with guidance advising on key protective behaviours that can help minimise exposure to and spread of coronavirus. See <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/alert-level-0-guidance-public-html" class="govuk-link">GOV.WALES</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The rules on self-isolating as a contact have also changed for people who are fully vaccinated, and for under 18s. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance on the management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings</a>.</p>

<p>On 15 September 2021, the government announced that in England people considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable, including women who are pregnant with significant congenital or acquired heart disease, would not be advised to shield again and no further names will be added to the Shielded Patient List in England. The closure of the shielding programme followed a pause to shielding guidance in place since 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>In Scotland, women who are pregnant with significant congenital or acquired heart disease continue to be on the Scottish Government’s Highest Risk List. People on the Highest Risk List have been advised to follow the same measures and guidance as the rest of the population, including on going into the workplace. Further information is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-highest-risk/pages/workplace-safety-advice/?utm_source=redirect&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=highest-risk-work-safety" class="govuk-link">Scottish Government website</a>.</p>

<p>Please visit <a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/guidance-protecting-people-defined-medical-grounds-clinically-extremely-vulnerable-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">Public Health Wales</a>&nbsp;for any separate arrangements.</p>

<h2>Vaccination</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-women-of-childbearing-age-currently-pregnant-planning-a-pregnancy-or-breastfeeding/covid-19-vaccination-a-guide-for-women-of-childbearing-age-pregnant-planning-a-pregnancy-or-breastfeeding">COVID-19 vaccines are recommended in pregnancy</a>. Women who are pregnant should be offered their COVID-19 vaccination at the same time as non-pregnant women, based on their age and clinical risk group, in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) advice.</p>

<p>Vaccination is the best way to protect against the known risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy for both women and babies, including admission of the woman to intensive care and premature birth of the baby. The vaccine is considered to be safe and effective at any stage of pregnancy. Women who find out they are pregnant after their first dose do not need to delay their second dose. You’ll need to book a second dose for 8 to 12 weeks after your first dose.</p>

<p>Pregnant women may wish to discuss the benefits and risks of having the vaccine with their healthcare professional and reach a joint decision based on individual circumstances. However, as for the non-pregnant population, pregnant women can receive a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have not had a discussion with a healthcare professional.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/" class="govuk-link">Eligible pregnant women will be offered a COVID-19 booster jab</a> 6 months after their second vaccine, this includes health and social care workers and those with underlying health conditions.</p>

<p>Having a COVID-19 vaccine will not remove the requirement for employers to carry out a risk assessment for pregnant employees, which should follow the rules set out in&nbsp;this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees" class="govuk-link">government guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>The following recommendations apply for  pregnant women at any gestation who are vaccinated</h3>

<p>You must first have a workplace risk assessment with your employer and occupational health team.</p>

<p>Then, you should only continue working if the risk assessment advises that it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>This means that your employer should remove or manage any risks. If this cannot be done, you should be offered suitable alternative work or working arrangements (including working from home) or be suspended on your normal pay.</p>

<p>Where adjustments to the work environment and role are not possible (for example, manufacturing or retail industries) and alternative work cannot be found, you should be suspended on paid leave.</p>

<p>Your employer should ensure you are able to adhere to any active national guidance on social distancing.</p>

<p>Some higher risk occupations such as those with greater public contact or in healthcare may carry a higher risk of exposure to the virus. In healthcare settings this may include working in specific higher risk areas or higher risk procedures as summarised in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">guidance on infection prevention and control</a>.</p>

<p>You should be supported by your employer with appropriate risk mitigation in line with recommendations to staff arising from workplace risk assessment.</p>

<p>If alternative work cannot be found, advice on suspension and pay can be found in <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/mothers/index.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">HSE guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>The following recommendations apply for pregnant women at any gestation who are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated</h3>

<p>If you are pregnant and unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated, you should take a more precautionary approach.</p>

<p>This is because you have an increased risk of becoming severely ill and of pre-term birth if you contract COVID-19. Therefore, you should seriously consider getting the COVID-19 vaccine and completing your vaccination schedule of 2 doses to protect yourself and your baby.</p>

<p>All employers should undertake a workplace risk assessment as set out above, and where appropriate consider both how to redeploy these staff and how to maximise the potential for homeworking, wherever possible.</p>

<p>Where adjustments to the work environment and role are not possible (for example in manufacturing or retail industries) and alternative work cannot be found, you should be suspended on paid leave. Advice on suspension and pay can be found in <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/mothers/index.htm">HSE guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The government has published the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 response – summer 2021</a> setting out the shape of step 4 of the roadmap. The government has also published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021">COVID-19 Response: Autumn and Winter Plan 2021</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>This guidance was first produced in March 2020 to support both employers and pregnant women with the risks associated with COVID-19 at work, following the government’s decision to place pregnant women in a high-risk category.</p>

<p>On 11 May 2020, the UK government issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance for employers, businesses and workers in England, with information around staying open safely during the pandemic</a>. This guidance is regularly reviewed and may be revised, so employers will want to ensure they are referring to the most up-to-date guidance for their sector.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives and the Faculty of Occupational Medicine will continue to act as clinical advisers to government on any occupational health advice for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
