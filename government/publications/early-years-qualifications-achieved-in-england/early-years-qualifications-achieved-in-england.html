<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This guidance covers qualifications gained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You should consult the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualifications-achieved-outside-england">Early years qualifications achieved outside England</a> guidance for qualifications gained in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Europe</li>
  <li>Rest of the world</li>
</ul>

<h2>Qualifications achieved in England</h2>

<p>Early years providers can use these early years qualifications lists to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check if an individual’s qualification meets the approved <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualifcations-pre-september-2014-criteria">‘full and relevant’ criteria for early years qualifications</a>
</li>
  <li>check if an individual’s qualification meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-educator-level-3-qualifications-criteria">level 3 early years educator criteria</a>
</li>
  <li>check if an individual’s qualification meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-practitioner-level-2-qualifications-criteria">level 2 early years practitioner criteria</a>
</li>
  <li>confirm if an individual counts in the staff:child ratios set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">early years foundation stage framework</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualifications started before 1 September 2014</h3>

<p>Staff who completed or registered for a qualification before 1 September 2014 must hold a qualification that meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualifcations-pre-september-2014-criteria">full and relevant criteria for early years qualifications</a> in order to count towards the level 2 or level 3 early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>) staff:child ratios. Candidates who achieved level 3 qualifications before Sept 2014 do not need to hold level 2 literacy and numeracy qualifications.</p>

<p>Search our complete list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualifications-achieved-in-england">all approved pre-September 2014 early years qualifications</a>.</p>

<p>The qualification is not approved for working in the staff:child ratios if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is not listed</li>
  <li>is listed but is not full and relevant</li>
  <li>does not match exactly the title on the spreadsheet</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to consult the spreadsheet to find out which level 3 and level 2 early years qualifications are approved for working in staff:child ratios after 1 September 2014. These can be used if anyone wants to undertake a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> approved early years qualification.</p>

<h3>Qualifications started after 1 September 2014</h3>

<p>Following a review of the level 3 early years educator (<abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr>) criteria, a reformed set of criteria was introduced in 2014. In response to this, awarding organisations were asked to adapt their qualifications to meet the new criteria and then resubmit the qualification to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> for approval and addition to the post-2014 tab of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eyfs-staffchild-ratios-dfe-approved-qualifications">early years qualifications list</a> (EYQL).</p>

<p>If a qualification appears on the pre-2014 tab but not the post-2014 tab, it could be that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the awarding body did not resubmit it to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> for approval</li>
  <li>did resubmit it but the qualification was not approved and added to the EYQL</li>
  <li>the awarding body adapted the qualification and resubmitted it under a different name</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to NCFE CACHE and Pearson early years educator (<abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr>) and early years practitioner (<abbr title="early years practitioner">EYP</abbr>) qualification certificates</h3>

<p>When employing a member of staff, you will need to check NCFE CACHE and Pearson qualification certificates to establish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the learner has achieved a ‘knowledge only pathway’ early years educator (<abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr>) or early years practitioner (<abbr title="early years practitioner">EYP</abbr>) qualification</li>
  <li>if the qualification has not met the <abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr> criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be clearly displayed on the certificate.</p>

<p>Where the achievement of the qualification is ‘knowledge only pathway’ or does not state the <abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr> status, the holder cannot be counted in the staffing ratios. The ‘knowledge only pathway’ <abbr title="early years educator">EYE</abbr> or <abbr title="early years practitioner">EYP</abbr> qualification allows the learner to progress to further education or higher education.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncfe.org.uk" rel="external">NCFE CACHE website</a>
</li>
  <li>see which qualifications are affected using the qualifications spreadsheet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Level 2</h3>

<p>From 1 September 2014 until 31 August 2019, all level 2 early years qualifications are full and relevant if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years (0 to 5 years) related and appropriate to early years practice</li>
  <li>Ofqual-approved and included on their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://register.ofqual.gov.uk" rel="external">list of regulated qualifications</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Appropriate to early years practice means that the qualification needs to be relevant to working in an early years setting that covers childcare and child development for the 0 to 5 age range. A level 2 qualification in babysitting, for example, would not be appropriate to early years practice.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2019, all level 2 qualifications must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-practitioner-level-2-qualifications-criteria">level 2 early years practitioner criteria</a>. Awarding organisations have developed these qualifications and they have been available from 1 September 2019.</p>

<p>Search our list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualifications-achieved-in-england">approved early years qualifications that meet the level 2 early years practitioner criteria</a>. We will update this list when new qualifications are added.</p>

<h3>Level 3</h3>

<p>From 1 September 2014, all level 3 qualifications must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-educator-level-3-qualifications-criteria">early years educator criteria</a>. This means that all staff who have registered for a qualification since that date can be counted in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> staff:child ratios at level 3 if they hold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a level 3 early years educator qualification</li>
  <li>suitable level 2 literacy and numeracy qualifications</li>
</ul>

<p>Search our full list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualifications-achieved-in-england">early years qualifications that meet the early years educator criteria</a>.</p>

<p>If a person holds a level 3 early years qualification but does not have suitable level 2 literacy and numeracy qualifications, you can only count them at level 2 in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> staff:child ratios.</p>

<p>If a person holds a level 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 that is not on our list of approved early years educator qualifications, they may be able to count in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> staff:child ratios at level 2 providing that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the qualification was taken between 1 September 2014 and 31 August 2019</li>
  <li>the qualification is 0 to 5 years related</li>
  <li>the qualification is appropriate to early years practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Appropriate to early years practice means that the qualification covers childcare and child development for the 0 to 5 age range.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2019, level 3 (or above) qualifications started on or after this date cannot be counted in the level 2 staff:child ratios as shown above. From 1 September 2019 those qualification not listed as full and relevant for level 3, regardless of level, cannot be counted in the level 2 staff:child ratio. This is due to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-practitioner-level-2-qualifications-criteria">level 2 early years practitioner criteria</a>.</p>

<p>These are the minimum qualification requirements that we expect staff to have if they want to work in an early years setting. However, employers can set their own higher qualification requirements when recruiting staff if they wish. Employers would need to ensure that higher level qualifications are either on the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> approved list or that the employee also holds a <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> approved level 3 qualification.</p>

<p>We also do not set entry requirements for early years training courses. Training providers set their own entry requirements for entry to courses.</p>

<h3>Level 2 literacy and numeracy qualifications</h3>

<p>Holders of level 3 qualifications started after 1 September 2014 will also need to hold a suitable level 2 qualification in literacy and numeracy.</p>

<p>Staff who have registered for a qualification since 1 September 2014 that meets the full and relevant criteria must also have suitable level 2 literacy and numeracy qualifications to count towards the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> staff:child ratios at level 3.</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<p>English</p>

<ul>
  <li>functional skills qualification in English at level 2</li>
  <li>GCSE/International GCSE qualification in English language and/or literature to at least grade C (grade 4)</li>

<h2>Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish qualifications</h2>

<h3>Qualifications started after September 2014</h3>

<p>The early years educator qualifications that started on 1 September 2014 are for England only. Anyone with a qualification from another nation of the UK, who you want to count at level 3 in the&nbsp;<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>&nbsp;staff:child ratios, may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take additional modules as part of their course</li>
  <li>attain appropriate&nbsp;level 2 literacy and numeracy qualifications</li>

<h3>Qualifications started after September 2014 for learners from Scotland</h3>

<p>Candidates in Scotland who have completed qualifications which are listed on the post 2014 tab of the early years qualifications list can be considered full and relevant.</p>

<p>In addition, people with a Scottish Vocational Qualification 3: children’s care, learning and development at SCQF level 7, who wish to count at level 3 in the&nbsp;<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>&nbsp;staff:child ratios, also need to achieve the following 5 optional units:</p>

<p>If the answer to your question or query cannot be found above, please contact Ecctis.&nbsp;Further information on the guidance that Ecctis is able to provide can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ecctis.com/Qualifications/eys/Default.aspx" rel="external">Ecctis website</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that if you have contacted the early years workforce team at the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>&nbsp;prior to 5 September 2022, you do not need to contact Ecctis.</p>

<h2>Approving new qualifications</h2>

<p>Please note we ask all awarding organisations to map their qualifications to hold full and relevant status listed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eyfs-staffchild-ratios-dfe-approved-qualifications">early years qualifications list</a> (EYQL). We set this requirement, as required as a regulated profession, to ensure a consistent and high-quality standard of childcare and early years education.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations can submit applications for qualifications to be mapped against the level 2 or level 3 criteria. The process for this is for awarding organisations to contact us at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:EarlyYearsEducator.QUALIFICATIONS@education.gov.uk">EarlyYearsEducator.QUALIFICATIONS@education.gov.uk</a> where we will then assess their qualifications fully.</p>

<h2>Special educational needs and disability (<abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>)</h2>

<p>All early years providers are required to have arrangements in place to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify and support children with special educational needs or disabilities</li>
  <li>promote equality of opportunity for children in their care</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2"><abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> framework</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has worked with organisations specialising in <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> to create a level 3 early years special educational needs coordinator (<abbr title="special educational needs coordinator">SENCO</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-level-3-senco">qualification specification</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-level-3-senco">role description</a> for those working in non-maintained early years settings.</p>

<p>The documents, developed by the group, are intended as guidance for early years providers and practitioners to help to clarify the role of the early years <abbr title="special educational needs coordinator">SENCO</abbr>. They should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">special educational needs and disability code of practice</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="special educational needs coordinator">SENCO</abbr> qualification specification and job description are available on the following websites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://foundationyears.org.uk/2018/04/ey-senco" rel="external">Foundation years</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sendgateway.org.uk/resources/ey-senco-l3-qualification-specification" rel="external"><abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> gateway: EY <abbr title="special educational needs coordinator">SENCO</abbr> level 3 qualification specification</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Awarding organisations will use the qualification specification to develop qualifications for anyone wanting to specialise at level 3 as an early years <abbr title="special educational needs coordinator">SENCO</abbr>. However, it is not mandatory for an individual in non-maintained settings to hold a level 3 early years <abbr title="special educational needs coordinator">SENCO</abbr> qualification.</p>

<p>SENCOs in local authority maintained schools are required to have qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) and to gain the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-award-for-sen-co-ordination-learning-outcomes">Master’s-level National Award for Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator</a> within 3 years of taking up the post.</p>

<p>We have developed a level 2 early years <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> qualification specification, which provides continuing professional development (<abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr>) for level 2 practitioners who achieved a qualification before the introduction of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-practitioner-level-2-qualifications-criteria">new level 2 early years practitioner criteria</a>.</p>

<p>The level 2 <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> specification is intended as guidance for early years providers and level 2 practitioners who wish to develop knowledge and skills of working with babies and children with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr>. It also provides guidance for awarding organisations and training providers to develop qualifications or training courses.</p>

<p>The level 2 <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> specification can be found on the following websites:</p>
