<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the College Financial Forecasting Return (<abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>) guidance. This guide describes each sheet and provides instruction for completion of the fields required. Further guidance on user inputs is given in the Guide sheet of the workbook, as well as in individual cells where the information symbol is shown (click cells containing this symbol to see information and guidance).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> allows the insertion of extra sheets into the workbook for users to carry out their own workings. Any changes to the structure of the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>’s original sheets will however, result in the rejection of the return and resubmission will be required. Please ensure that there are no links to external documents when you submit the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>, as this will also result in a resubmission being required.</p>

<p>If you still encounter issues in the workbook after reading this document and the in-workbook guidance, or have any suggestions about additional support or guidance that would help then please contact us using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>
<abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> (Table of Contents)</h2>

<p>This sheet sets out the structure of the workbook. The <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> has been designed so that it should be completed in the order listed on this sheet. Users can click on any of the sheet names and be taken to the top of that sheet of the workbook. Every input and output sheet has “<abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr>” written in cell A3 (top left), and users can click on this to be taken back to the <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> sheet.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> also contains the workbook check summaries in columns A and B, so that users can quickly identify where an error has occurred. This sheet should be checked prior to submission, as any college submission will be rejected if there are outstanding error checks to resolve and the workbook will then need to be resubmitted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Error checks</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> uses error checks on its input sheets to minimise user error. Where an error arises, the row in which the check has flagged will show an ‘Error’ message in column A. The sheet containing the error will also show an ‘Error’ message in cell A2, while cell A1 informs the user that the workbook contains an error in one or more sheets.</p>

<p>As noted above, to see an overview of any errors, click on the <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> link in cell A3 on any sheet and the user will be taken to the <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> sheet.</p>

<p>On input sheets, if A2 is showing an ‘Error’ message, click on the cell to be taken to the row containing the error; then click on the ‘Error’ cell in the row to be taken to the right-most section of the sheet, where an explanation for each check is available by hovering the cursor over the information symbols.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Navigating through the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>
</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> received key feedback from the sector about improving the useability of the workbook. Hyperlinks are included throughout the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> that will take users to inputs and sheets that will save time.</p>

<p>Users should familiarise themselves with the links available in the top left of every input and output sheet and learn to use these to reduce the time required to complete the workbook; locate errors; and make amendments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Monitoring sheets</h2>

<p>This year, the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> contains 5 additional sheets to the right of the Monitoring Guide sheet, which is also new:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct CF</li>
  <li>Cash Profile</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Summary</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> variances</li>
  <li>Cash summary</li>
</ul>

<p>These should only be completed by colleges that are subject to enhanced financial monitoring by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> because they have been in receipt of Restructuring Facility, Exceptional Financial Support, Emergency Funding or Exceptional Restructuring Funding. <strong>Colleges which have not been directly notified by the <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> Provider Market Oversight directorate should ignore these sheets</strong>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Guide</h2>

<p>This sheet provides a college with a key of the different cell types within the workbook and summary instructions for completion of the workbook.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Suggested order of completion and minimum inputs (rows 36-86)</h3>

<p>Please ensure that anyone completing the workbook familiarises themselves with this sheet as it will greatly simplify the inputting experience. The guide provides a suggested order of completion on rows 36-86, distinguishing between areas of the workbook that are part of the minimum requirement (yellow) or optional inputs (green).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Input and output sheets guidelines (rows 87-132)</h3>

<p>This section sets out links to the individual parts of the workbook. They are presented in the recommended order of completion. Where multiple users are completing the workbook, the cells in column E can be used to leave notes to each other, e.g., Cell E97 could contain “Have you checked learner number assumptions for FY2023?”, and cell E121 could contain “Can you check the FH grade self-assessment?”.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>
<abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> and loans input guidance</h3>

<p>The remainder of the sheet contains guidance on completing the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> inputs and the loans inputs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Inverted signage</h3>

<p>The workbook is designed for most inputs to be positive. However, sometimes negative entries are required to derecognise income or expenditure. Entering inverted signage will not result in an error. This is also the case for most balance sheet items such as working capital and capital grant liabilities. These accounts can enter an inverted position (negative debtors / positive creditors) without triggering an error. The workbook may issue a warning when these entries are made, but this is only to check that the user intended to enter the unexpected input and will not impact submission. Non-current asset accounts and loan accounts should not enter a negative position, as this will result in an error.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Setup</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Cover Sheet</h3>

<p>This is the first input sheet, where users must enter their name and specify the dates that apply to the workbook. The college details will populate automatically once the college name is chosen in the dropdown cell E10.
Next, users should enter the first and last day of actuals entered in the workbook. All users must ensure that their starting date is 1 August 2021, however users may choose to end their actuals at the end of April, May, or June.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Year-to-date (YTD) option</h3>

<p>As for last year’s return of the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>, users have the option to enter a YTD figure in the last month of their actuals. This was designed to save time in splitting out all actuals back to August. Users should specify if they are doing this in cell E29.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If a college says ‘yes’ in cell E29, they are telling the workbook that they wish to enter all of their monthly actuals. If ‘no’ is selected, the workbook will adjust the formatting on the I&amp;E sheet so that a single YTD figure can be entered in the last month of actuals.</p>
</div>

<p>Entering your <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> actuals on a YTD basis will save time; however, the inputter must ensure that this is made consistent throughout the rest of the workbook. For example, any inputs for capital expenditure must be entered in the last month of actuals, and on the ‘BS Forecasts’, working capital must be flatlined until the last month of actuals where the closing balance at the end of the final month of actuals should be entered. See section 19 below to read about completing the workbook with this option. All other parts of the guidance assume that monthly actuals are being entered.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Learners and staff</h2>

<p>Please enter your learner assumptions for FY2022, 2023 and 2024. The actual learner numbers from FY2021 are an optional input (coloured in green).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>
<abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Monthly</h2>

<p>Users should complete the recognition of income and expenditure for the relevant periods in this sheet. It includes inputs for prior, current, and 2 future financial years. While the prior year is optional (green cells), users should complete the current and 2 forecast years’ entries in line with the requirements of the College Financial Planning Handbook. A 12-year optional forecast is also available. Use the link in cell V6 to take you there quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Actuals must be entered on this page</strong>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Links to other sheets</h3>

<p>Note that some <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> rows require the user to follow hyperlinks in columns E-G that will lead to the input sections on different sheets. Therefore, it is not possible to completely fill in the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> sheets without populating at least some of the below BS related inputs and Investing Inputs. This is so that data is only entered once, which avoids duplication and reduces the risk of errors in the workbook.</p>

<p>There are 2 possible approaches:</p>

<ol>
  <li>While filling in the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> inputs, ignore the line items that are linking to other sheets and cannot be filled in on the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> sheet(s). This means you would not be able to get a full picture of the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> before completing the BS inputs but will be able to maintain the flow of the workbook and minimise switching between sheets.</li>
  <li>As you are filling in the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> inputs, use the links provided (in columns E-G) to navigate to the relevant workbook sections where you can fill in the specific inputs linking to the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr>. This will allow you to have completed the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> inputs and have a full view of the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> before moving on to the remaining inputs. Take note of the units and signage on each row.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Financial values need to always be entered in thousands of pounds without using currency signs</strong>. Manually enter financial figures in the yellow cells (actuals and forecasts) and green cells (optional inputs for prior year and 12-year forecast).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#annexa">Annex A</a> gives a breakdown of what should be contained in certain income or expenditure lines, where this is not specified in the workbook itself.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Education-specific EBITDA</h3>

<p>Users should enter any Restructuring Facility related expenditure into the Education-specific EBITA section in row 170 to ensure this figure is correct.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>
<abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Annual</h2>

<p>This optional sheet allows users to update their forecasts using profiles and annual forecast figures. If the user prefers to use monthly, manually entered forecasts, they can ignore this sheet.</p>

<p>This is a useful tool for <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> lines where there is usually a set profile to how income or expenditure is recognised through the year (straight-lined or otherwise). The user can manually forecast some lines on the Monthly sheet and profile others on the Annual sheet.</p>

<p>Ensure that you have entered actuals on the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Monthly sheet before using this sheet. The workbook pulls actuals through from the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Monthly sheet to populate the corresponding months in the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Annual sheet.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell the workbook which lines you would like to profile using column G. Where ‘Monthly’ is selected, the workbook will pull actuals and forecast data through from the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Monthly sheet. If “Annual” is selected, the workbook will only pull actuals through from the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Monthly sheet and look for profiling information from column E and Columns W:Y to complete the forecast.</li>
  <li>To create profiles, go to the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Profiles sheet and create a profile name in column D, then fill out the profile in columns AA:BJ.</li>
  <li>This profile should now appear on the dropdown list in column G of the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Annual sheet. Select the profile you want.</li>
  <li>Enter the forecast for each year in columns W:Y.</li>
  <li>The workbook should now have profiled a forecast for all future months.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should still see forecasts for the lines labelled as ‘Monthly’ in column G (if you have entered forecasts manually on <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Monthly), as the workbook aggregates all <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> data in this sheet to complete the outputs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Opening Balances</h2>

<p>In this sheet, the user can enter their opening Balance Sheet for the current financial year (as at 1 August).
The user can also enter their opening balances for FY2021 (as at 1 August 2020) if they wish to use the prior year in the workbook. These cells are green to indicate that they are optional. If users do this, it will activate prior year balance checks on the other input sheets, which should be addressed before continuing with the current and future forecast years.</p>

<p>Accounts can be entered with negative signage, for example, where capital grants have entered a debtor position, and this will provoke a warning but not an error in the workbook.</p>

<p>The workbook will check that the college’s opening position balances.</p>

<p>Please be advised that when the loan opening balances are entered, this will trigger errors on the loan sheet until the user reconciles the opening balances on the loans data table.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Investing Inputs</h2>

<p>The ‘Investing Inputs’ sheet comprises inputs for specific capital items and includes 6 separate sections.</p>

<p>In using this sheet, we recommend that the college use the links in the top left to quickly navigate through the page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Capital expenditure (rows 8 to 47)</h3>

<p>This section covers capital expenditure (additions). Users input a description of each capital project / acquisition in column D and select the asset type from a dropdown box in Column E. In column F users should enter the source of any funding (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> / finance lease / donation) and in column G a college inputs the percentage of the capital spend that is capital grant funded. If the addition is 100% college funded, column G should be left blank. The % grant funded column does not affect any outputs; it is simply for information. From column AA onwards the value of the additions should be manually profiled across the actual and forecast periods.</p>

<p>Investment additions should be added in the Account Balances section.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Assets under Construction (rows 48 to 72)</h3>

<p>Users can enter the points at which Assets under Construction are completed and moved into a new Non-current asset (NCA) category.</p>

<p>Users should input expenditure on AUC in the Capex section (above) by describing the project in column D before selecting ‘Assets under Construction’ in the column E dropdown.</p>

<p>Once the project is completed, the balance can be transferred out of AUC and into the correct NCA account using the Asset under Construction section. The project should be described in column D, before designating the NCA group that the value of the asset is being transferred to in column E, the date of transfer in column F and finally the Net Book Value (NBV) of the asset in column G.</p>

<p>Once a date and NBV have been entered, columns AA:BJ will auto populate so that the transfer will flow through to the correct account balance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span>Revaluations (rows 73 to 98)</h3>

<p>This section covers revaluations to Non-current assets (NCA). A college must describe the revalued asset(s) in column D and choose a category for the NCA asset from the dropdown list in column E. The date of the revaluation is input in Column F. In column G, users should enter the revaluation amount.</p>

<p>Once a date and revaluation amount have been entered, columns AA:BJ will auto populate so that the transfer will flow through to the correct account balance.</p>

<p>Transfers from the Revaluation Reserve to the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> Reserve and vice versa can be set up at the bottom of the BS Forecasts sheet.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>Assets held for sale - AHFS (rows 99 to 124)</h3>

<p>Users can use this section to transfer assets intended for sale out of the NCA accounts and into current assets.</p>

<p>Users should complete the table in rows D:G to provide details of the asset being held for sale. The project should be described in column D, before selecting how the asset is currently classified in column E. Next, the date of moving to held for sale and the NBV can be entered. Once the details are completed, columns AA:BJ will auto populate so that the transfer will flow through to the correct account balance.</p>

<p>If the asset needs to be shown at fair value rather than book value, users should use the Revaluation section to make the appropriate changes before moving the asset to AHFS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.5 </span>Disposals (rows 125 to 144)</h3>

<p>This section covers disposals of NCAs, including investments. Enter a description of the disposal in column D. In column E, select which asset category of NCA is relevant from the dropdown list. Columns F, G and H should be populated with information about the disposal (column F – date of sale, column G - gross sale value, and column H - NBV of the NCA).</p>

<p>The greyed section below the input table in rows 125 to 144 can be ignored. This section prepares data to be taken to other parts of the workbook.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.6 </span>Account Balances (rows 210 to 309)</h3>

<p>This section summarises the entries made in the 5 sections listed above, by type of NCA. Users should enter depreciation for each NCA account in this section.</p>

<p>This section is used to enter investments additions, and fixed asset retentions should also be entered here. Fixed asset retentions (FAR) relate to the acquisition of fixed assets which have not yet been paid. Note that movements in year are split into 4 categories: Land &amp; Buildings, Equipment, Investments and Other NCA. A positive figure should be entered here to tell the workbook that funds are being withheld. As funds are paid, negative figures should be entered to reduce the FAR closing balance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.7 </span>NCA Reclassifications</h3>

<p>Where NCAs require reclassification, users should use the transfers section at the end of the Investing Inputs sheet.</p>

<p>Select the accounts involved in the reclassification in column D, before entering the increase in the first NCA account. These figures will flow up into the summary of each NCA account in the rows above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Loans</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Loans data table</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> has been designed to allow users to manually input their loan repayment and interest payment schedules for each loan. The loans sheet begins with a blank data table of all loans drawn down by a college.
Users should begin by listing their loans in the data table, starting with the lender (col. D), loan category (col. E), Total Loan Amount (col. F), Loan Opening Balance (i.e., outstanding amount at 1 August of the current year (col. G) and any Accrued interest payable in relation to the loan (Col. H).</p>

<p>Next, enter the Loan Term Start and End Dates in cols. I and J and leave column K as ‘No’ before entering the interest rate attached to the loan in column L. The Loan Covenants columns (M:O) are optional inputs but can be used to tell the workbook a year end date in column M at which to classify the loans balance as due within one year when a breached loan covenant is forecast.</p>

<p>The remaining columns of the table are only relevant if the user wants to use the automatic interest calculator (see section below).</p>

<p>In rows 40-43, a table will provide the total opening balance that was entered on the ‘Opening Balances’ sheet. Users must ensure that the opening balances entered in the loans data table match what was entered on the ‘Opening Balances’ sheet.</p>

<p><strong>Users should be aware that when they enter the loan amounts on the ‘Opening Balances’ sheet, this will trigger a balance check in rows 40-43 on the ‘Loans’ sheet</strong>. Users can remove the error by correctly completing column G of the loans data table (‘Loan Opening Balance’ column).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Manual entry</h3>

<p>This will be the most popular entry method for users.</p>

<p>Once the loans data table is complete, for each loan from row 45 downwards users can begin to enter their drawdowns, capital repayments, early repayments, accrued interest, and interest paid and early repayment fees in columns AA:BV. Users may need to scroll to the right to see these input lines.</p>

<p>Early repayments are separated so that these do not impact on the college’s debt service cover ratio, which is part of the proposed FH scoring system being trialled in the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>. Users should only enter obligatory loan payments (as per the loan agreement) on the regular capital repayment lines for each loan.</p>

<p>As seen on other input sheets, there are optional green cells in column V and columns BX: CI to allow the college to enter prior year and long-term data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span>Automatic entry</h3>

<p>If users would like their interest payments to be calculated by the workbook, select “Yes” in column P on the loans table. This will unlock the remaining cells where you can inform the workbook of the frequency of payments and compounding. If the interest rates are variable, “Yes” can be selected in column K on the Loans table and a forecast interest rate can be entered next to the table in columns AA:BJ.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The date of first forecast interest payment must be after the last date of actuals entered on the Cover Sheet. Actual interest expense and payments (i.e., that occurred during the actuals period) must be entered manually.</p>
</div>

<p>Additional guidance for loans can be found on the ‘Guide’ sheet.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>BS Forecasts</h2>

<p>On this sheet, users will be able to enter the closing balances of all their working capital accounts, as well as enter movements for Investments in Joint Ventures, Finance Lease Obligations, Capital Grant Liability and Pension provisions.</p>

<p>Users should enter the monthly closing balances for each account. There are checks to ensure that the entire BS Forecast balances.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr> calculates cash on an indirect basis, therefore the monthly movements in working capital will determine the college’s monthly cash position.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>Pension provisions</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> understands that it is almost impossible for users to predict certain elements of their LGPS pension provision (actuarial gain/loss, expected return on assets) and they should either leave those lines empty, or enter amounts that match the prior year’s figures. However, some of the items in the LGPS scheme have an impact on a college’s operating surplus, such as employer contributions paid, current service charge and past service costs. Users should attempt to forecast these as a best estimate, relying on prior year data if necessary. Primary and secondary employer contribution rates are available to colleges on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.lgpsboard.org/" rel="external">LGPS Board website</a> and these can be used to create a forecast in the workbook.</p>

<p>These lines are included in full so that the new Finance Record can have corresponding line codes with the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>Transfers between reserves</h3>

<p>At the bottom of the sheet, users can arrange transfers between reserves (e.g., where a revaluation has resulted in additional depreciation and the revaluation reserve must offset this on the <abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>User template</h2>

<p>This is an optional sheet where the user can set out their workings using the workbook’s timeline. Rows can be inserted.</p>

<p>If preferable, the user can also simply add a new blank sheet to the workbook and set out their workings in a familiar format before completing the inputs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Fin Stat</h2>

<p>There are no inputs in this sheet: it is a reporting output sheet. This section provides a college with 3 years of financial statements comprising SOCI, balance sheet, direct and indirect cash flows. If the college has completed optional inputs on <strong>every</strong> input sheet (e.g., prior year, long-term forecasts), this will pull through to the financial statements as well. The same principle applies to additional forecast year data.</p>

<p>Each row of the financial statements is hyperlinked to take you to the source information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Ratios</h2>

<p>There are no inputs in this sheet: it is a reporting output sheet. This section provides a college with 3 years of performance-related ratios. If the college has completed optional inputs on <strong>every</strong> input sheet (e.g., prior year, long-term forecasts), this will pull through to the outputs as well.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Financial Health</h2>

<p>This section provides a college with the calculated <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> financial health ratios based on the workbook inputs. The template calculates the autoscore financial health points score and grade. A college must enter a self-assessment of financial health using the dropdown list. Where the self-assessed grade is different to the autoscore grade, a college will need to provide a rationale for this difference which will need to be consistent with the moderation criteria detailed in the Financial Planning Handbook. The existing system of financial health is the only score that will be used for formal assessments from this return.</p>

<p>This section also includes the proposed new financial health scoring system. Users are not obliged to enter a self-assessment, but if you have feedback for the proposed system these can be left in the self-assessment box. We are including the proposed Financial Health methodology as part of our consultation with users on the new system. This score will not be used for any formal Financial Health Assessments in FY2022 (the year ending 31 July 2022). Please look out for communications from <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> about consultation with users on Financial Health if you have feedback or are interested in getting involved.</p>

<p>If you would like to provide feedback or thoughts on improving the proposed system, please contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>Cash Flow Summary</h2>

<p>There are no manual inputs in this sheet: it is a calculation sheet. This sheet visualises the college’s cash position over the assessment period. The first graph shows the monthly cash balance and how operating, investing and financing activities influenced any movements. The second graph shows the monthly cash balance and cash days. An abridged Statement of Cash Flows is also provided.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>WC Dashboard</h2>

<p>This sheet contains a graph that visualises the profile of trade receivables and trade payables. This is a tool to sense-check these key working capital accounts and how they change over the course of the year. Users should look for unexpected spikes, low points, or unusual movements and be able to understand why these are occurring.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>Dashboard</h2>

<p>This sheet summarises the overall position of the college. The sheet includes financial health scores for the assessment period, ratios on performance, financing, and solvency, as well as summarised financial statements and total debt. Graphs are available that show the users results compared to FEC benchmarks. If the college has its own benchmarks, these can be entered in column F and the graphs will update to include these.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">22. </span>YTD option</h2>

<p>If the college chooses to enter their actuals on a YTD basis, the following should be considered. If this advice is not followed, the Cash Flow Summary graph will show confusing data. Ideally the cash position should be flat from 1 August through to the end of the actuals period, at which point it will show the closing cash position before forecasts begin.</p>

<p>Upon selecting “No” against “Monthly breakdown provided for actuals for FY 2022”, the formatting of the workbook will change on the input sheets to aid entry.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.1 </span>
<abbr title="income and expenditure">I&amp;E</abbr> inputs</h3>

<p>Enter all actuals in a single YTD figure in the last month of actuals (the <abbr title="college financial forecasting return">CFFR</abbr>’s format should change to make it clear which month the user has chosen as the last month of actuals).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.2 </span>Investing Inputs</h3>

<p>Enter all YTD capital evens as if they occurred in the last month of actuals. For example, if May 31 has been selected as the last day of monthly actuals on the Cover Sheet, the following entries should be made:</p>

<p>If an asset was acquired in December, the data should be entered in May.</p>

<p>If a disposal occurred in January, the date of sale should be set to May in the workbook.</p>

<p>All YTD depreciation should be entered as a single figure in May.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.3 </span>Loans</h3>

<p>Enter all YTD drawdowns, capital repayments, early repayments, accrued interest, and interest paid in the last month of actuals.</p>

<p>If a loan term ends during the YTD period, the user should tell the workbook that the loan term end date is at the end of the actuals period to avoid an error flag on the ‘outstanding loan balance at term end’ check.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22.4 </span>BS Forecasts</h3>

<p>All opening balances should be flatlined out to the end of the YTD period, at which point the closing balance should be updated. For example, if the last day of monthly actuals is set at 31 May and the Trade receivables opening balance at 1 August is 500 (£500,000), the closing balance of trade receivables from August-April should be 500. In the last month of actuals, the latest closing balance should be shown.</p>

<p>All YTD transactions relating to investment in JVs, finance lease obligation, capital grants and provisions should be inputted as a single figure in the last month of actuals.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">23. </span>Optional year entry</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">23.1 </span>Prior year entry</h3>

<p>Users have the option of entering additional data in the prior year if they wish to. When the user first enters opening balances for the prior year (PY) on the ‘Opening Balances’ sheet, this will trigger some PY balance checks on the ‘Investing Inputs’, ‘Loans’ and ‘BS Forecasts’ sheets.</p>

<p>The user should not be alarmed, as they have not yet entered the necessary inputs to balance the PY. Continue through the workbook and once all prior year inputs have been entered, the error checks should have disappeared.</p>

<p>The user can easily find the PY error checks by going to the <abbr title="table of contents">ToC</abbr> sheet, identifying sheets that contain errors, and use the error finding technique outlined in section 3 to remove errors.</p>

<p>For this reason, if the PY is being used, we suggest that users complete this first before completing the current and forecast years in the workbook.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">23.2 </span>Additional forecast years</h3>

<p>For additional year figures to pull through to the Fin Stat sheet, and for the Fin Stat sheet to calculate correctly, the user must have inputted data in the corresponding column of every input sheet. Users can enter irrelevant amounts (0.0000001) in otherwise empty additional year columns to ensure that the data pulls through correctly to the Fin Stat sheet.</p>
