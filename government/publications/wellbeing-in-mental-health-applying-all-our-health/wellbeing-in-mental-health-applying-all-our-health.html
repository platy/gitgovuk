<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of ‘All Our Health’, a resource which helps health professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice. The information below will help front-line health and care professionals use their trusted relationships with patients, families and communities to improve their mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>We also recommend important actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.</p>

<h2>Access the mental health and wellbeing e-learning session</h2>

<p>An interactive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/587402" rel="external">e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use. The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) and Health Education England’s ‘e-Learning for Healthcare’ have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<h2>Promoting mental health in your professional practice</h2>

<p>Mental health problems are common, with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-survey-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-england-2014" rel="external">1 in 6 adults reporting a common mental health disorder</a>, such as anxiety, and there are close to 551,000 people in England with more severe mental illness (<abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr>) such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Problems are often hidden, stigma is still widespread, and many people are not receiving support to access services.</p>

<p>Together with substance misuse, mental illness accounts for 21.3% of the total burden of disease in England.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>  Poor mental health is estimated to carry an economic and social cost of £105 billion a year in England.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mental health problems and suicide can be preventable. Promoting good mental health will impact on physical health and many other aspects of people’s lives.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Mental health in numbers" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/84352/Infographic_-_mental_health_rates.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>Mental health promotion</h3>

<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mental health as ‘a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Our mental health influences our physical health, as well as our capability to lead a healthy lifestyle and to manage and recover from physical health conditions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>People with physical health problems, especially long-term conditions, are at increased risk of poor mental health - particularly depression and anxiety.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> Around 30% of people with any long-term physical health condition also have a mental health problem.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>  Poor mental health, in turn, exacerbates some long-term conditions, such as chronic pain.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Preventing mental health problems</h3>

<p>Mental health problems start early in life. Half of all mental health problems have been established by the age of 14, rising to 75% by age 24.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Impact of COVID-19</h3>

<p>Public Health England has been monitoring population mental health throughout the pandemic using a range of surveys close to real-time data. This shows that self-reported mental health and wellbeing at a population level (including in anxiety, stress and depression) has worsened during the pandemic and remains worse than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>The following groups have been found to be most at risk from poor mental health:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children and young people with particular characteristics</li>
  <li>young adults aged 18 to 34</li>
  <li>women (especially lone mothers)</li>
  <li>women experiencing domestic violence</li>
  <li>adults living alone</li>
  <li>adults with pre-existing mental health conditions</li>
  <li>adults with caring responsibilities[</li>
  <li>adults with low income</li>
  <li>adults who have experienced loss of income since the onset of the pandemic</li>
  <li>adults working in small businesses or are self-employed</li>
  <li>front line health and social care professionals</li>
  <li>adults with long-term physical health conditions</li>
  <li>older adults recommended to shield or with multi-morbidities</li>
  <li>children and men from certain minority ethnic backgrounds</li>
  <li>adults with COVID-19 symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Social risk factors include poverty, migration, extreme stress, exposure to violence (domestic, sexual and gender-based), emergency and conflict situations, natural disasters, trauma, and low social support, increase risk for poor mental health and specific disorders.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>Across the UK, those in the poorest fifth of the population are twice as likely to be at risk of developing mental health problems as those on an average income.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Children who have been neglected are more likely to experience mental health problems including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Social inequalities and mental illness" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/84353/Infographic_-_social_inequalities_and_mental_health.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>Preventing suicide</h3>

<p>In 2019, there were 5,691 suicides registered in England and Wales. Men are 3 times more likely to die by suicide than women, and suicide is the leading cause of death in men under 50 and women under 35.</p>

<p>Only 28% of all suicides include people who had contact with mental health services in the 12 months prior to death,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> and those who are bereaved are at increased risk themselves. However, many people have had contact with other services.</p>

<h3>Improving the physical health of people with mental health problems</h3>

<p>People with severe mental illness (<abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr>) such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia have a life expectancy up to 20 years less than the general population,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> and the gap is widening.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> This is mostly from preventable physical health problems, such as cardiovascular disease.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> It is estimated that for people with <abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr>, 2 in 3 deaths are due to physical illnesses and can be prevented.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>An adult (aged 15 to 74) with a serious mental illness is 1.8 times more likely to have 3 or more physical health conditions when compared to the general population, and a young adult (aged 15 to 34) with <abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr> is 5.1 times more likely to have 3 or more physical health conditions than the general population.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>Loneliness and lack of social interaction are also risk factors for physical and mental health – these factors increase risk of premature mortality by 30%.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Premature mortality and severe mental illness" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/84354/Infographic_-_mortality_rate_for_people_with_severe_mental_illness.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>Core principles for healthcare professionals</h3>

<p>Healthcare professionals can provide advice and support to people of all ages (presenting with any issue) and work to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the patient’s mental health and wellbeing needs</li>
  <li>help identify those at risk of poor mental health</li>
  <li>prevent mental health problems from developing or worsening</li>
  <li>prevent suicide</li>
</ul>

<p>When working with patients who have existing mental health problems, they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure their physical health needs are met</li>
  <li>support their social needs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<h3>Front-line health professionals</h3>

<p>Front-line health professionals can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-every-contact-count-mecc-practical-resources">‘Make every contact count’</a> resource, and take every opportunity to have brief conversations with people about making positive changes</li>
  <li>incorporate psychological aspects of care within all care pathways</li>
  <li>identify risk factors and symptoms of mental health problems</li>
  <li>signpost and refer appropriately<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>identify risk factors and indicators for potential self-harm and suicide and support individuals who may present with suicidal thoughts and refer appropriately<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>guide individuals with existing mental health problems through health promotion advice - and support them to access services to improve their physical health and wellbeing (screening, health checks)</li>
  <li>use basic coaching techniques to support an individual who may be experiencing mental distress</li>
</ul>

<p>Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a globally recommended training for supporting people during crisis and emergency situations. These 2 courses equip staff, volunteers and community members to provide practical and emotional support, as well as recognising people at risk of distress:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/psychological-first-aid-covid-19/1" rel="external">COVID-19: Psychological First Aid</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Team leaders or managers</h3>

<p>Team leaders or managers can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify staff learning and development needs in relation to mental health and wellbeing - and provide access to appropriate training</li>
  <li>build prevention and mental health promotion into day-to-day work</li>
  <li>work collaboratively with colleagues and other teams, to raise awareness of mental health and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness</li>
  <li>provide and promote healthier lifestyle choices within mental health settings - including healthier food options, access to physical activities, and support to reduce and stop smoking</li>
  <li>work with other local services to meet people’s social needs - for example housing, employment and welfare</li>
  <li>provide a psychologically safe environment for patients, visitors and staff and promote mental health in the workplace<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Senior or strategic leaders</h3>

<p>Senior or strategic leaders can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand the mental health needs of your local population using <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>’s Better Mental Health: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-mental-health-jsna-toolkit"><abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr> toolkit</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sign up to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevention-concordat-for-better-mental-health-consensus-statement">Prevention Concordat for Better Mental Health.</a> This is part of a wider drive to secure an increase in the implementation of public mental health approaches across the whole system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develop integrated systems to identify and support people with long term conditions who may experience mental health problems and to reduce the premature mortality of people with mental illness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work with community members, patient groups and other stakeholders to support collaborative action on improving mental health and wellbeing and reducing stigma associated with mental illness, including coproduction and community approaches</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Understanding local needs</h3>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-mental-health-jsna-toolkit">Better Mental Health: <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr> toolkit</a> links mental health data, policy and knowledge to help planners understand needs within the local population and assess local services.</p>

<p>The Mental Health and Wellbeing <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr> knowledge guide provides an overview of the areas to consider when thinking about the mental health needs in a local area, with a focus on understanding place factors and population groups across the life course.</p>

<p>These are accompanied by a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile-group/mental-health/profile/mh-jsna" rel="external">Mental Health and Wellbeing <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr></a> data profile and a report on key features of a good <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/publications/meeting-need" rel="external">Mental Health <abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr>.</a></p>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>Preventing mental health problems and suicide and promoting mental health will impact on overall life expectancy and healthy life expectancy.</p>

<p>There are a number of indicators in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-health-outcomes-framework">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> related to mental health and wellbeing. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school readiness</li>
  <li>adults in contact with secondary mental health services - who live in stable and appropriate accommodation, and are in employment</li>
  <li>sickness absence rate</li>
  <li>domestic abuse</li>
  <li>violent crime (including sexual violence)</li>
  <li>statutory homeless</li>
  <li>social isolation</li>
  <li>child development at 2 to 2.5 years</li>
  <li>emotional wellbeing of looked after children</li>
  <li>self-harm</li>
  <li>self-reported wellbeing</li>
  <li>excess mortality in adults with serious mental illness</li>
  <li>suicide rate</li>
  <li>health-related quality of life for older people</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/everyday-interactions-measuring-public-health-impact">Everyday Interactions: measuring public health impact</a> provides a quick, straightforward and easy way for health and care professionals to record and measure their public health impact in a uniform and comparable way.</p>

<p>The ultimate measure of physical health outcomes for people with mental health problems is an increased life expectancy and healthy life expectancy.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhs-standard-contract/cquin/cquin-17-19/" rel="external"><abbr title="Commissioning for Quality and Innovation">CQUIN</abbr> 2017 to 2019</a> by NHS England, focuses on improving physical healthcare to reduce premature mortality in people with serious mental illness (PSMI).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Commissioning for Quality and Innovation">CQUIN</abbr> was introduced to support NHS England’s commitment to reduce the 20-year premature mortality rate in people with serious mental illness through improved assessment, treatment interventions, and communication between clinicians in primary and secondary care services.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhs-standard-contract/cquin/cquin-20-21/" rel="external"><abbr title="Commissioning for Quality and Innovation">CQUIN</abbr> for 2020 to 2021</a> now also includes a secure mental health services indicator.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/pss4-healthy-weight-in-adult-secure-mental-health-services-pss-cquin/" rel="external">achieving healthy weight in adult secure mental health services <abbr title="Commissioning for Quality and Innovation">CQUIN</abbr> 2019 to 2020</a> by NHS England, aims to support a service environment and a systems approach to healthy lifestyles that takes account of the complexities of obesity for patients in adult secure mental health services.</p>

<p>The national <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2017/10/04/health-matters-preventing-ill-health-from-alcohol-and-tobacco-use/" rel="external">Health Matters: preventing ill health from alcohol and tobacco use</a> has the potential to reduce the risk of physical health conditions such as heart disease, as well as reduce future hospital admissions.</p>

<p>Data from the <abbr title="Commissioning for Quality and Innovation">CQUIN</abbr>’s first year of operation shows some improvements in the proportion of patients with mental health problems, who are being routinely screened and offered support for these health risks but there is wide variation across Mental Health Trusts.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/report-of-the-review-of-the-quality-and-outcomes-framework-in-england/" rel="external">Quality and Outcomes Framework (<abbr title="Quality and Outcomes Framework">QOF</abbr>) 2017 to 2018</a> includes several indicators relating to the physical health of people on the primary care register, for people with serious mental illness (patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses).</p>

<p>These indicators help to identify, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people with <abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr> who have a comprehensive care plan documented in their record in the preceding 12 months</li>
  <li>people with <abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr> who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 12 months</li>
  <li>percentage of patients with <abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr> who have a record of alcohol consumption in the preceding 12 months</li>
  <li>females aged 25 to 64 years with <abbr title="people with serious mental illness">SMI</abbr>, whose notes record that a cervical screening test has been performed in the preceding 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical health screening and monitoring is no longer the sole responsibility of physical healthcare professionals such as <abbr title="General practitioners (family doctors)">GPs</abbr> and practice nurses in primary care services. Every health and care professional has a role to look after the whole person. This integrated approach is supported by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/physical-and-mental-health" rel="external">Bringing together physical and mental health: A new frontier for integrated care</a>.</p>

<h2>Further reading, resources and good practice</h2>

<p>There are several programmes and campaigns that offer advice for patients and the public.</p>
