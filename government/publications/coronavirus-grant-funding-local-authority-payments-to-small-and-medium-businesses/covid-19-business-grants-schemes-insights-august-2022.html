<span class="number">1. </span> Key learnings</h2>

<p>These insights show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>almost £27 billion was allocated through the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 Business Grants scheme to local authorities in England, which delivered over 4.5 million payments totalling £22.6 billion, to businesses impacted by the pandemic</li>
  <li>micro, small, and medium sized businesses received 95% of the funding by value, totalling £21.3 billion</li>
  <li>over one-third of all funding was given to the Accommodation and Food Services sector
    <ul>
      <li>within targeted schemes: the Accommodation and Food Services sector received the largest funding share at 41%; followed by Other Services at 17%; Wholesale and Retail Trade at 16%; and Arts, Entertainment and Recreation at 14%</li>
      <li>discretionary schemes gave significant funding to over 10 different business sectors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>all regions reported a spend of between 81% and 87% of their total allocations; unspent funding is returned to the Treasury by way of scheme reconciliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>Throughout the course of the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 pandemic, the government put substantial financial support in place to protect as many businesses as possible from the effects of the legal requirements to close, and of the wider economic effects. The <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 Business Grant schemes were a significant element of this business support offer, allocating almost £27 billion of funding to local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) in England, to support businesses in their communities through a variety of schemes.</p>

<p>90% of this funding was provided via targeted schemes, available to business sectors that had been required by law to close, including hospitality, leisure and retail, and those which had been severely affected by restrictions or guidance put in place. The remaining 10% of funding was provided via discretionary schemes extending the reach of support to additional business sectors impacted by the pandemic. As <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 restrictions were relaxed, the Restart Grant scheme provided support to businesses as they reopened. In January 2022, in response to the Omicron variant, further funding, both targeted and discretionary, was provided. Full details of all schemes can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#definitions">Definitions section</a>.</p>

<h3>Funding allocations</h3>

<p>Business eligibility criteria varied by scheme and is defined for each scheme in the guidance provided to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-business-support-grant-funding" title="Coronavirus (COVID-19): business support grant funding - guidance for local authorities">earlier</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-restrictions-support-grants-lrsg-and-additional-restrictions-grant-arg-guidance-for-local-authorities" title="COVID-19 business grant funding schemes: guidance for local authorities">later</a> schemes. The allocation of funding to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> used calculations that considered the number of likely eligible businesses, using data provided by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) that included business sectors and rateable values. Some schemes used <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> population data or provided proportional uplifts to previous allocations. The guidance within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-grant-funding-local-authority-payments-to-small-and-medium-businesses">published data</a> provides further information for each scheme.</p>

<p>From Autumn 2020, allocations for targeted schemes were reduced by 10% to avoid significant overpayments to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. On completion of scheme reconciliation, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were provided with additional funds where they had spent more than their indicative allocation, to fund eligible businesses within targeted schemes. Discretionary schemes allowed <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to determine their own eligibility criteria and, as such, there were no additional funds provided upon reconciliation. Unspent funding from both types of scheme is returned to the Treasury.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<p><strong>Figure 1: Timeline of grant schemes showing opening to closing dates, all schemes, England</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Timeline of grant schemes showing opening to closing dates from March 2020 to March 2022, all schemes, England" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/158559/Figure1.svg"></div></figure>

<p>Source: Scheme guidance for local authorities</p>

<p>The timeline in Figure 1 shows the opening and closing dates of all <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 Business Grant schemes. Note that some schemes provided multiple instalments of payments throughout the time they were in operation, and that payments to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were usually within 2 weeks of the scheme opening date. Further details on all schemes are in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#definitions">Definitions section</a>.</p>

<p>The first allocation to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> was provided in March 2020 via the targeted Retail, Hospitality &amp; Leisure Grant Fund (<abbr title="Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund">RHLGF</abbr>) and Small Business Grant Fund (<abbr title="Small Business Grants Fund">SBGF</abbr>) schemes, followed by the discretionary Local Authority Discretionary Grant Fund (<abbr title="Local Authority Discretionary Grant Fund">LADGF</abbr>) scheme. These schemes are collectively known as ‘Cohort 1’ schemes.</p>

<p>‘Cohort 2’ schemes began in August 2020 with the Local Restrictions Support Grant (<abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr>) (Open), followed in September 2020 by the <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Closed), which included the sub schemes of the Closed Business Lockdown Payment (<abbr title="Closed Business Lockdown Payment">CBLP</abbr>) and <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Sectors) as the department adapted and extended schemes in the face of the unprecedented situation nationwide.</p>

<p>The discretionary Additional Restrictions Grant (<abbr title="Additional Restrictions Grant">ARG</abbr>) scheme began in November 2020 and was the longest running scheme, with 3 subsequent top-up allocations provided, closing in March 2022. The Christmas Support Payment (<abbr title="Christmas Support Payment">CSP</abbr>) ran over Christmas 2020 from December 2020 to March 2021. Following the lifting of restrictions, the Restart scheme ran from April to July 2021. The final scheme was the Omicron Hospitality &amp; Leisure Grant (<abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr>) scheme, which opened from January 2022 to March 2022.</p>

<h3>Data collections</h3>

<p>Following distribution of funding by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to businesses, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were asked to provide data on these payments.</p>

<p>For the first Cohort of grants, (<abbr title="Small Business Grants Fund">SBGF</abbr> and <abbr title="Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund">RHLGF</abbr>, and <abbr title="Local Authority Discretionary Grant Fund">LADGF</abbr>: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#definitions">Definitions section for details</a>) these data contained only aggregate figures for the number and value of payments. Data for <abbr title="Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund">RHLGF</abbr> and <abbr title="Small Business Grants Fund">SBGF</abbr> were collected together and are therefore presented jointly.</p>

<p>Beginning November 2020 for the subsequent schemes, in the second Cohort of grants, (<abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Open), <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Closed), <abbr title="Additional Restrictions Grant">ARG</abbr>, <abbr title="Christmas Support Payment">CSP</abbr>, Restart and <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr>) <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were asked to optionally provide more detailed monitoring and evaluation grant-level data as well as the aggregate figures. Details of the data fields collected in the grant-level data can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#definitions">Definitions section</a>.</p>

<p>The response rate was 79% for the first Cohort of the grant-level data collection. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> worked on a new improved data collection system, which was rolled out in October 2021. For the final schemes initiated in January 2022, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were asked to provide grant-level data only as part of the mandatory monitoring processes for the schemes and engagement was 90%. The grant-level data contains detailed information on 3.2 million payments from the total 3.5 million (91%) reported at aggregate level for Cohort 2 schemes. For this reason, comparisons of monetary values between the aggregate and grant-level figures are not possible.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-business-grant-funding-by-parliamentary-constituency-and-local-authority">Aggregate figures for the schemes</a> have been published by <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and by parliamentary constituency, throughout the course of the schemes. The insights presented here use these figures alongside the grant-level data which can now also be found at the link provided. All data are self-reported by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and although some quality assurance has been carried out, it has not been possible to fully verify all the data provided. The data are incomplete as not all local authorities have provided complete sets of data. This context should be considered when using the insights presented here.</p>

<h3>Payments to businesses</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Total number and value of grants paid, info available in text" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/158560/Figure2.svg"></div></figure>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 2 shows the total number and value of payments as reported by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> for each of the grant schemes. The <abbr title="Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund">RHLGF</abbr> and <abbr title="Small Business Grants Fund">SBGF</abbr> schemes had the highest total reported payments value of £11.1 billion, paid out through over 900,000 payments, and provided the highest average grant payment of £12,300.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Closed) scheme had the largest number of reported payments, although the total reported payment value was lower than <abbr title="Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund">RHLGF</abbr> and <abbr title="Small Business Grants Fund">SBGF</abbr>, at £5.1 billion.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Christmas Support Payment">CSP</abbr> was the smallest scheme by number and value of reported payments, and also had the lowest average payment amount of £1000, as set by the scheme guidance for all payments within the scheme.</p>

<h3>Allocations</h3>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 3 shows that £24.2 billion (90%) of the funding allocation was via targeted schemes (<abbr title="Retail, Hospitality and Leisure Grant Fund">RHLGF</abbr>, <abbr title="Small Business Grants Fund">SBGF</abbr>, Restart, <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Open), <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Closed) including <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (closed) sub schemes, <abbr title="Christmas Support Payment">CSP</abbr>, <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr>) where <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were provided with guidance that directed the funding by setting out eligibility criteria for businesses, for example the business sector or rateable value.</p>

<p>Discretionary schemes (<abbr title="Local Authority Discretionary Grant Fund">LADGF</abbr>, <abbr title="Additional Restrictions Grant">ARG</abbr>) were allocated £2.7 billion (10%) of the funding. In these schemes, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were encouraged to use the funding to support those businesses ineligible for the targeted schemes but that had been most severely impacted by the pandemic, or by way of wider support to the local business economy. Full scheme guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-business-support-grant-funding" title="Coronavirus (COVID-19): business support grant funding - guidance for local authorities">earlier</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-restrictions-support-grants-lrsg-and-additional-restrictions-grant-arg-guidance-for-local-authorities" title="COVID-19 business grant funding schemes: guidance for local authorities">later</a> schemes.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4: Percentage spending as a proportion of allocations, all schemes, England</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Percentage spending as a proportion of allocations, explained in text" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/158562/Figure4.svg"></div></figure>

<p>Source: <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> grants published data, 2022</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1098916/all-business-support-covid-grants-by-la-aug-2022.ods" rel="external">Download this chart’s data</a>.</p>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 4 shows the proportional spend reported for each scheme compared to the allocation provided. The average for all schemes was 84%, with the highest proportional spending coming from the 2 discretionary schemes of <abbr title="Local Authority Discretionary Grant Fund">LADGF</abbr> and <abbr title="Additional Restrictions Grant">ARG</abbr>, both at 97%.</p>

<p>The targeted schemes varied between 68% for the <abbr title="Local Restrictions Support Grant">LRSG</abbr> (Closed) scheme and 93% for the <abbr title="Christmas Support Payment">CSP</abbr> scheme. The final scheme, the <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr>, announced in December 2021, reached a proportional spend of 72%.</p>

<p>Spending on schemes by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> does not match 100% due to a variety of reasons. Allocations provided to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are indicative only, (see the information in <a class="govuk-link" href="#funding-allocations">Section 2 on Funding Allocations</a>) and may under- or over-estimate the number of eligible businesses. Also, not all eligible business will have applied for grants. On completion of scheme reconciliation, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were provided with additional funds where they had spent more than their indicative allocation to fund eligible businesses within targeted schemes. Discretionary schemes allowed <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to determine their own eligibility criteria and, as such, there were no additional funds provided upon reconciliation. Unspent funding is returned to the Treasury.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4.&nbsp;Business </span> characteristics</h2>

<h3>Business sectors</h3>

<p>The compliance rate for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> completing the “sector” field in the grant-level data overall was 76%, and 87% for the data collected in 2022. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were asked to record the business sector using the ONS Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" rel="external">detailed information is available from the ONS</a>.</p>

<p>Where payment information provided did not contain a sector or was recorded as ‘unknown’, (24% of the original data) we have removed these payments from the analysis presented here.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5: The proportional value of reported payments by business sector, Cohort 2 schemes, England</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Proportional value of reported payments by business sector, Cohort 2 schemes, explained in text" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/158563/Figure5.svg"></div></figure>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 5 shows that the Accommodation and Food Services sector received the largest proportion of payments by value at 36%. Other Services, which includes the activities of membership organisations, the repair of personal and household goods - and a variety of personal service activities not covered elsewhere in the classification - received the second largest at 19%. Wholesale and Retail Trade received 16%, and Arts, Entertainment and Recreation received 14%. Other sectors accounted for 15% of the payments. All sectors receiving at least 1% of payments are provided in the chart’s data download.</p>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 6 shows the top 4 sectors by payment value for targeted and discretionary schemes. Smaller sectors have been grouped but are provided in the chart’s data download.</p>

<p>For targeted schemes the guidance provided (available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-business-support-grant-funding" title="Coronavirus (COVID-19): business support grant funding - guidance for local authorities">earlier</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-restrictions-support-grants-lrsg-and-additional-restrictions-grant-arg-guidance-for-local-authorities" title="COVID-19 business grant funding schemes: guidance for local authorities">later</a> schemes), meant that there was greater definition regarding business eligibility which included regulations on business sectors and rateable values. Figure 6 shows that payments made through targeted schemes were highest in the Accommodation &amp; Food Services sector at 41%, followed by Other Services at 17%, Wholesale and Retail Trade at 16% and Arts, Entertainment and Recreation at 14%. Just 12% of payments relate to sectors not accounted for by these top 4 sectors.</p>

<p>Discretionary schemes allowed <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to issue grants at their discretion, based on local economic needs. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were encouraged to support businesses from all sectors that were severely impacted by the pandemic but not eligible for other grant schemes, including those outside of the business rates system and supply chain firms. Figure 6 shows that discretionary scheme payments were highest in the Other Services sector at 30%. Twenty-six (26%) of payments were to smaller contributing sectors. Accommodation and Food services accounted for 17% of discretionary payments, Transportation and Storage for 14% and Arts, Entertainment and Recreation for 13%. The discretionary schemes provided significant funding to 10 different sectors (each receiving more than 1% of the total discretionary funding): see the accompanying data tables for more details.</p>

<h3>Business sizes</h3>

<p>The compliance rate for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> completing the ‘size’ field in the grant-level data overall was 71%, and 84% for the data collected in 2022. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were asked to complete this field according to the number of employees, using one of these 4 categories: micro (0 to 9 employees), small (10 to 49 employees), medium (50 to 249 employees) and large (more than 250 employees).</p>

<p>Where payment information provided did not contain a size (29% of the original data) we have removed these payments from the analysis presented here.</p>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 7 shows that the majority of reported payments went to micro businesses which received 80% of the grant payments by number, and a slightly lower amount of 73% by value. Small businesses received 14% by number, and a slightly higher amount of 18% by value, the same trend seen for both medium (2% and 4% respectively) and large (6% and 4% respectively) businesses. On average, smaller grant payments were given to micro businesses compared to other larger sizes, in line with the scheme guidance for targeted schemes, which allowed payment values proportional to property rateable values.</p>

<p>Micro, small, and medium sized businesses combined received 95% of the funding by value which equates to £21.3 billion of the total funding amount, with large businesses receiving £1.3 billion. Most schemes were explicitly targeted at smaller sized businesses, however, subject to subsidy allowance conditions, some large businesses, including those with more than one eligible premises, were also eligible for this funding.</p>

<p>The proportional stacked bar chart in Figure 8 shows that discretionary schemes gave proportionally fewer payments to businesses of larger sizes than targeted schemes. Small, medium and large sized businesses received 22% of targeted payments, with 78% being provided to micro businesses. Discretionary schemes provided 11% of payments to small, medium and large sized businesses, with 89% being provided to micro businesses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.&nbsp;Regional </span> observations</h2>

<p>There are 9 English regions which were established in 1994 and are set by the Government Statistical Service Regional and Geography Committee. Full data are available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/" rel="external">Open Geography Portal</a>.</p>

<h3>Allocation and payment variations between regions</h3>

<p><strong>Figure 9: The value of allocations and reported payments by region, all schemes, England</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Value of allocations and reported payments by region, all schemes, explained in text" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/158970/Figure9.svg"></div></figure>

<p>The bar chart in Figure 9 shows that reported spending by region largely reflects that of the allocation provided to the respective region. Funding allocations are broadly proportional to the calculated number of eligible businesses and are discussed in more detail in Section 2.</p>

<p>The London region had the largest total allocation at £4.23 billion and reported spending of £3.42 billion, which is 81% of allocation and the lowest of all regions.</p>

<p>The North East region had the lowest total allocation at £1.23 billion and reported spending of £1.07 billion which is 87% of allocation, the highest of all regions. This allocation proportion was also matched by the Yorkshire and the Humber region.</p>

<h3>Targeted and discretionary payment variations between regions</h3>

<p>The scaled bar chart in Figure 10 shows that the South West and Yorkshire and the Humber regions both reported the largest proportional spend on targeted schemes at 90%, but there was little variation across all regions, with the South East and London regions both reporting the smallest proportional spend on targeted schemes at 87%. The average targeted spend was 88%, with 12% being from discretionary schemes. These figures are also similar to the split of overall funding allocations, where 90% was provided as targeted and 10% as discretionary.</p>

<span class="number">6.&nbsp;The </span> <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr> scheme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr> scheme was the final scheme as part of the government’s <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 Grant Programme of support to businesses. It was announced in December 2021 alongside a third top-up to the <abbr title="Additional Restrictions Grant">ARG</abbr> scheme, to enable rapid support in response to the rise of the Omicron variant. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> were asked to increase reporting frequency to provide fortnightly grant-level data for all payments made through the scheme, with these data now being the only reporting requirement. The engagement rate was 90% for completion of the fortnightly data returns. Further insights using this fortnightly data are presented here.</p>

<p>Where payment information provided did not contain a valid date (1% of the original data) we have removed these payments from the analysis presented here. For this reason, comparison of monetary values between the aggregate and grant-level figures is not possible.</p>

<p>The line graph in Figure 11 shows the 7-day average reported payment values made under the <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr> scheme. The first reported payments were made on 4 January 2022, and the final payments on 31 March 2022, the end date of the scheme.</p>

<p>The average 7-day distribution of funding to businesses was over £60 million per day from 24 January 2022 to 12 February 2022, reaching a high of £73 million. This followed local authorities receiving their payment allocations in the first 2 weeks of January, with the scheme having been announced by the Chancellor on 21 December 2021.</p>

<p>In total, by 31 March 2022, £456 million had been reportedly paid to businesses, which is 72% of the total allocation of £635 million provided.</p>

<p>Payments were made to 309 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. The histogram in Figure 12 shows that 17 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have not reported <abbr title="Omicron Hospitality and Leisure Grant">OHLG</abbr> spend data. For the 292 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> where data were received, the percentage spending of allocation follows a normal distribution, with the majority of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, 188, reporting percentage spends of between 60% and 90%. 30 <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have reported spending over their allocation. Note that some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may not have provided all of their data returns and so the data may be incomplete, even from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> where data has been received. On completion of a full scheme reconciliation, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are provided with additional funds in the event that they had spent more than their indicative allocation to fund eligible businesses within targeted schemes. Unspent funding is returned to the Treasury.</p>

<h3>Status and use</h3>

<p>These insights are provided as transparency data only. They do not constitute an Official Statistics release. These data are published in order to provide further insights into the spending via the Business Grant schemes throughout the pandemic, and to provide transparency of the data that has been collected.</p>

<p>The data used in these insights have been self-reported by local authorities and collected by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>. Although some quality assurance has been carried out, it has not been possible to carry out full verification of the data provided. Not all authorities have provided all data for all schemes and, as such, the data are incomplete. This context should be considered when using the figures presented here.</p>

<p>These data cannot be used to draw insights into fraud or error within the schemes and they cannot be used to make judgements on the effectiveness of policy implementation, due to the limitations discussed above. The department has ongoing assurance activities to identify fraud and error and is undertaking an evaluation of the Grants Programme, which is expected to be completed in early 2023.</p>
