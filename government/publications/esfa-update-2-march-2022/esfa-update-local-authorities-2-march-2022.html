<p>We have not shown amounts for the tuition fund in 16 to 19 funding allocation statements for the academic year 2022 to 2023 because this is part of a separate process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: IFRS 16 leases implementation - impact on schools’ leasing activities</h2>

<p>Below sets out the Department for Education’s approach to the impact of IFRS 16 on schools’ leasing activities. Implementation for LA maintained schools will be subject to the outcome of the CIPFA consultation on delaying the implementation of IFRS 16 which closes at 23:00 on Thursday 3rd March 2022.</p>

<p>Currently, maintained schools and academies are generally free to take out operating leases, while finance leases require approval from the Secretary of State under the terms of the Education Act 2002 (maintained schools) and the Funding Agreement and Academies Trust Handbook (academies). The implementation of IFRS 16 will end the distinction between operating and finance leases and in effect, all leases will be classified as finance leases.</p>

<p>In response, DfE has worked with the sector to develop a new approach as we want to continue to allow maintained schools and academies to use leases to support their operation without additional administrative burdens.</p>

<p>The new approach involves giving the Secretary of State’s consent for particular classes of leased asset (listed below). Leases for items on this list will therefore not need to be submitted to the department for approval:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all existing leases already in place by 1 April 2022 (maintained schools) and 1 September 2022 (academies)</li>
  <li>IT equipment</li>
  <li>telephony</li>
  <li>catering equipment</li>
  <li>furniture</li>
  <li>bathroom/sanitary equipment</li>
  <li>gym equipment</li>
  <li>grounds keeping equipment</li>
  <li>minibuses and other vehicles for the use of the school</li>
  <li>temporary classrooms and equivalent structures</li>
</ul>

<p>The list will be kept under review following implementation and the relevant guidance and documents are being updated accordingly. Leases not included on the above list will need to be submitted for consent. We believe these will largely be leases in relation to land and buildings, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/submit-a-school-land-transaction-proposal">guidance can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
