<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 112</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the nearest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/france#organisations">British embassy or consulate in France</a>. Embassy staff will be polite, patient, sensitive and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reporting-the-incident-to-the-police-in-france">Reporting the incident to the police in France</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate they will try to send a consular officer to support you.</p>

<p>Consular staff can accompany you to the police station should you so wish and where possible.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British consulate.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or text messages.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable, although this will not be readily available in France.</p>

<p>The definition of rape (viol) in France is slightly different to the UK. More information is on <a rel="external" href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=F15068E7CC5A569A18E311420C6239F4.tpdjo05v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006165281&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&dateTexte=20131217">Legifrance website</a>. It is defined as “any act of sexual penetration, whatever the type, upon a third party, through violence, threats or surprise”. In French: “tout acte de pénétration sexuelle, de quelque nature qu’il soit, commis sur la personne d’autrui par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise”.</p>

<p>Sexual assault (agression sexuelle) is defined as: “any sexual infringement carried out using violence, coercion, threats or surprise”. In French: “toute atteinte sexuelle commise avec violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise”.</p>

<p>Where possible a female officer will be in attendance but this might not always be possible depending on the police station or town.</p>

<p>The British embassy has received feedback from some rape victims that they have found the process of reporting the assault at times difficult, and quite different from what they would expect of UK police proceedings.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-do-not-want-to-report-the-incident-to-the-police-in-france">If you do not want to report the incident to the police in France</h3>

<p>The British embassy or consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and provide you with information on local support in the UK. They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/france-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators</a>.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence. You have to report the crime in-country for it to be investigated.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime, you will still be able to get medical attention and you should go to the nearest hospital or a local doctor, gynaecologist or local family planning centre.</p>

<p>You can ask for forensic evidence to be taken even if you do not wish to report the crime immediately. It is important that this is done within 72 hours.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-the-incident-to-the-police-in-the-uk">Reporting the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK but it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas.</p>

<p>Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally.</p>

<p>For more information, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">read our advice on returning to the UK after rape and sexual assault abroad</a></p>

<h2 id="reporting-the-crime-in-france">Reporting the crime in France</h2>

<p>The initial reporting of the incident and the first interviews by the police may be done by a non-specialised officer, before a specially-trained officer takes over. In smaller towns there may not be a specialised officer. In larger towns, you may be escorted or have to travel to another police station.</p>

<p>If you need an interpreter the police will provide one, though there is no guarantee of quality. This translation may be done over the phone. In some cases, a conference call can be arranged between you, the police and a translator. A consular officer may be permitted to attend at the discretion of the police officer. If an interpreter is required in person, there may be a delay while one is found.</p>

<p>You may be referred to the local medico-legal unit, usually at a hospital. Where possible and if you want to, consular staff will accompany you.</p>

<p>Once an initial verbal report is made to the police, you will be required to give a full statement (déposition). You will be given a copy of the proceedings (known as a procès verbal).</p>

<h2 id="the-medical-examination--what-to-expect">The medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<p>All hospitals and medical centres treat victims of rape and sexual assault. You can have a forensic examination at hospital and later report the crime to the police. If you do not wish to report the crime, you can have a medical examination at a hospital or family planning centre, though forensic evidence will not be collected.</p>

<p>A forensic examination is known as SAS (Set d’Agression Sexuelle) and is carried out by a doctor. Samples or swabs will be taken from clothes, the mouth, hair and there will be a gynaecological examination. This is undertaken by specially-trained medical staff.</p>

<p>Consular staff can accompany you to the hospital should you so wish and where possible. Tour operators may accompany you or any other person of your choice.</p>

<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>

<p>If it is possible that you may have been exposed to the HIV virus, you should go to a hospital urgently to obtain “Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)”, a treatment than may stop HIV replicating in the body and so prevent the virus from attacking the immune system (Traitement Post Exposition - TPE). This can be prescribed at any hospital. More information on risks is available on the <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/HIV">NHS website</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK</li>
  <li>emergency contraception can be obtained from a pharmacy.  It can be given free with or without a prescription or bought over the counter</li>
  <li>emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective</li>
  <li>if you have had medication administered whilst overseas keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication and let you local health provider know</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="police-investigations-in-france--what-to-expect">Police investigations in France – what to expect</h2>

<p>French judicial procedures come under the responsibility of the Public Prosecutor (Procureur de la République) at the local High Court (Tribunal de Grande Instance). The Police will remain in contact with the Public Prosecutor throughout their investigation.</p>

<p>Once the initial police investigation is completed, the Public Prosecutor will decide one of several options open to them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they can order a trial immediately, under the fast track system (comparution immediate). They will do this if they have overwhelming evidence – for example, if the suspect has confessed</li>
  <li>they can file the case (classement sans suite). This does not mean that they have decided that nothing happened, but that they do not have sufficient grounds or evidence to prosecute</li>
  <li>they can order a further investigation and nominate an Examining Magistrate (Juge d’Instruction) to continue the investigation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="court-procedures--what-to-expect">Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<p>If an Examining Magistrate is appointed, you may be summoned to an interview at the court.  This may include a “confrontation” as it may occur at the police station: this would involve you being in the same room as your aggressor, and the Examining Magistrate will put questions to each of you. This could be at a later date and after your return to the UK.</p>

<p>If you so wish, consular staff will accompany you to the court at this time, although they may not be allowed to enter the magistrate’s office.</p>

<p>When the Examining Magistrate has completed their investigation, the case will either be filed (non lieu) or sent to trial.</p>

<p>Victims of crime in France are not automatically part of the judicial process. At any point in the judicial process, up to the first day of any trial, you may apply to become an interested party (Partie Civile). For this you should write to the Examining Magistrate explaining why you want to apply – the victim support network (Aide aux Victimes) INAVEM may be able to help you with this process.</p>

<p>You do not have to become an interested party, but you should be aware that if you are not, you will have no have access to the progress of the case and you will not be entitled to claim any compensation.</p>

<p>If the Examining Magistrate decides the case is to be taken to court, you will need to engage a lawyer to represent you. The cost of this may be covered by travel or household insurance (see the section on legal aid below). You will generally need to be present at the court to give evidence.</p>

<p>If you do not speak French, a translator will be provided by the court and you should inform them of this requirement in advance to allow them to make suitable arrangements. Consular staff will not normally be able to attend the trial with you. You may wish to be accompanied by a friend or member of your family for the court hearing.</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>Your lawyer will keep you updated and will be in direct contact with the Examining magistrate and the court.  You do not need a French address. Any correspondence will be sent to the address you provide to the court and your lawyer.</p>

<h2 id="legal-aid">Legal aid</h2>

<p>British nationals who have court cases in France, and are unable to engage the services of a lawyer privately, are entitled to apply for legal aid (aide juridictionelle). Legal aid can be either full or partial, depending mainly on the applicant’s income and family circumstances. More information is at <a rel="external" href="http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F18074.xhtml%5D">http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F18074.xhtml</a> or speak to a consular officer.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, and for the most serious crimes (including rape but not sexual assault), full legal aid is not subject to any means test. You will still need to apply, and your lawyer must agree to accept legal aid (if necessary, the court can supply a list of lawyers who do accept legal aid, or the head of the local law society (batonnier de l’ordre des avocats) can appoint a lawyer for you). You may request an English-speaking lawyer but this is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>If you are in France, you should apply to the Public Prosecutor (Procureur de la Republique) at the High Court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) in the district where you live. The full procedure and the application form are available at <a rel="external" href="http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F18074.xhtml">http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F18074.xhtml</a></p>

<p>If you are in the United Kingdom, you may apply for legal aid in the same way as if the legal action contemplated were in the UK. The European Agreement on the Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid, to which both the UK and France are parties, provides that each party shall have one or more transmitting authorities to forward applications for legal aid to the appropriate foreign authority. The transmitting authorities for the United Kingdom are the Legal Services Commission (England and Wales), the Scottish Legal Aid Central Committee (Scotland), and the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland (N. Ireland).</p>

<h2 id="compensation">Compensation</h2>

<p>Compensation (dommages et interets) is usually given as part of any sentence. Your lawyer will guide you on the level of compensation to claim for and how to submit this before the trial.</p>

<p>If the guilty party cannot pay you compensation there is a state-funded compensation scheme which may cover some of it (Commission d’indemnisation des victimes d’infra-ctions (CIVI)).  Your lawyer or the victims support agency INAVEM will be able to give you details on how to apply and what to expect.</p>

<h2 id="when-you-return-home-to-the-uk">When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually-transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in.</p>

<h2 id="support-organisations-in-france">Support organisations in France</h2>

<p>It is your choice to let people know. If you are ready to talk about it the following organisations may be able to help you.</p>

<h3 id="institut-national-daide-aux-victimes-et-de-mdiation-inavem">Institut National d’Aide aux Victimes et de Médiation (INAVEM)</h3>

<p>INAVEM France can advise and help victims and/or their close relatives and guide them through some aspects of the judicial process. They can also help with claims for compensation. They do not take the place of a lawyer as they do not have access to the judicial file. There is a branch of INAVEM attached to each Tribunal de Grande Instance and address and telephone details can be obtained from the court.</p>
