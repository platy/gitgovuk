<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Change to the Employment Allowance</h2>

<p>Since 6 April 2015, employers of care and support workers can claim the Employment Allowance. This means you can reduce your Employer National Insurance contributions bill by up to £3,000 in the tax years 2016 to 2020, £4,000 from 2020 to 2022 and £5,000 from 6 April 2022, depending on how much employer National Insurance contributions you pay.</p>

<p>The Employment Allowance is not a grant, it works by reducing the amount of employer National Insurance contributions you need to pay.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Employing a care and support worker</h2>

<p>You can claim the Employment Allowance if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re an employer and you pay employer National Insurance contributions</li>
  <li>you employ a care and support worker and pay for this yourself from your own funds, either for yourself or another person — if for someone else, you do not need to be related to them or live with them</li>
  <li>you receive a direct payment for the care from the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> or your local authority and you use this to employ care and support worker — this type of care worker is sometimes known as a personal assistant</li>
  <li>you’ve sustained an injury and need to employ a care and support worker for yourself until you recover</li>
  <li>you employ a care and support worker to look after your disabled child if the care is due to their disability</li>
  <li>your disability means that you need support so that you can care for your children</li>
  <li>
    <p>the person you’re employing the care and support worker for, needs care because of their:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>mental or physical disability</li>
      <li>past or present dependence on alcohol or drugs</li>
      <li>past or present illness</li>
      <li>past or present mental disorder</li>
      <li>long term health condition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can only claim one Employment Allowance. The allowance is per employer, not per staff member. Each employer can reduce their employer National Insurance contributions bill by up to £5,000 from 6 April 2022, no matter how many staff they employ.</p>

<p>In addition, all of the duties of the care and support worker have to be in relation to the individual who needs care. You can claim the Employment Allowance for as long as the person needs care. The care and support worker cannot help out with others in the home who do not need care.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Duties of the care and support worker</h3>

<p>The care and support worker can do anything that you need help with. This could be anything from personal care to general assistance round the house with cleaning, cooking and laundry, or help with financial administration such as tax credits.</p>

<p>The care can be provided anywhere, so you can employ a carer to support family or friends who do not live with you and claim the Employment Allowance. The care does not need to be provided in the home, so you can employ a carer to help at work, accompany you to day care or appointments and claim the Employment Allowance.</p>

<p>You cannot claim the Employment Allowance if you are employing a nanny unless the nanny is employed for an individual who needs care.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to claim the Employment Allowance</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>File HMRC returns online</h3>

<p>You’ll need to tick the box to confirm you’re eligible on your payroll software. Your payroll software will automatically apply the Employment Allowance and reduce your employer secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions bill.</p>

<p>To claim through your payroll software, put ‘Yes’ in the ‘Employment Allowance indicator’ field next time you send an Employment Payment Summary (<abbr title="Employment Payment Summary">EPS</abbr>) to HMRC.</p>

<p>If you use HMRC’s Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select the correct name in the ‘Employer’ menu on the home page</li>
  <li>select ‘Change employer details’</li>
  <li>select ‘Yes’ in the ‘Employment Allowance indicator’ field</li>
  <li>input your business sector or choose ‘state aid rules do not apply’ if you business does not undertake economic activity</li>
  <li>send your <abbr title="Employment Payment Summary">EPS</abbr> as normal</li>
</ul>

<p>You only need to claim Employment Allowance once within a tax year.</p>

<p>If you stop being eligible, select ‘No’ in the ‘Employment Allowance indicator’ field in your payroll records. Not all payroll software can send <abbr title="Employment Payment Summary">EPS</abbr> reports. If this is the case, you can use HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/basic-paye-tools">Basic <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Tools</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>File HMRC returns on paper</h3>

<p>To claim the Employment Allowance on paper, tick the box on form RT5 (Employment Payment Summary) where it asks whether you wish to claim the Employment Allowance. You’ll need to tick this box every time you send in an RT5. You will also need to subtract the value of the allowance from your employer National Insurance contributions liability before you make a payment.</p>

<p>You can either spread the allowance over the year or deduct it all in one go, if you have sufficient employer National Insurance contributions liability.</p>
