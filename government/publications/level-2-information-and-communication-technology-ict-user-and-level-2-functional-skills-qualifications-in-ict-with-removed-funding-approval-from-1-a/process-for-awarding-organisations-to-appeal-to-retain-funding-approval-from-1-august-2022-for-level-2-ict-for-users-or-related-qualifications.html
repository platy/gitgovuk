<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This guidance sets out the process and timescales through which you (awarding organisations) can notify us if you believe a level 2 Information Communication and Technology (ICT) for Users or related qualification should remain approved for public funding for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>Alongside this guidance, we have published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1057925/ICT_level_2_defunding_list__1_.xlsx" rel="external">initial list of level 2 qualifications</a> that are in scope to have funding approval for new starts removed from 1 August 2022. These qualifications are in the Sector Subject Area (SSA) ICT for Users or are related level 2 qualifications in other SSAs that share similar characteristics.</p>

<p>Where we remove funding approval from a qualification, we will also remove funding approval from any components (units) of that qualification if they are approved for the ESFA-funded adult education budget (AEB) local flexibility offer.</p>

<p>You may appeal against the initial decision to remove funding approval from ICT for Users and related qualifications if you believe the qualification meets the appeals criteria set out in this guidance.</p>

<p>If you believe a qualification on the list of ICT for Users and related qualifications in scope for removal of funding approval from 1 August 2022 should remain approved for funding for 2022 to 2023, you may submit an appeal. Qualifications in scope for this notification process are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualifications at level 2 which are in the Sector Subject Area (SSA) ICT for Users</li>
  <li>qualifications at level 2 which are not in SSA ICT for Users but in their content, assessment and outcomes share characteristics of and/or are similar to level 2 qualifications in the SSA</li>
</ul>

<p>We have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1056995/ICT_for_users_Digital_defunding_appeal_form.docx" rel="external">published a form</a> you will need to complete and return to us if you want to submit an appeal.</p>

<p>We will consider appeals to retain a qualification in the SSA ICT for Users where the qualification meets the criteria <a class="govuk-link" href="#retain">set out in this guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that appeals to retain a qualification for funding approval must be submitted by 11:59am on Friday 8 April 2022.</p>

<p>Where we agree to retain a qualification for funding approval, the qualification remains in scope for the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-post-16-qualifications-at-level-2-and-below">review of post-16 qualifications at level 2 and below in England</a>.</p>

<p>We have also published a list of level 2 Functional Skills Qualifications (FSQs) in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) which are in the SSA Foundations for learning and life. These qualifications will also have funding approval for new starts removed from 1 August 2022.</p>

<p>FSQs in ICT at level 2 are out of scope of the appeals process. This is because the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/796173/Improving_adult_basic_digital_skills_-_government_consultation_response.pdf" rel="external">governmentâs response to reforming adult basic digital skills</a> has confirmed that these qualifications, including new digital FSQs will be at entry and level 1 only. Therefore, please note that you cannot submit an appeal to retain funding approval for these qualifications.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A digital entitlement for adults with low or no digital skills was introduced in August 2020, supported by new Essential Digital Skills Qualifications (EDSQs). New digital FSQs at entry and level 1 will be developed and will replace existing FSQs in ICT from August 2023.</p>

<p>As part of these reforms to basic digital skills qualifications, we confirmed that from 1 August 2021, we would remove funding approval for students aged 16 and over from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all qualifications up to and including level 1 in the SSA ICT for Users</li>
  <li>digital and ICT qualifications up to and including level 1 in other SSAs that were not linked to the application of digital skills for a specific occupational sector, or specific entry level job role</li>
</ul>

<p>This is in order that funding can be focussed on qualifications aligned to the national standards for the basic digital skills needed for life and work.</p>

<p>We published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ict-and-digital-qualifications-with-removed-funding-approval">list of those qualifications where funding approval was removed from 1 August 2021</a> for students aged 16 and over. We also highlighted in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualification-funding-approval">qualifications funding approval manual for 2021 to 2022</a> that we would be reviewing the date for any withdrawal of funding approval for students aged 16 and over from existing FSQs in ICT.</p>

<p>Alongside this guidance, government has published a consultation on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-post-16-qualifications-at-level-2-and-below">review of post-16 qualifications at level 2 and below in England</a>. This includes the government response to the consultation on proposals to remove post-16 funding approval from level 2 digital qualifications, which was carried out as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/post-16-study-at-level-2-and-below-call-for-evidence">call for evidence on post-16 level 2 and below study and qualifications</a>.</p>

<p>In the response, government confirms that it will proceed with the proposal to remove funding approval from level 2 FSQs for ICT and level 2 ICT for Users qualifications.</p>

<p>FSQs in ICT at entry level and level 1 will remain available and approved for funding until 1 August 2023, when they will be replaced by new digital FSQs at entry and level 1.</p>

<h2>Offers in scope</h2>

<p>The following Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) funded offers are in scope for funding approval removal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>16 to 19 study programmes</li>
  <li>ESFA funded adult education budget (AEB), including local flexibility</li>
  <li>European Social Fund (ESF)</li>
</ul>

<p>This will not affect funding approval where the qualifications are taken by students aged 14 to 16 (at Key Stage 4), as part of a traineeship, or as part of an apprenticeship. The qualifications will remain available in these offers.</p>

<h2>Definition of ICT for Users and related qualifications</h2>

<p>We have defined a qualification as a level 2 ICT User and related qualification if the following is met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the qualification is at level 2</li>
  <li>the qualification is either:
    <ul>
      <li>in the SSA ICT for Users or</li>
      <li>in another SSA but has a similar purpose, content, and outcomes to a qualification in the ICT for Users SSA</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the qualification is approved for some or all of the 2021 to 2022 funding year as part of the 16 to 19, ESFA funded AEB local flexibility or ESF qualifications offers</li>
</ul>

<p>We have not included a qualification if funding approval has already been confirmed as being withdrawn from 1 August 2022 as a result of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdrawal-of-funding-approval-from-qualifications-with-low-and-no-publicly-funded-enrolments-for-the-funding-year-2022-to-2023">review of qualifications with low and no publicly funded enrolments</a>.</p>

<h2>Definition of Functional Skills Qualifications</h2>

<p>We have defined a qualification as a Functional Skills Qualification in ICT if the following is met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the qualification is at level 2</li>
  <li>the qualification is in SSA Foundations for learning</li>
  <li>the qualification type is Functional Skills</li>
  <li>the qualification title is Functional Skills Qualification in Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</li>
  <li>the qualification is approved for some or all of the 2021 to 2022 funding year as part of 16 to 19, ESFA funded AEB local flexibility, or ESF qualification offers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requests to retain funding approval</h2>

<p>You may appeal against the decision to remove funding approval from 1 August 2022 for either a level 2 qualification in ICT for Users, or a level 2 qualification in another SSA which appears on the initial published list.</p>

<p>We will not accept appeals for FSQs in ICT at level 2. This is because the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/796173/Improving_adult_basic_digital_skills_-_government_consultation_response.pdf" rel="external">governmentâs response to reforming adult basic digital skills</a> has confirmed that these qualifications, including new digital FSQs, will be at entry level and level 1 only.</p>

<p>You may only appeal the initial decision to remove funding approval if the qualification is linked to a specific occupational sector or a specific entry level job role in that sector.</p>

<p>You must provide evidence that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the qualification is occupational in nature and supports direct entry level employment in a job role</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to appeal, you must do so by 11:59am on <strong>Friday 8 April 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>You must use the published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1049636/ICT_for_users_Digital_defunding_appeal_form.docx" rel="external">form</a> (and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1049640/2022_Summary_of_Appeals_Form.xlsx" rel="external">summary form</a>) to submit an appeal on and email the completed form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Qualifications.ESFA@education.gov.uk">Qualifications.ESFA@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will review all appeals submitted and reserve the right to seek additional or external advice if necessary. We will communicate the outcome of submitted appeals before we publish the final list of level 2 ICT for Users and related qualifications where funding will be removed from 1 August 2022. We will publish the list no later than Friday 29 April 2022.</p>

<p>Where we decide to uphold your appeal, we will ask you to review the SSA you have assigned the qualification to and consider whether it is the appropriate SSA.</p>

<p>All our decisions for appeals will be final.</p>

<h2>Acceptable evidence</h2>

<p>You may also submit appropriate additional information to support your appeal. This evidence may be from users of the qualifications including education and training providers, employers, and representative bodies as appropriate. We would not expect evidence from students undertaking the qualifications. Evidence must directly relate to the qualification you are appealing against, setting out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how and why the qualification supports a specific occupational sector or entry level job role</li>
  <li>which job role the qualification supports</li>
  <li>how the qualification supports progression to that job role</li>
</ul>

<p>Your evidence must be current, and we must be able to validate it (for example, evidence should include name, designation and address linked to any supporting evidence).</p>

<p>Evidence in the form of letters supporting either the regulation of the qualification, or from providers of education and training setting out current and likely demand, will not be accepted.</p>

<p>We will only accept appeals from the awarding organisation that offers the qualification. We will not accept appeals from providers of education and training, or others.</p>

<p>You must provide us with a single notification for each qualification you are appealing against.
We will send you an email confirming that we have received your appeal. Please note that emails may be rejected due to size restrictions (25 MB maximum). If we have not told you that we have received your notification within three working days, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Qualifications.ESFA@education.gov.uk">Qualifications.ESFA@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will not accept late submission of forms, evidence, or other supporting information.</p>

<p>Where we remove funding approval for a qualification, there is no facility for that qualification to re-enter the publicly funded offer.</p>

<p>We will also not approve new qualifications that are replicas of (or similar to) qualifications where funding approval has already been withdrawn.</p>

<p>We will amend our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualification-funding-approval/other-approval-principles-reviewing-qualifications-during-the-moratorium">current moratorium</a> on approving some newly regulated qualifications for funding as type 3 (new qualifications developed in response to economic need) and type 4 (qualifications that we have already approved for funding but which need updating) exemptions to the moratorium. We will not approve the following qualifications for funding from 1 August 2022 as exemptions to the moratorium:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualifications in SSA ICT for Users at level 2</li>
  <li>qualifications in other SSAs at level 2 which have content, assessment and purpose linked to basic digital skills</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any queries relating to this guidance, please email us at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Qualifications.ESFA@education.gov.uk">Qualifications.ESFA@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
