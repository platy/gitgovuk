<p>The following text has the force of law by virtue of Regulation 30(2) of the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>The cases specified for the purposes of regulation 30(2) of the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (Customs declaration to which the simplified Customs declaration process does not apply) are declarations of goods for a free zone procedure in the circumstances specified in either point 1 or point 2.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where acceptance of that declaration to a free zone procedure by HMRC will discharge another special Customs procedure (as defined at section 3(4) of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where all the following circumstances apply:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>the simplified Customs declaration to a free zone procedure would be made using the <abbr title="Entry In Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> procedure (as defined at section 36(1) of the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018</li>
  <li>the goods are not, at the time of the declaration for a free zone procedure, subject to any other Customs procedure, and</li>
  <li>the goods are one of the categories listed at (i), (ii) or (iii)</li>
</ul>

<p>i) Prohibited or restricted goods within the meaning at section 1(1) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.<br><br>
ii) Goods which, if declared for the free-circulation procedure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>would be subject to an additional amount of import duty under section 13, 14 or 15 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, or</li>
  <li>the importer of the goods would be required to give a guarantee under paragraph 15(5) of Schedule 4 to that Act
<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>iii)  Excise goods within the meaning of regulation 3 of the Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010.</p>

<h2>Information note (this text will not have force of law)</h2>

<p>Amendments to customs legislation from 1 July 2022 will permit the use of simplified customs declaration procedures for a declaration to the free zone customs procedure, other than in circumstances specified in a Public Notice published by HMRC.</p>

<p>The effects of that Public Notice are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to not permit the use of simplified customs declaration procedures where a prior declaration to a customs special procedure has already been made in respect of the goods</li>
  <li>where a prior declaration to a customs special procedure has not been made, to not permit the use of the Entry In Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry In Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>) form of simplified custom declaration procedures where the goods are controlled goods (including excise goods) and goods which are subject to trade remedies</li>
</ul>
