<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Summary of changes</h2>

<p>We have updated this guidance to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide guidance on the arrangements for the early years foundation stage profile (<abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr>) assessment in 2021, which will not be mandatory but which providers will be required to use ‘best endeavours’ to complete (sections 2.1, 2.3, 4.2, 6.2)</li>
  <li>provide guidance on what to do if paediatric first aid (<abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr>) certificate requalification training is prevented for reasons associated directly with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, or by complying with related government advice (section 7.2)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/596629/EYFS_STATUTORY_FRAMEWORK_2017.pdf" rel="external">early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>) statutory framework</a> sets the standards that all early years providers must meet to ensure that children aged 0 to 5 learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe.</p>

<p>To support early years providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the government is allowing providers to use temporary disapplications and modifications to certain elements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> where government imposed restrictions impact on a provider’s ability to deliver the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>. The specific disapplications and modifications are set out in sections 5 to 7.</p>

<p>This is to allow providers greater flexibility to respond to changes in workforce availability and potential fluctuations in demand, while still providing care that is high quality and safe. Further detail on how providers will be inspected from January 2021 can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsteds-plans-2021">Ofsted’s operational notes</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Timeline</h3>

<h4>April 2020</h4>

<p>The original disapplications came into force on 24 April 2020 and ended on 25 September 2020 (with a 2-month transitional period to 25 November 2020 for disapplications around staff qualifications to be counted in ratios and paediatric first aid (<abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr>)).</p>

<h4>September 2020</h4>

<p>Updated arrangements were put in place from 26 September 2020 until 31 August 2021 to allow providers to use the specific disapplications and modifications if any local or national government agreed coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions impact their ability to deliver the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>. This is described in more detail in paragraph 2.2.</p>

<h4>January 2021</h4>
<p>In light of the national coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions, where schools should only allow vulnerable children and children of critical workers to attend, the Secretary of State for Education decided it will not be mandatory for practitioners to complete the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (<abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr>) assessment in 2021. Instead, we will be asking schools to use their best endeavours to undertake it, should the situation at the time allow. This decision is subject to the parliamentary process. Further detail is set out in section 6.2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Local or national restrictions</h3>

<p>Restrictions or requirements related to coronavirus (COVID-19), for example, due to a local or national lockdown, may affect a provider’s ability to comply with the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>. Therefore, the arrangements that came into force on 26 September 2020 allow the disapplications to be used where a provider is prevented from complying with the requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> due to coronavirus (COVID-19) related restrictions or requirements which have been imposed by regulations or a direction.</p>

<p>These restrictions must have been implemented either through the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 or under the Coronavirus Act 2020.</p>

<p>For the disapplications to apply, both of the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there must be government restrictions and requirements in place</li>
  <li>the provider must have deemed these restrictions to mean they are unable to deliver the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> as required</li>
</ul>

<p>A provider would not be able to use the disapplications simply due to an incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) in their setting. However, if a number of staff are required to self-isolate (under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984), and if this is significant enough to impact on a provider’s ability to deliver the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, the disapplications can be used.</p>

<p>The provider does not need to be located in the geographical area where the restrictions are applied, but the restrictions do need to prevent them from complying with the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, for example, because their staff live in the area where the restrictions apply and are not able to get into work.</p>

<p>All providers should use their best endeavours to complete the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> assessment in 2021, but this will not be mandatory.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Definitions</h3>

<p>These provisions under the latest regulations will be referred to in this guidance as a ‘period of intervention’.</p>

<p>‘Prescribed requirements’ refer to the specific parts of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> that can be disapplied, including the learning and development requirements, the progress check at age 2 and requirements around <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> qualifications and staff qualifications and ratios.</p>

<p>The term ‘reasonable endeavours’ has been used for the learning and development requirements and welfare requirements relating to staff qualification levels. For the <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> requirement, ‘best endeavours’ has been used. ‘Best endeavours’ is a higher-level requirement than ‘reasonable endeavours’ and is used here to ensure meeting the <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> requirements take priority over the other areas of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> framework that have been changed.</p>

<p>The term ‘best endeavours’ has also been used for the requirement to complete the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (<abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr>) in 2021. This is because the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> is an important tool for supporting children’s development and the transition from reception to year 1 and practitioners should prioritise undertaking this assessment if this is possible by the summer term.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Further guidance</h3>

<p>Details of restrictions or requirements that might be imposed are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/containing-and-managing-local-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreaks/covid-19-contain-framework-a-guide-for-local-decision-makers" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 contain framework</a> and include restrictions on local or national transport systems or general restrictions on the movement of people, including requirements to ‘stay at home’ or restrictions on entering or leaving a defined area.</p>

<p>This guidance note outlines the arrangements in relation to elements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> that have been disapplied. It should be read alongside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures" class="govuk-link">actions for early years and childcare providers during coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic guidance</a> and any guidance from the providers’ local authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Who is this for?</h2>

<p>The disapplications and modifications to the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> are for all early years providers in England, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained schools</li>
  <li>non-maintained schools</li>
  <li>independent schools (including free schools and academies)</li>
  <li>all providers on Ofsted’s Early Years Register</li>
  <li>all providers registered with an early years childminder agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>When do these changes apply?</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Regulations from 26 September 2020</h3>

<p>The updated disapplications cover the period between 26 September 2020 and 31 August 2021. If during this time the government confirms that an area will be subject to coronavirus (COVID-19) related requirements or restrictions (referred to in here as the period of intervention related to coronavirus), and those restrictions prevent an early years provider from meeting the requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, the disapplications can be used. These will begin immediately and will last throughout the period of the restrictions (as governed by the regulations or direction). There will be a 2 week transition period once the relevant restrictions are lifted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Early Years Foundation Stage Profile assessment</h3>
<p>The Secretary of State for Education has decided that the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (<abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr>) assessment will not be mandatory in 2021, but we will require providers to use their best endeavours to complete it and provide the information to year 1 teachers and to parents if this is possible. The <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> will be disapplied and a best endeavours requirement introduced for the academic year 2020 to 2021 only.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Disapplications for the early years foundation stage section 1</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Learning and development requirements</h3>

<h4>The change</h4>

<p>During any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19), early years providers should use reasonable endeavours to meet the existing learning and development requirements, instead of this being something they ‘must do’.</p>

<h4>What this means in practice</h4>

<p>The most important thing is that children are cared for and are safe within settings. As far as possible, children should also benefit from a broad range of educational opportunities.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements comprise 7 high level areas of learning that ordinarily must shape education programmes in settings, and 17 early learning goals (<abbr title="early learning goals">ELGs</abbr>) which summarise the knowledge, skills and understanding that all children should have gained by the end of the reception year.</p>

<p>Providers should try and meet existing requirements as far as is possible, although we recognise that these are extraordinary times and there may be occasions where it will not be possible to provide activities and experience across all 7 areas of learning for all children all of the time. It is not reasonable for providers to do nothing.</p>

<p>Further detail on how providers will be inspected from January 2021 can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsteds-plans-2021">Ofsted’s operational notes</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Disapplications for the early years foundation stage section 2</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Assessment - progress check at age 2</h3>

<h4>The change</h4>

<p>The progress check at age 2 will not need to be undertaken during any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h4>What this means in practice</h4>

<p>Providers would normally need to undertake a progress check when a child is aged between 2 and 3. This provides parents and carers with a short, written summary of their child’s development in the prime areas.</p>

<p>Where the criteria at paragraph 2.2 are met, there is no requirement for providers to undertake this check, but providers should still remain alert to any emerging concerns about any child in their care, and endeavour to provide or seek additional support if needed. It is expected that the checks will take place as soon as is practical once the child returns to, or joins, the early years setting, including where a child has turned 3 if it is considered appropriate and useful in the provider’s professional judgement and in discussion with the child’s parents or carers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Assessment – early years foundation stage profile</h3>

<h4>The change</h4>

<p>The early years foundation stage profile (<abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr>) assessment was not undertaken in the academic year 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>In January 2021, in light of the introduction of new national restrictions, where schools should allow vulnerable children and children of critical workers to attend, the Secretary of State for Education decided that it will not be mandatory to complete the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> assessment in 2021. However, we will be requiring schools to use ‘best endeavours’ to undertake it. As at January 2021, this decision is still subject to parliamentary process.</p>

<h4>What this means in practice</h4>
<p>The decision that the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> will not be mandatory in 2021 is in recognition of the additional pressures, and uncertainties, that teachers are facing during this challenging time and aligns with the approach taken for other statutory assessments this year.</p>

<p>However, we recognise that the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> is a valued assessment by teachers and early years professionals and is a crucial tool in supporting children’s development and the transition from reception to year 1. It is for that reason we are requiring teachers and early years practitioners to use their best endeavours to still complete the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> for children in the summer term, if at all possible, and to provide this important information to parents and to year 1 teachers, should the situation at the time allow.</p>

<p>This will be a judgement for schools and teachers depending on their individual circumstances and will, in many cases, depend on the coming weeks and months. Schools who decide they are able to complete the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> this year and provide this information to parents and year 1 teachers will not be subject to statutory external moderation. There will be no requirement to submit data to the local authority or to confirm whether they have completed the <abbr title="early years foundation stage profile">EYFSP</abbr> to the Department for Education.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Disapplications for the early years foundation stage section 3</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Staff qualification and ratios</h3>

<h4>The change</h4>

<p>Ratio requirements stay the same in the majority of cases (see <a href="#nurseryschools" class="govuk-link">maintained nursery schools</a> for the only exception) but, during any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19), exceptions can be made to the qualifications that staff hold in order to be counted in the ratio requirements. Providers should use reasonable endeavours to ensure that at least half of staff (excluding the manager) hold at least a full and relevant level 2 qualification to meet staff: child ratio requirements, but this will not be a legal requirement.</p>

<h4>What this means in practice</h4>

<p>Ratio requirements remain the same, except for maintained school nursery classes with no school teacher, with the existing flexibility set out at paragraph 3.30 of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>: ‘Exceptionally, and where the quality of care and safety and security of children is maintained, changes to the ratios may be made.’</p>

<p>Providers still need to ensure that there is always a member of staff in a setting which is open and providing care, who holds at least a full and relevant level 3 qualification.</p>

<p>We expect providers to try and meet existing requirements for staff at level 2 as far as is possible. For example, if staff with level 2 qualifications are available, they should work with the children. However, we recognise that there may be occasions where staff absence due to the impacts of coronavirus (COVID-19) means this is not possible.</p>

<p>The qualifications of staff depend on the type of setting and the numbers of staff: child ratios in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>. These are set out in the section on <a href="#staffratios" class="govuk-link">staff qualifications and ratios during any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Paediatric first aid</h3>

<p>Providers remain responsible for ensuring all children in their care are kept safe at all times.</p>

<h4>The changes</h4>

<p>The requirement for at least one person who has a full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate to be on the premises at all times when children are present remains in place at all times where there are children below the age of 24 months. Paragraph 3.25 and annex A of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> set out more detail.</p>

<p>During any period of intervention relating to coronavirus (COVID-19), if children are aged 2 to 5 within a setting, providers must use their ‘best endeavours’ to ensure one person with a full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate is on site when children are present. If after using best endeavours they are still unable to secure a member of staff with full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> to be on site then they must carry out a written risk assessment and ensure that someone with a current first aid at work or emergency <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certification is on site at all times children are on premises.</p>

<p>Please note that this change does not apply for childminders, who must already have a full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate as part of registration requirements.</p>

<p>‘Best endeavours’ means to identify and take all the steps possible within your power, which could, if successful, ensure there is a paediatric first aider on site when a setting is open, as per the usual <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> requirement on <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>New entrants (levels 2 and 3) will not need to hold a <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate within their first 3 months in order to be counted in staff: child ratios, during any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h4>Requalification</h4>

<p>Additionally, if <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate requalification training is prevented for reasons associated directly with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, or by complying with related government advice, the validity of current certificates can be extended to 31 March 2021 at the latest. This applies to certificates expiring on or after 1 October 2020 and includes paediatric first aiders in provision registered on the General Childcare Register as well as Ofsted registered early years provision. Childminders can also apply this extension.</p>

<p>If asked to do so, providers should be able to explain why the first aider has not been able to requalify and demonstrate what steps have taken to access the training. Employers or certificate holders must do their best to arrange requalification training at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Practitioners are strongly encouraged to use online resources to refresh their knowledge of Paediatric First Aid procedures if they need to extend their certificates while waiting to access face-to-face training. Providers such as St John Ambulance offer free online resources to support this.</p>

<p>The practical elements of <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> courses should be delivered face to face, so that competency can be properly assessed, as set out in Annex A of the statutory framework for the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>What this means in practice</h4>

<p>For providers with children below the age of 24 months in their care, the requirements around <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> remain the same as in the current <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> framework at all times. This is in recognition of the greater risk factors for babies and young children in this age bracket, including choking risks and different cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) procedures for those aged 0 to 1 as set out by the NHS.</p>

<p>During any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID 19), new entrants do not need to have a <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate to be counted in ratios.</p>

<p>Also, for providers who have children aged 2 to 5 in their care, they must use ‘best endeavours’ to have one person with full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr>, as set out in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, on site. By best endeavours, we mean providers must be able to demonstrate they have identified and taken all the steps possible to appoint a suitable person.</p>

<p>This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>liaising with their local authority to find a suitable person, this could include identifying and looking to appoint either:
    <ul>
      <li>a person with a <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate and Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) check from a local provider who has closed</li>
      <li>a registered local childminder with a <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate and <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check who is approved to work on non-domestic premises</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>looking to secure full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> training for staff that includes the specific risk factors and techniques required for the care of young children including but not limited to choking, seizures, and issues related to sleeping – annex A of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> statutory framework sets out the criteria for effective <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> training</li>
</ul>

<p>After these actions have been carried out and if it is still not possible for someone with a full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate to be on site at all times children are present, providers must undertake the following actions in order to remain open:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry out a written risk assessment to consider and mitigate the likely occurrence of a serious incident</li>
  <li>ensure at least one person with a current first aid at work or emergency <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certification is on site at all times children are on premises and must accompany children on outings
    <ul>
      <li>paragraph 3.65 in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> continues to apply and outings should only be undertaken if it is safe to do so</li>
      <li>providers must take account of any government advice in relation to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The written risk assessment should take into account all relevant factors with the aim of enabling the setting to ensure they can provide the safe care needed during any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19), including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of children on the premises</li>
  <li>the staff to child ratio</li>
  <li>the types of activities undertaken with the children on the premises</li>
  <li>the likely need for first aid based on the needs of the children attending the premises</li>
  <li>first aider knowledge among staff on the premises</li>
  <li>the mitigations available to reduce the risk of such an incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers will need to ensure the written risk assessment is kept available in the setting. This does not need to be sent anywhere but must be available on request.</p>

<p>Providers could help members of staff who have a first aid at work or emergency <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> certificate to help bridge the gap between their current qualification and full <abbr title="paediatric first aid">PFA</abbr> by looking to secure online training to cover elements required for the care of young children.</p>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provides <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/geis3.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on choosing a first aid training provider</a>.</p>

<p>As set out in HSE guidance, any training in relation to paediatric CPR and choking should be in line with the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.resus.org.uk/resuscitation-guidelines/paediatric-basic-life-support">Resuscitation Council’s guidance</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/resuscitating-a-baby" class="govuk-link">NHS England guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Safeguarding and welfare</h3>

<p>All other aspects of the safeguarding and welfare section of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> framework still apply, including requirements relating to child protection arrangements. Providers will want to consider whether any refresh or review is needed of their child protection arrangements, policy and procedures, in light of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, including any period of intervention related to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Settings must continue to have a practitioner designated to take lead responsibility for safeguarding.  It is acceptable for the safeguarding lead to not be based on site if this is not practical, for example, they may be working from home, or be based at another setting, as long as they are still available to provide support, advice and guidance to staff.</p>
