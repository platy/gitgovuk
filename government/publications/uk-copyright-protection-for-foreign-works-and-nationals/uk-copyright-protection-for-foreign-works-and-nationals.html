<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This page provides general guidance on how UK law protects foreign copyright works and performances. It is not legal advice and is not intended to be comprehensive.</p>
</div>

<p>UK copyright law extends full, partial or no protection to foreign works and performances based on the country of origin of the work or performance.</p>

<p>This is generally based on principles in the copyright treaties that the UK has joined. These include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)</li>
  <li>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</li>
  <li>Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations</li>
  <li>World Intellectual Property Organization (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organization">WIPO</abbr>) Copyright Treaty (WCT)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Organization">WIPO</abbr> Performances and Phonograms Treaty (<abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These require the UK to protect copyright works (such as books, broadcasts and sound recordings) and performances from other countries that are members of these treaties.</p>

<p>The UK also has trade agreements and reciprocal arrangements with various countries under which the UK protects copyright works and performances from those countries.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Overview</h3>

<p>The protection for foreign works and performances is set out in the following legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/contents" rel="external">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988</a> (the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1219/contents" rel="external">Copyright and Performances (Application to Other Countries) Order 2016</a> (the 2016 Order) as amended by the Copyright and Performances (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/636/contents/made" rel="external">Application to other Countries</a>) (Amendment) Order 2021 (the first 2021 Order) and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1258/made" rel="external">Copyright and Performances (Application To Other Countries) (Amendment) (No.2) Order 2021</a> (the second 2021 Order).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr> is the main UK legislation on copyright. Part I of the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr> deals with copyright works. Chapter IX of Part I sets out the nationality requirements for works to qualify for protection.</p>

<p>Part II of the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr> deals with rights in performances. Chapter IV of Part II sets out the nationality requirements for performances to qualify for protection.</p>

<p>The 2016 Order simplified the way in which protection is extended to foreign works and performances. It means that most protection is automatically extended to other countries as they become members of the copyright treaties. It also restricts the protection extended to some foreign works and performances.</p>

<p>The first 2021 Order amended the 2016 Order. It updated the 2016 Order’s list of countries that are members of <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr>. This ensures that performers from those countries enjoy rights in the UK. It also extended protections to nationals of certain countries with which the UK has a trade agreement. The second 2021 Order further amended the 2016 Order. It extends copyright protection to certain works from Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to implement the UK’s trade agreement with those countries.</p>

<p>Below is a summary of the protection for foreign works and performances under the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr> and 2016 Order. However, different rules apply in some cases. For detailed information on the protection for foreign works and performances, check the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr> and the 2016 Order as amended.</p>

<h3>Literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works, films and typographical arrangements</h3>

<p>Literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works, films, and typographical arrangements of published editions are eligible for protection if any of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the author is a citizen or resident of, or a body incorporated under the law of, the UK or a country that is party to the Berne Convention or a member of the World Trade Organization (<abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the work was first published in the UK or a country that is party to the Berne Convention or a member of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the work is linked to the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an Overseas Territory as set out in Chapter IX of the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Broadcasts</h3>

<p>Broadcasts are eligible for protection if any of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the broadcaster is a citizen or resident of, or a body incorporated under the law of, the UK or a country that is party to the Rome Convention or a member of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the broadcast is first transmitted from the UK or a country that is party to the Rome Convention or a member of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the broadcast is linked to the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or an Overseas Territory as set out in Chapter IX of the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Broadcasts from countries that are party to the Rome Convention or members of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> normally only qualify for protection if they are wireless broadcasts. However, wired broadcasts from certain countries listed in the 2016 Order are also protected. Broadcasts from countries which are party to the Rome Convention normally receive greater protection than those from countries that are not party to the Rome Convention.</p>

<h3>Sound recordings</h3>

<p>Sound recordings are eligible for protection if any of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the producer is a citizen or resident of, or a body incorporated under the law of, the UK or a country that is party to the Rome Convention, <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr>, the Berne Convention or a member of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the sound recording was first published in the UK or a country that is party to the Rome Convention, <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr>, the Berne Convention or a member of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the sound recording is linked to the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an Overseas Territory as set out in Chapter IX of the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Sound recordings from countries which are party to the Rome Convention or <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr> normally receive greater protection than those from countries which are not party to these treaties. However, sound recordings from countries which are party to the <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr> but not the Rome Convention normally receive less protection than those from countries which are party to the Rome Convention.</p>

<h3>Performances</h3>

<p>Performances are eligible for protection if any of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the performance was given in, or by a citizen or resident of, the UK or a country that is party to the Rome Convention, <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr> or a member of the <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the performance is linked to the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or an Overseas Territory as set out in sections 181 and 206 of the <abbr title="Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988">CDPA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Performances from countries which are party to the Rome Convention or <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr> normally receive greater protection than those from countries which are not party to these treaties. However, performances from countries which are party to the <abbr title="WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty">WPPT</abbr> but not the Rome Convention normally receive less protection than those from countries which are party to the Rome Convention.</p>

<p>Performances in films normally qualify for protection only if they come from countries that are party to the Rome Convention. Performances in sound recordings normally only qualify for remuneration for being played in public or broadcast if they come from a country that provides equivalent protection to UK performers.</p>
