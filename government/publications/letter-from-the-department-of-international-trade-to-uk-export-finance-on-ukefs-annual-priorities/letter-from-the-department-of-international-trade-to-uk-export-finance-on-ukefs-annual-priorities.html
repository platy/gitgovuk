<p>17 March 2021</p>

<p>Dear Louis,</p>

<p>I want to thank you for your leadership of UK Export Finance (<abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>) and for the critical role it has played in response to the challenges arising from COVID-19. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> has continued to support HM Government’s goal of ensuring the success and financial health of UK businesses during this unprecedented time.</p>

<p>As Secretary of State for International Trade with responsibility for <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>, I wish to outline my priorities for <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> for the coming year. I endorse the new Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>) between <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> and the Department for International Trade (<abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>), which will encourage ever closer collaboration to support and grow UK exports, particularly through our work on the Plan for Growth. This document complements the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> and ensures <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> is delivering against the priorities of HMG. I expect you to, on a quarterly basis, keep the <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> Board updated of progress in accordance with the provisions for reporting set out in the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> and I expect the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> to facilitate the bilateral exchange of information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Meeting the priorities of Her Majesty’s Government</h2>

<p>The government has identified a number of strategic priorities, that I have set out below alongside my expectations of how <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> will work to deliver against those priorities:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Export-led recovery</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s mission is to ensure that no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance from the private sector, while operating at no net cost to the taxpayer. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> does not compete with the private sector in the support it offers to exporters. Capturing the benefits of exporting and international trade opportunities will be vital - helping to support job creation, wage growth, and levelling up the economy across the regions and nations of the UK - and I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to play a central role in supporting the government’s ambitious trade programme.</p>

<p>I therefore expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to continue working closely with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), HM Treasury (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr>) and the British Business Bank to ensure businesses can access the financial support they need during these testing times. I am particularly keen that <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> supports <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s efforts to boost exports in HMG priority sectors and our Export Campaigns including food and drink, technology and digital, and renewables and clean growth. I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to work closely with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr> in identifying and implementing potential opportunities to provide additional support and develop new policies and products where they are needed, aligned to priority sectors, including the HMG Plan for Growth and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> Export Plan.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Clean Growth</h2>

<p>At the end of 2020, the Prime Minister announced the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-outlines-his-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution-for-250000-jobs" class="govuk-link">Ten Point Plan</a> for a Green Industrial Revolution. The government is committed to turning the UK into the world’s number one centre for green technology and finance and delivering net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Prime Minister announced that the UK will no longer provide any new direct financial or promotional support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas. I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to support businesses (which are actively transitioning away from fossil fuels) delivering renewable and clean energy, helping the UK to ‘build back greener’ and create new skilled job opportunities.</p>

<p>Noting <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s achievements in this area to date, you should build on previous successes supporting clean growth exports, for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukef-supports-offshore-wind-deal-in-taiwan-and-uk-green-jobs-with-200-million">offshore wind project in Taiwan</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-solar-company-secures-funding-to-build-two-major-solar-plants-in-spain">solar projects in Spain</a>. I expect that, by the summer, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> will have worked with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr> to explore and develop new “green” products. In the run-up to COP26, hosted in the UK this autumn, I would like <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to work closely with the COP26 teams ensuring that the government’s trade finance offer is embedded in their stakeholder engagement, whether that be with exporters or non-governmental organisations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Climate-risk disclosures</h2>

<p>As the new year marks the start of a new chapter for UK financial services, I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to lead by example. Last year the Chancellor announced that the UK was to become the first country in the world to make Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (<abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>) recommendations fully mandatory across the economy by 2025. By this summer, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> will make its first climate-related financial disclosures in its 2020-21 annual report in line with the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations, as committed in the 2019 Green Finance Strategy. This will demonstrate <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s role supporting the government’s greening of the UK economy.</p>

<p>In the March 2020 Budget, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> allocated £2 billion to its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/direct-lending-additional-features" class="govuk-link">Clean Growth Direct Lending Facility</a>, designed to support projects that meet the criteria of the Green Bond Principles. There has been significant take-up already which will be reported after the close of the financial year in <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s Annual Report and Accounts, once the audit has been completed. This year, I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to continue to promote and market this facility to UK exporters that seek to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>The Union and Levelling up</h2>

<p>The full range of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s products and services is available to support exporters across the whole of the UK and I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to continue to promote and target its services to the UK’s SMEs and larger exporters across the length and breadth of the country. This year, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> will enhance its network of domestic <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-an-export-finance-manager">Export Finance Managers</a>, particularly outside London. I would like to see <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s Export Finance Managers working hand- in- hand with Trade Advisers in <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s new Trade and Investment Hubs due to open in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Northern Economic Hub.</p>

<p>Supporting SMEs is a particular priority of mine. At the beginning of this year, the Federation of Small Businesses found that more than 250,000 of the UK’s 5.9 million small businesses could be lost as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting our SMEs through the recovery from the pandemic is of paramount importance. In December 2020, <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> launched its SME-focused <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/general-export-facility" class="govuk-link">General Export Facility</a> (<abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr>) through its five delegated banks and is now engaging other partner banks and financial institutions to roll out the scheme through them. <abbr title="General Export Facility">GEF</abbr> will also be promoted through <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s marketing campaign, which has an increased budget for the 2021-22 financial year following the Spending Review. I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to support a wide range of SMEs through this new product and I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to continue to work closely with the British Business Bank to improve consistency and coherence in HMG support for access to finance to SMEs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Global Britain</h2>

<p>Our new FTAs will encourage greater exporting to new markets and will create a growing need for finance and support from <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>. I expect <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to work with UK exporters who will want to capitalise on the opportunities these new markets will bring. This year <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> will increase its international network and recruit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-an-international-export-finance-executive" class="govuk-link">International Export Finance Executives</a> (<abbr title="International Export Finance Executives">IEFEs</abbr>) into Malaysia, the Philippines, Qatar, Egypt, Morocco, and the US.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s <abbr title="International Export Finance Executives">IEFEs</abbr> should collaborate with HM Trade Commissioners and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s new at-Post Campaign Directors (for example, in Mexico and India) so that <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> can work closely together overseas to identify opportunities for UK exporters. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s international network will be instrumental in helping government focus on business opportunities within the Indo-Pacific as we look to secure new markets within the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Accountability</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s governance framework includes the mechanisms between <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> including the Concordat and the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr>, as well as the powers set out in the Export and Investment Guarantees Act (1991), the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr> Consent and Financial Framework Document. It also adheres to relevant international agreements such as the <abbr title="Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development">OECD</abbr> Arrangement and <abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr> Agreements on Subsidies. 2021 marks the beginning of an exciting new phase for the UK. For the first time in 40 years, we will make our own trading arrangements with countries around the world, free from the constraints of the EU. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> must play a central role in helping UK businesses realise their full potential in this new world.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you on your progress delivering against my priorities and am excited as your Secretary of State to embark on another challenging but successful year.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>THE RT HON ELIZABETH TRUSS MP</p>

<p>Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade</p>
