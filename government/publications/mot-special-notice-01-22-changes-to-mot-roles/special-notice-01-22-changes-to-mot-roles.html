<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> MOT testing guide and MOT inspection manuals</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mot-testing-guide">MOT testing guide</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/mot/manuals">MOT inspection manuals (all classes)</a> will be updated on 2 March 2022.</p>

<h3>What’s changing</h3>

<p>We will cover some of the changes to the MOT testing guide in this special notice, to read the full list of changes click ‘see all updates’ at the top of the MOT testing guide on 2 March 2022.</p>

<p>To view the changes to the MOT inspection manual, including updated retest guidance, click ‘see all updates’ at the top of each manual on 2 March 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Authorised Examiner Designated Manager (AEDM)</h2>

<p>This role has responsibility for all MOT testing operations and is currently held by an AE principal - a sole trader, a partner or for a limited company a director or officer of the company. For large organisations with multiple sites the AE may nominate a senior manager to perform this role.</p>

<p>Following a consultation with the trade, we are making changes to this role.</p>

<h3>What’s changing</h3>

<p>From 2 March 2022, the Driver and Vehicle and Standards Agency (DVSA) are making a change to who can hold the Authorised Examiner Designated Manager (AEDM) role.</p>

<p>The responses from a recent consultation state that the AEDM should normally be a business principal, but that all AEs should be able to nominate a senior manager where this would result in more effective fulfilment of the role.</p>

<p>Therefore this dispensation will no longer be restricted to large organisations.</p>

<p>An AEDM must be a person who has an overall view of the entire MOT business. It must be a person who can authorise and effect change, rather than just report what is needed to those with the power to effect the change.</p>

<h3>Clarification of the tasks of the AEDM role</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mot-testing-guide/m-system-rules-and-user-roles">MOT testing guide - section M</a> will be updated to explain more fully the tasks and responsibilities of an AEDM.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>The reason for bringing in these changes is to improve the understanding of the duties and responsibilities required of an AEDM and to enable the right person to carry out the role on behalf of the AE.</p>

<p>The benefits of this change include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clarity over who is suitable and would be accepted as an AEDM</li>
  <li>the content and expectations of the role are clear, enabling the AE to nominate a suitable person to hold the role</li>
  <li>the effectiveness of the role is improved - it is expected the AEDM would work closely with the site managers to ensure high quality and consistency</li>
  <li>the right person in the role is more likely to be actively engaged in delivering the requirements of the AEDM - this is a benefit to both the business and DVSA but most importantly the public</li>
  <li>the impact and importance of the AEDM role in the delivery of MOT compliance and high quality operations is recognised</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The Authorised Examiner is ultimately responsible for the correct operation of all their VTSs and test standards for every test conducted under their approval. The assignment of an AEDM does not change or devolve that responsibility.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> AE Training</h2>

<p>An Authorised Examiner Designated Manager (AEDM) is required to successfully attend a level 3 course in MOT Test Centre Management.</p>

<p>Following the change to the eligibility of the AEDM, if an Authorised Examiner (AE) opts to nominate a senior manager to take the role of AEDM, who is not an Authorised Examiner Principal (AEP), an AEP will still need to attend the course.</p>

<p>This is to ensure an AE is fully conversant with the legal and regulatory responsibilities and what is involved in operating a compliant MOT garage. The course should also make the AE aware of what they should expect from their AEDM.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Authorised Examiner Principal (AEP)</h2>

<p>Authorised Examiner Principals (AEPs) are the people who make up the business - the sole trader, partners in a partnership, directors in a company. They are legally responsible for the entity.</p>

<p>Currently they do not have direct access to the MOT testing service.</p>

<h3>What’s changing</h3>

<p>From 2 March 2022, all new applicants or current AEs that wish to make a change to their approval will be assigned an AEP role that allows them to use the MOT testing service.</p>

<p>This will give access to information about their authorised examiner (AE), vehicle testing stations (VTSs), MOT staff and tests carried out under their approval.</p>

<p>In line with the Data Protection Act, you will only be able to see information about your own authorisation.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>This will allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>view and monitor the work taking place under your authorisation</li>
  <li>view your approval details to ensure they are kept up to date</li>
</ul>

<h3>What do I need to do</h3>

<p>If your AE details are up to date and correct you do not need to do anything.</p>

<p>If you need to make a change to your approval such as add or remove a director or change an AEDM, you will need to:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Complete a VT01 and send it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:motadministration@dvsa.gov.uk">motadministration@dvsa.gov.uk</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check all conditions are met for the type of change requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each AEP will need to create an account on MTS. This must be done by the individual themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you already have an account, you do not need to create another one. The role will be added to your original account.</p>
