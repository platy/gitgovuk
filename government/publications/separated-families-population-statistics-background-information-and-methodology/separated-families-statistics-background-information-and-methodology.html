<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This note accompanies the main Separated Families Statistics report.</p>

<p>The purpose of this note is to provide further contextual information to aid understanding of the statistics presented in the main report and detailed tables. It outlines terminology in the statistics, describes source data as well as limitations of the information presented and changes to the survey this year compared to last year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Context of the statistics</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This release contains annual data to March 2021 from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data. It therefore includes the first 12 months of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In summary, several factors affected FRS data collection, response rates and the distribution of characteristics among FRS survey respondents including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change in the mode of interviewing</li>
  <li>changes in the methods used to contact survey participants</li>
  <li>changes in peopleâs behaviours and circumstances during the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>More details on the effects of COVID-19 on the FRS as a whole are included in this document and the FRS background information and methodology note. The effects of COVID-19 on HBAI data and statistics are available in the HBAI technical report.</p>
</div>

<p>These statistics provide estimates of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of separated families in Great Britain and the number of children in those families</li>
  <li>the proportion of separated families with a child maintenance arrangement  and whether this arrangement is statutory or non-statutory</li>
  <li>the total amount of child maintenance received by Parents With Care, by arrangement type</li>
  <li>the net impact of child maintenance payments on the number of children in low income households</li>
  <li>characteristics of separated parents and the impacts of child maintenance payments on where their households are represented in the income distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>This release includes the following changes:â¯</p>

<ul>
  <li>methodology improvements to simplify how we address the misreporting of child maintenance arrangements. These include using new survey questions from the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> and changing an aggregate level adjustment for misreporting to individual level adjustments. These affect:
    <ol>
      <li>the proportion of separated families with a child maintenance arrangement</li>
      <li>the estimated number of separated families</li>
      <li>the total amount of maintenance received by Parents with Care</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>a change in approach to the tables showing the position of parents in separated families in the income distribution, so that they now show the income distribution of all individuals in Parent with Care and Non-Resident Parent households.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details on these changes can be found in section 7 of this report.</p>

<h3>How separated families might select a child maintenance arrangement</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/117398/1-flow-chart.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>It should be noted that there is no requirement for all separated families to have an arrangement and some families may not want an arrangement. If parents do want an arrangement they may be able to agree this themselves without the involvement of the Child Maintenance Service (<abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>). Arrangements made in this way are called non-statutory arrangements or âfamily based arrangementsâ and can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>voluntary financial arrangements which involve direct monetary payments between parents where the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> has not been involved</li>
  <li>voluntary non-financial arrangements which involve payments in kind</li>
  <li>other types of arrangements including shared care arrangements</li>
  <li>court orders requiring parents to make financial payments</li>
</ul>

<p>Where parents want an arrangement but need help with this, they can use online support via Get Help Arranging Child Maintenance. This is a new digital service for child maintenance applications and information about the choices available to parents to either make their own arrangement or use the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>. From 1 April 2022 it replaces the previous Child Maintenance Options service which provided support via telephone or in writing.</p>

<p>If further support is required, parents can ask the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> to calculate the amount of maintenance to be paid and/or to manage and collect payments. Arrangements made in this way are called statutory arrangements and the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> can take enforcement action to ensure payments are made.</p>

<p>During the period covered by these statistics, financial years ending 2015 to 2021, statutory child maintenance moved from the Child Support Agency (<abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>) to the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>. <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases began closing in June 2014 and under the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> more freedom and support was provided to enable parents to choose the arrangement that works best for them. This could be a statutory arrangement or a non-statutory arrangement, and there was no requirement for parents to have an arrangement. Not all <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases were expected to transfer to the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases were closed in groups and those closed first were the simpler cases, such as those with no liability in place. The last cases to close were more complex, such as those where enforcement action was on-going. By December 2018, all the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases with on-going liabilities were closed. Parents who still wanted an arrangement could use on-line support or contact Child Maintenance Options for further information on how to set up a non-statutory, family-based arrangement or a statutory arrangement with the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of the statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics are used by various stakeholders within the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) to measure progress against policy intent. They may also be used to answer Parliamentary Questions and requests under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>The statistics included in this publication are also intended for use by other interested parties in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and by interested members of the public.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Definitions and terminology within the statistics</h2>

<p>The key definitions and terminology used within these statistics are explained here.</p>

<h3>Separated family</h3>

<p>A separated family is defined as one Parent With Care, one Non-Resident Parent and any biological or adopted children they have between them who are either under 16 or under 20 and in full-time non-tertiary education.</p>

<h3>Parent With Care</h3>

<p>A Parent With Care is the parent who has sole or main day-to-day care of any relevant children and who may potentially be eligible to receive child maintenance.</p>

<h3>Non-Resident Parent</h3>

<p>A Non-Resident Parent is the parent who does not have sole or main day-to-day care of any relevant children and who may be required to pay child maintenance.</p>

<h3>Child maintenance arrangement</h3>

<p>There are 2 main types of child maintenance arrangement</p>

<ul>
  <li>statutory arrangements</li>
  <li>non-statutory arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>Separated families may have more than one type of arrangement.</p>

<h3>Statutory arrangement</h3>

<p>Statutory child maintenance arrangements are those which have been arranged with the help of the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> or its predecessor, the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Non-statutory arrangement</h3>

<p>Non-statutory arrangements do not involve the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> or <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>voluntary financial arrangements involving direct monetary payments between parents where the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> or <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> have not been involved</li>
  <li>voluntary non-financial arrangements involving payments in kind</li>
  <li>other types of arrangement including shared care arrangements</li>
  <li>court orders requiring parents to make financial payments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collect and Pay arrangement</h3>

<p>An arrangement where the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> collects and manages maintenance payments from the Non-Resident Parent (or âPaying Parentâ) to the Parent With Care (or âReceiving Parentâ). If required, the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> will take enforcement action.</p>

<h3>Direct Pay arrangement</h3>

<p>An arrangement where the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> calculates the amount of maintenance to be paid, and parents arrange the payments between themselves.</p>

<h3>Child Maintenance Options</h3>

<p>Child Maintenance Options is a free service providing impartial information and support to help separated parents make decisions about their child maintenance arrangements. From 1 April 2022, Get Help Arranging Child Maintenance will replace the Child Maintenance Option Service.</p>

<h3>Get Help Arranging Child Maintenance</h3>

<p>Get Help Arranging Child Maintenance is a new digital service for child maintenance applications and information about the choices available to parents to either make their own (non-statutory) arrangement or use the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Child Maintenance Service (<abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> was introduced in December 2012. It replaced the <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> and is for separated parents who canât arrange child maintenance between themselves. Parents can ask the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> to calculate the amount of maintenance to be paid and, if necessary, to help manage and collect payments. Since the end of 2018, all <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases with on-going liabilities closed. Parents now have the option of setting up a statutory arrangement with the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr>, a non-statutory, family-based arrangement, or choosing not to have an arrangement at all.</p>

<h3>Equivalised household income</h3>

<p>If a householdâs income is equivalised it means that it has been adjusted for household size and composition to make it comparable with other householdsâ incomes</p>

<h3>Low income</h3>

<p>A household is said to be in relative low income if their equivalised income is below 60% of median household income, while they are said to be in absolute low income if their equivalised income is below 60% of the median household income adjusted for inflation for the financial year ending 2011. For comparative purposes, both relative and absolute low income are estimated before and after taking housing costs into account.</p>

<h3>Deciles and Quintiles</h3>

<p>Deciles divide the population, when ranked by equivalised household income, into 10 equal sized groups, and are indicated by 1 to 10, while quintiles divide the population into 5 groups.</p>

<h3>Income Distribution</h3>

<p>This shows how equivalised household income is shared through a population. Comparisons to the equivalised household income percentiles of a reference population allow the income distributions of different groups to be compared. In this publication we show the distribution of equivalised household incomes of individuals in Parent with Care and Non-Resident Parent households relative to the equivalised household income deciles of all individuals in Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Financial years</h3>

<p>The financial year begins on 1 April and ends on 31 March.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Source of the statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics are estimates derived from survey data and combined with administrative data where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Estimates are based primarily on data from the Family Resources Survey</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The FRS is a continuous survey based on a representative sample usually comprising around 19,000 private households in the United Kingdom. The sample for the financial year ending 2021 is significantly smaller at around 10,000 private households due to impacts of COVID-19. Sample sizes were reduced, particularly in the earlier part of the year, and the mode of the survey questionnaire was changed from face to face to telephone, affecting the response rates of different groups. In addition, the composition of the FRS achieved sample changed significantly between the financial years ending 2020 and 2021. The grossing regime was adjusted to improve the representativeness of the sample but some unknown biases remain. COVID-19 and the government response to its impact have also had a significant effect on the UK labour market, which will have affected separated families and their incomes. More information can be found in the FRS background information and methodology note.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> collects information on the income, characteristics and circumstances of respondents, including the relationships within their households and any child maintenance arrangements they may have.</p>

<p><abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> respondents are assumed to be Parents With Care in a separated family if their responses indicate that they are the biological or adoptive parent of a child who lives in their household and that child has no other biological or adoptive parents in the household. Parents who are widowed or part of an intact couple where the partner lives away, for example due to work, are excluded.</p>

<p>The appropriate survey weights are applied to the survey responses to obtain population-level estimates of the number of Parents With Care and children in separated families.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> responses regarding child maintenance arrangements are checked for accuracy against <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> administrative databases, in line with <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> linking protocols</h3>

<p>If a Parent With Care respondent indicates that they have no statutory arrangement but this is contradicted by the administrative data, then it is assumed that they have a statutory arrangement and their <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> response is adjusted accordingly. This helps to correct for the under-reporting of statutory arrangements. Non-statutory arrangements are also under-reported, but a new question added to the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> in the financial year ending 2020 is used to help address this under-reporting. More information on the change to the methodology can be found in section 7.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> estimates relating to Parents With Care are converted into estimates relating to the number of separated families</h3>

<p>This is done based on estimates of the average number of child maintenance arrangements per Parent With Care obtained from <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> administrative data.</p>

<h3>Estimates of the total amount of child maintenance payments received by Parents With Care are based on a combination of administrative data and adjusted <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data.</h3>

<p>Estimates of the total amount of maintenance received by Parents With Care with a statutory arrangement are obtained via Collect and Pay and Direct Pay arrangement information from <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> administrative data. For all statutory arrangements partial compliance is assumed. From this publication, estimates of the total amount of maintenance received by Parents With Care with a non-statutory arrangement are obtained from adjusted <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data. For example, where an arrangement is reported as a statutory arrangement in the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> and they are not found on <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> administrative data, it is assumed that they have a non-statutory arrangement. More information on this change can be found in section 7.</p>

<h3>Parents With Care and Non-Resident Parent age and gender breakdown estimates.</h3>

<p>These estimates of age and gender proportions are produced using <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data that has been adjusted for misreporting of arrangements.</p>

<h3>Estimates of the impact of child maintenance payments on household income.</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2020"><abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> data and methodology</a> are used to derive estimates of <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> respondentsâ equivalised household income which takes into account household size and composition to make these income estimates comparable. This means it is possible to estimate whether or not the respondents and their children live in a low income household. <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data is used to work out income before child maintenance payments. It is then possible to observe the impact that such payments have on the number of children moving in and out of low income, and the movement of separated parent households in the income distribution. The impacts on both Parent With Care and Non-Resident Parent households are accounted for. COVID-19 has also affected <abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> data as it is derived from the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>. More information can be found in the <abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> technical report.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Limitations of the statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics are estimates and are subject to limitations. The main issues are described here.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> is subject to sampling error</h3>

<p>All survey estimates have a sampling error associated with them, calculated from the variability of the observations in the survey sample. In general terms, the smaller the sample size, the greater the uncertainty of the estimates. Results in this report are subject to a margin of error which can affect how changes should be interpreted, especially between groups and in the short term. The sample in Great Britain for the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> is selected using a stratified multi-stage design, based on addresses clustered within postcode sectors. As a result, <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> sampling error is not just dependent on the variability among units in the sample (whether households or individuals), but is also a function of variability within and between postcode sectors. Therefore, the complex (actual) sampling error is normally greater than the standard error calculated under the assumption of simple random sampling.</p>

<p>A margin of error (confidence interval) is usually calculated to determine whether the changes observed in survey estimates are statistically significant and are unlikely to result from measurement error. This is currently not done for the Separated Families Statistics but is being explored for future publications.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This publication includes a three-year average for some statistics to minimise the sample error and control for volatility in the sample from one period to the next. Due to the sample size being around half its usual size in the financial year ending 2021, following the impacts of COVID-19, estimates are expected to be substantially more uncertain than usual. Users should interpret results with care, particularly across years.</p>
</div>

<h3>There are some limitations regarding the way <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> questions are asked</h3>

<p>In the year 2016 to 2017 changes were made to the routing and wording of the questions relating to child maintenance. Prior to this year there was no routing between the detailed relationship questions and the reporting of children for child maintenance purposes. This meant that some respondents who were potentially eligible for a child maintenance arrangement were subsequently recorded as having no eligible child rather than no arrangement and not routed to the more detailed questions. This may have introduced some inaccuracy in our reporting of the number and types of arrangements prior to the financial year ending 2017.</p>

<h3>There are some issues regarding <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> response accuracy</h3>

<p>The general approach taken is to assume that survey responses relating to family circumstances and child maintenance arrangements are accurate, unless they are contradicted by the existence of a relevant statutory arrangement in the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> administrative databases.</p>

<h3>Linking relevant <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> administrative records to <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> respondents</h3>

<p>In the published years before the financial year ending 2019, not all respondents consented to linking and it was not possible to link all responses of those who did consent. However, due to changes in the legal basis for linking since 2018, as well as improvements in linking methodology it is now possible to link a large majority of relevant <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> cases to <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> administrative data.</p>

<h3>Parents With Care can be associated with more than one separated family. However, there is limited data on the number of separated families associated with the Parents With Care identified</h3>

<p>To convert estimates relating to Parents With Care into estimates relating to separated families, a scaling factor is applied. This scaling factor is informed by the average number of live statutory arrangements associated with all of the Parents With Care in the <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> administrative databases who had a statutory arrangement. Due to a lack of data on non-statutory arrangements, the scaling factor is only based on statutory cases.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the scaling factor can be applied to all of the Parents With Care identified using the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data, regardless of the type(s) of child maintenance arrangement(s) they have (if any).</p>

<p>It is also assumed that all separated families associated with a given Parent With Care are covered by the same type(s) of child maintenance arrangement(s).</p>

<h3>There is limited information regarding the amount of child maintenance payments received via <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> Direct Pay arrangements</h3>

<p>Estimates of the total amount of maintenance received by Parents With Care with a Direct Pay arrangement are derived from <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> administrative data. However, these published data only show the total amount of maintenance that has been arranged via Direct Pay and not the total amount that has been paid. An assumption is therefore made regarding the proportion of arranged Direct Pay payments that are actually received <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/child-maintenance-arrangements-made-after-speaking-to-cm-options-feb-2020">based on surveys</a> of Child Maintenance Options customers that were conducted in 2018.</p>

<h3>Estimates of the impact of child maintenance payments on the number of children in low income households do not take any potential behavioural impacts into account</h3>

<p>The estimates are based on a basic analysis of the impact of reported maintenance payments on household incomes, all other things being equal.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> methodology has been improved to take into account the impact of all child maintenance payments on the number of children in low income households</h3>

<p>This small enhancement means in the Separated Families publication all estimates from the financial year ending in 2019 will represent all components of child maintenance income reported to the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Non-Resident Parent Under representation</h3>

<p>The number of Non-Resident Parents that we find on the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> is lower than expected when comparing to the number of Parents With Care. Potential biases in the Non-Resident Parent characteristics and income distribution reported in the statistics depend on the differences between the Non-Resident Parents who do not identify themselves and those that do.</p>

<p>Future work is planned to try and identify further Non-Resident Parents in the sample.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Comparisons between the statistics</h2>

<p>The contents of this publication are not comparable with any estimates in the previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/estimates-of-the-separated-family-population-to-december-2014">estimates of the separated family population to December 2014 publication</a> which was withdrawn in December 2018. The withdrawal of this publication was explained in a separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/estimates-of-the-separated-family-population-statistics-statistical-notice/estimates-of-the-separated-family-population-experimental-statistics-statistical-notice?">statistical notice</a>.</p>

<p>Estimates of the number of separated families with a statutory child maintenance arrangement derived from these statistics should not be compared against caseload estimates in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-on-the-2012-statutory-child-maintenance-scheme">Child Maintenance Service statistics</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/child-support-agency-quarterly-summary-statistics--2#latest-quarterly-summary-statistics">Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary Statistics publications</a>.</p>

<p>The estimates in those publications are based on administrative data, whilst these statistics are estimates based on survey data which excludes some household types and is subject to sampling error (see above). Also the publications mentioned above provide quarterly caseload figures, whilst these estimates are based on survey responses at a point in time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Revisions to the statistics</h3>

<p>These statistics are estimates derived using a methodology which will continue to be reviewed and, where feasible, improved. While estimates up to and including the publication with the financial year ending 2018 will not be revised, future publications may include revisions from the publication with the financial year ending in 2019.  Any future revisions will be clearly indicated and explained in the relevant publication.</p>

<p>Estimates are based primarily on data from the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>, which is not routinely revised. Where feasible and appropriate, the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data has been checked for accuracy against administrative data and adjusted accordingly. The <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> caseload databases used are not routinely revised.</p>

<h3>The closure of <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr>.</h3>

<p>Estimates from and following the financial year ending 2019 should not be compared with earlier estimates. All live <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases were closed by the end of December 2018 and no <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> cases have been linked to <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data from the financial year ending 2019. Data from the financial year ending 2019 onwards is only linked to <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> data, a more robust administrative data source. Due to improvements in the quality of administrative data used, more robust assumptions became possible after linking to survey data allowing for greater accuracy. This change creates a break in the time series on the number of separated families, the numbers of children in those families and the proportions of separated families with child maintenance arrangements before the financial year ending 2019</p>

<h3>Revisions to the methodology for the March 2022 publication</h3>

<p>Three methodological changes have been made for the latest publication. These are discussed below.</p>

<h3>Proportion of separated families with a non-statutory child maintenance arrangement and number of separated families</h3>

<p>There has been a change to how we calculate the proportion of separated families that have a non-statutory child maintenance arrangement, which in turn affects the overall proportion of separated families with a child maintenance arrangement. The change uses a new question that was added to the Family Resources Survey in the financial year ending 2020, which allows the identification of further family-based arrangements. This simplifies the methodology for capturing under-reported family-based arrangements, which previously used assumptions drawn from under-reported compliant statutory arrangements.</p>

<p>Improvements to data linking between the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> and administrative data allow us to simultaneously simplify our adjustment for under-reporting of statutory arrangements in the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> from an aggregate level adjustment to individual case level adjustments.</p>

<p>Together, the changes to under-reporting of child maintenance arrangements lead to the following revisions for the financial year ending 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an increase in the overall proportion of separated families with a child maintenance arrangement from 56% to 59%</li>
  <li>an increase in the proportion of separated families with a non-statutory arrangement by 4 percentage points from 38% to 42%</li>
  <li>a one percentage point reduction in the proportion of separated families with statutory arrangements alone from 15% to 14%</li>
  <li>a decrease in the rounded number of separated families identified from 2.4m to 2.3m</li>
</ul>

<p>The new methodology will also be applied to the data for the financial year ending 2021. The proportion of separated families with a child maintenance arrangement and the number of separated families from and following the financial year ending 2020 should not be compared with the earlier estimates. These changes create a second break in the time series on proportions of separated families with child maintenance arrangements and numbers of separated families before the financial year ending 2020. However, these changes lead to improvements in accuracy and facilitate further developments to the statistics now and in future.</p>

<h3>The total amount of maintenance received by Parents With Care</h3>

<p>The adjustment for under-reporting of statutory arrangements in the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> has changed from an aggregate level adjustment to adjustments on individual cases. This is described above. It allows an improvement to the estimate of the total amount of maintenance received. Parents With Care who report a statutory arrangement in the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> and that they are receiving payment, but who are not found on administrative data, are now categorised as having a non-statutory arrangement. The amount they reported receiving can be attributed to that arrangement category.  Previously we only counted money received through non-statutory arrangements that were reported as such on the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>, while statutory amounts of money received were and continue to be taken from administrative data.</p>

<h3>Position of separated parent household members in the income distribution</h3>

<p>In the tables that previously showed the position of Parents With Care and Non-Resident Parents in the income distribution before and after child maintenance, there is a change that now also includes the children in the same household as each parent. It is now an income distribution of all the individuals in Parent With Care and Non-Resident Parent households rather than just the parents themselves. This has been done by using a dataset of all individuals in separated families, instead of a dataset of adults only, and incorporating an individual grossing factor. This allows for a better understanding about the impact child maintenance has on whole households, rather than just the parents. This has caused minor changes to the statistic, with a slightly lower representation of individuals in Non-Resident Parent households in the first decile, compared to how the previous statistic was calculated. These income distributions are not produced as part of a time series and revised figures are not being published for earlier years. Thus, the income distributions averaged over the financial years ending 2019 to 2021 and future years will not be directly comparable to previously published income distributions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Data confidentiality and rounding</h3>

<p>There is no risk of inferring a personâs identity from these statistics. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100,000, except those relating to the impact of child maintenance payments on the number of children in low income households which are rounded to the nearest 20,000. Monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest hundred million pounds. Percentages are calculated using figures prior to rounding and are rounded to the nearest integer. Totals may not sum due to rounding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Status of the statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics have been developed using guidelines set out by the UK Statistics Authority and are official statistics undergoing development. They have therefore been designated as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">experimental statistics</a>. We publish these statistics on an annual basis and will continue to explore expanding their scope to help to meet user needs where reliable estimates can be obtained. Users are invited to comment on the development and relevance of these statistics at this stage and can send feedback to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cm.analysis.research@dwp.gov.uk">cm.analysis.research@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Quality statement</h2>

<p>These statistics are estimates based on an experimental methodology. The methodology and its limitations have been explained above. While developing the methodology, findings were compared against other data sources including the Understanding Society survey and <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> administrative databases to confirm their credibility.</p>

<p>The estimates are based primarily on data from the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>. Information about the reliability of the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> is provided in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020"><abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> background information and methodology note</a>. <abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> data is also used to create income-related estimates. Information about the reliability of the <abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> is provided in the <abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> quality and methodology report.</p>

<p>As discussed above, the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> and <abbr title="Household Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> data for the financial year ending 2021 was affected by data collection challenges due to COVID-19. This has led to greater uncertainty in estimates and possible biases, which could not be fully addressed through changes to sample weighting. The reasons for our decision to continue to publish the experimental Separated Families Statistics are as follows:</p>

<p>1.	Our statistics are aggregate, annual figures and do not include regional or within-year breakdowns.</p>

<p>2.	We use 3-year averages, which will help reduce uncertainty and potential unaddressed biases, for many tables including characteristic breakdowns, maintenance received, income distributions and poverty impacts.</p>

<p>3.	Comparisons to previous years do not look unreasonable or are explainable in terms of specific circumstances in the financial year ending 2021.</p>

<p>4.	Considering the use of our statistics, we do not believe that this yearâs figures risk misdirecting decisions on child maintenance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we advise users to bear the potential impacts of COVID-19 in mind when interpreting and using the data, particularly when comparing data across years.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data has been checked for accuracy against the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> and <abbr title="Child Support Agency">CSA</abbr> administrative databases and adjusted accordingly. Information about the reliability of <abbr title="Child Maintenance Service">CMS</abbr> administrative data is provided in the Child Maintenance Service statistics <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-maintenance-service-2012-scheme-experimental-statistics-background-information-and-methodology">background information and methodology note</a>.
