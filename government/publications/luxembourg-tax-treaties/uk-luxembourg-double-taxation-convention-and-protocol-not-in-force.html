  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of this Article and Article 22, the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.</p>

<p>and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.<br><br>
2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits.

    <p>All other elements of capital of a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State.</p>

<h2>Article 22: Elimination of double taxation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom or, as the case may be, regarding the exemption from United Kingdom tax of a dividend arising in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):</li>
</ol>

<p>a) Luxembourg tax payable under the laws of Luxembourg and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Luxembourg (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Luxembourg tax is computed;</p>

<p>b) a dividend which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;</p>

<p>c) the profits of a permanent establishment in Luxembourg of a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;</p>

<p>d) in the case of a dividend not exempted from tax under sub-paragraph b) above which is paid by a company which is a resident of Luxembourg to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above shall take into account the Luxembourg tax payable by the company in respect of the profits in respect of which such dividend is paid.<br><br>
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply where the Luxembourg tax payable is in accordance with the provisions of this Convention solely because the income, profits or chargeable gains referred to in that paragraph is also income derived by a resident of Luxembourg.<br><br>
3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of the United Kingdom which may be taxed in Luxembourg in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Luxembourg.<br><br>
4. Subject to the provisions of the law of Luxembourg regarding the elimination of double taxation which shall not affect the general principle hereof, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows:</p>

<p>a) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall, subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs b) and c), exempt such income or capital from tax, but may, in order to calculate the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of the resident, apply the same rates of tax as if the income or capital had not been exempted.</p>

<p>b) Where a resident of Luxembourg derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 13, paragraph 3 of Article 14, Article 16 or Article 20, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg shall allow as a deduction from the income tax on individuals or from the corporation tax of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in the United Kingdom. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>c) The provisions of sub-paragraph a) shall not apply to income derived or capital owned by a resident of Luxembourg where the United Kingdom applies the provisions of this Convention to exempt such income or capital from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10 to such income.</p>

<h2>Article 23: Non-discrimination</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except where the provisions of paragraph&nbsp;1 of Article&nbsp;9, paragraph 4 of Article&nbsp;11, paragraph&nbsp;4 of Article&nbsp;12, or paragraph&nbsp;4 of Article&nbsp;20 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident or to its nationals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Article shall apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Convention.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 24: Mutual agreement procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of either Contracting State. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where,</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and</p>

<p>b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the date when all the information required by the competent authorities in order to address the case has been provided to both competent authorities,</p>

<p>any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.</p>

<h2>Article 25: Exchange of information</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a)  to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>

<p>b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>

<p>c)  to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).<br><br>
4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.<br><br>
5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.</p>

<h2>Article 26: Assistance in the collection of taxes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Article 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes covered by the Convention together with interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or</p>

<p>b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection</p>

<p>the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.<br><br>
8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:</p>

<p>a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>

<p>b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy;</p>

<p>c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;</p>

<p>d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State;</p>

<p>e) to provide assistance if that State considers that the taxes with respect to which assistance is requested are imposed contrary to generally accepted taxation principles.</p>

<h2>Article 27: Members of diplomatic missions and consular posts</h2>

<p>Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic or permanent missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.</p>

<h2>Article 28: Entitlement to benefits</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a benefit under this Convention is denied to a person under paragraph 1, the competent authority of the Contracting State that would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or capital, or a capital gain, if such competent authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or arrangement referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authority of the Contracting State to which the request has been made will consult with the competent authority of the other State before rejecting a request made under this paragraph by a resident of that other State.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 29: Entry into force</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The Contracting States shall notify each other in writing, through diplomatic channels, that the procedures required by its law for the entry into force of this Convention have been satisfied. This Convention shall enter into force on the date of receipt of the later notification and shall thereupon have effect:</li>
</ol>

<p>(ii) in respect of other taxes on income, and taxes on capital, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January of the calendar year next following the year in which the Convention enters into force.<br><br>
2. The Convention between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed at London on 24 May 1967 as amended by the first Protocol signed at London on 18 July 1978, the second Protocol signed at London on 28 January 1983, and the third Protocol and accompanying exchange of letters signed at London on 2 July 2009 (the “prior Convention”) shall cease to have effect in respect of any tax with effect from the date upon which this Convention has effect in respect of that tax in accordance with the provisions of paragraph&nbsp;1.<br><br>
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, the provisions of Article 24 (Mutual agreement procedure) and Article 25 (Exchange of information) shall have effect from the date of entry into force of this Convention without regard to the taxable period to which the matter relates, subject, in the case of Article 25, to the condition that the information could have been supplied under the provisions of the prior Convention.<br><br>
4. In respect of the development land tax and the petroleum revenue tax to which the prior Convention applies, the prior Convention shall cease to be effective from the date upon which this Convention enters into force.<br><br>
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 and the provisions of Article 17 and paragraph 2 of Article 18, where, immediately before the entry into force of this Convention, an individual was in receipt of payments falling within paragraph 1 of Article XVIII or a pension falling within Article XIX of the prior Convention or a pension falling within Article XXII of the prior Convention and, but for the provisions of this paragraph, those payments or pensions would fall within Articles 17 or 18 of this Convention, that individual may make an irrevocable election within a period of three years from the date of entry into force of this Convention that the above-mentioned provisions of the prior Convention shall continue to apply to those payments.<br><br>
6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, an individual who is entitled to the benefits of Article XX of the prior Convention at the time of the entry into force of this Convention shall continue to be entitled to such benefits as if the prior Convention had remained in force.<br><br>
7. The prior Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with this Article.</p>

<h2>Article 30: Termination</h2>

<p>This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by one of the Contracting States. Either Contracting State may terminate this Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force of this Convention. In such event, this Convention shall cease to have effect:</p>

<p>In witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention.</p>

<p>Done in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>

<p>At the moment of signing the Convention for the Elimination of Double Taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital and the Prevention of Tax Avoidance and Evasion, this day concluded between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Convention.</p>

<ol>
  <li>With reference to sub-paragraph l) of paragraph 1 of Article 3 (General definitions) and sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Dividends):</li>
</ol>

<p>It is understood that the term “recognised pension fund” includes:</p>

<p>a) in the case of Luxembourg:</p>

<p>(i) Pension-savings companies with variable capital (sociétés d’épargne-pension à capital variable: SEPCAV);</p>

<p>(ii) Pension-savings associations (associations d’épargne-pension: ASSEP);</p>

<p>(iii) Pension funds subject to supervision and regulation by the Insurance Commissioner (Commissariat aux assurances); and</p>

<p>(iv) the Social Security Compensation Fund (Fonds de Compensation de la Sécurité Sociale) SICAV-FIS;</p>

<p>b) in the case of the United Kingdom, pension schemes (other than a social security scheme) registered under Part 4 of the Finance Act 2004, including pension funds or pension schemes arranged through insurance companies and unit trusts where the unit holders are exclusively pension schemes.</p>

<p>The competent authorities may agree to include in the above, pension schemes of identical or substantially similar economic or legal nature which are introduced by way of statute or legislation in either State after the date of signature of the Convention.<br><br>
2. With reference to Article 4 (Resident):</p>

<p>a) It is understood that a collective investment vehicle, which is established and treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in Luxembourg and which receives income arising in the United Kingdom shall be treated for purposes of applying the Convention to such income as an individual who is a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof), but only to the extent that the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries. However, if at least 75 per cent of the beneficial interests in the collective investment vehicle are owned by equivalent beneficiaries, or if the collective investment vehicle is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) within the meaning of EU Directive 2009/65, the collective investment vehicle shall be treated as a resident of Luxembourg and as the beneficial owner of all of the income it receives (provided that a resident of Luxembourg receiving the income in the same circumstances would have been considered to be the beneficial owner thereof).</p>

<p>b) For the purposes of this paragraph the term “equivalent beneficiary” means a resident of Luxembourg, and a resident of any other jurisdiction with which the United Kingdom has arrangements that provide for effective and comprehensive information exchange who would, if he received the particular item of income for which benefits are being claimed under this Convention, be entitled under an income tax convention with the United Kingdom, to a rate of tax with respect to that item of income that is at least as low as the rate claimed under this Convention by the collective investment vehicle with respect to that item of income.</p>

<p>c) For the purposes of this paragraph of this Protocol, the term “collective investment vehicle” means:</p>

<p>(i) Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) subject to Part I of the law of 17 December 2010;</p>

<p>(ii) Undertakings for Collective Investment subject to Part II of the law of 17 December 2010;</p>

<p>(iii) Specialised Investment Funds (SIF) subject to the law of 13 February 2007; and</p>

<p>(iv) Reserved Alternative Investment Funds (RAIF) subject to the law of 23 July 2016, with the exception of reserved alternative investment funds which choose to subject themselves to the regime of Article 48 of the said law,</p>

<p>as well as any other investment fund, arrangement or entity established in Luxembourg which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to regard as a collective investment vehicle.<br><br>
3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 4 (Resident):</p>

<p>It is understood that in applying this provision, the competent authorities shall have regard to:</p>

<p>i) where the senior management of the person is carried on;</p>

<p>ii) where the meetings of the board of directors or equivalent body are held;</p>

<p>iii) where the person’s headquarters are located;</p>

<p>iv) the extent and nature of the economic nexus of the person to each State; and</p>

<p>v) whether determining that the person is a resident of one of the Contracting States but not of the other State for the purposes of the Convention would carry the risk of an improper use of the Convention or inappropriate application of the domestic law of either State.</p>

<p>This list of factors is not exhaustive. The competent authorities will apply the provision on a case by case basis. As the facts upon which an agreement is reached may change over time the competent authorities may revisit agreements, particularly where there are significant changes in the relevant facts.</p>

<p>Where a company was resident in both Luxembourg and the United Kingdom under the domestic law of those countries before the entry into force of this Convention, and the status of that company was determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article IV of the prior Convention, the competent authorities of Luxembourg and the United Kingdom will not seek to revisit that determination so long as all the material facts remain the same. Where the material facts change after the entry into force of this Convention, and the competent authorities determine that for treaty purposes the company should be regarded as a resident of the other State (or the competent authorities do not reach a mutual agreement), that new determination (or the loss of treaty benefits pursuant to the absence of a mutual agreement) will apply only to income or gains arising after the new determination (or notice to the taxpayer of the absence of an agreement).<br><br>
4. With reference to Articles 10 (Dividends) and 11 (Interest):</p>

<p>It is understood that an authorised representative of an investment fund established in a Contracting State may submit a claim relating to the benefits afforded by the provisions of these Articles. The competent authorities may consult together with a view to putting arrangements in place which facilitate claims and resolving any doubts concerning eligibility.<br><br>
5. It is understood that:</p>

<p>Nothing in this Convention shall prevent Luxembourg from applying the provisions of Article 164ter of the income tax law or any other similar provision that amends or replaces the above-mentioned Article.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.</p>

<p>Done in duplicate at London this seventh day of June 2022 in the English and French languages, both texts being equally authoritative</p>
