Section 13.3 (our requirements for the use of electronic signatures) has been amended. In particular, the borrower in the case of a mortgage need not have a conveyancer acting for them; the dating of the deed can be done by any party’s conveyancer; and the certificate as to compliance with the requirements needs to be dated and signed by an individual conveyancer, their full name and firm must be added and the deed or deeds for which the certificate is given must be specified.</p>

              <p class="app-c-published-dates__change-note">Section 13 has been amended to clarify a few points. The only substantive amendment is to relax the requirement for all the parties to have conveyancers acting for them in the following situations: only the lender in the case of a discharge or release, the personal representatives in the case of an assent and the donor in the case of a power of attorney need have conveyancers acting for them. Note that this relaxation applies even where the deed was signed before this latest update.
