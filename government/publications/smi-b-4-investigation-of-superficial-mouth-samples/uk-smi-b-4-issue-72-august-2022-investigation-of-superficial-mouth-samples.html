<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> UK Standards for Microbiology Investigations (<abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>): scope and purpose</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Users of <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Primarily, <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> are intended as a general resource for practising professionals operating in the field of laboratory medicine and infection specialties in the UK. The generic term ‘microbiology’ is used to include the 2 General Medical Council (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>)-recognised specialties of medical microbiology (which includes bacteriology, mycology and parasitology) and medical virology.</p>

<p><abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> provide clinicians with information about the available test repertoire and the standard of laboratory services they should expect for the investigation of infection in their patients, as well as providing information that aids the electronic ordering of appropriate tests.</p>

<p>These documents also provide commissioners of healthcare services with the appropriateness and standard of microbiology investigations they should be seeking as part of the clinical and public health care package for their population.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Background to <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> comprise a collection of recommended algorithms and procedures covering all stages of the investigative process in microbiology from the pre-analytical (clinical syndrome) stage to the analytical (laboratory testing) and post-analytical (result interpretation and reporting) stages.</p>

<p>Syndromic algorithms are supported by more detailed documents containing advice on the investigation of specific diseases and infections. Guidance notes cover the clinical background, differential diagnosis, and appropriate investigation of particular clinical conditions. Quality guidance notes describe laboratory processes that underpin quality, for example, assay validation.</p>

<p>Standardisation of the diagnostic process through the application of <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> helps to assure the equivalence of investigation strategies in different laboratories across the UK and is essential for public health surveillance, research and development activities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Equal partnership working</h3>

<p>UK <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> are developed in equal partnership with the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), the Royal College of Pathologists and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-standards-for-microbiology-investigations-smi-quality-and-consistency-in-clinical-laboratories">professional societies</a>. Inclusion of a logo in an <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> indicates the participation of the society in equal partnership and support for the objectives and process of preparing <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Nominees of professional societies are members of the steering committee and working groups which develop <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>. The views of nominees cannot be rigorously representative of the members of their nominating organisations nor the corporate views of their organisations. Nominees act as a conduit for 2-way reporting and dialogue. Representative views are sought through the consultation process. <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> are developed, reviewed and updated through a wide consultation process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Quality assurance</h3>

<p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>) has accredited the process used by the <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> working groups to produce <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>. The accreditation is applicable to all guidance produced since October 2009. The process for the development of <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> is certified to ISO 9001:2008.</p>

<p><abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> represent a good standard of practice to which all clinical and public health microbiology laboratories in the UK are expected to work. <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> are <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> accredited and represent neither minimum standards of practice nor the highest level of complex laboratory investigation possible. In using <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>, laboratories should take account of local requirements and undertake additional investigations where appropriate. <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> help laboratories to meet accreditation requirements by promoting high quality practices that are auditable.</p>

<p><abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> also provide a reference point for method development. The performance of <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> depends on competent staff and appropriate quality reagents and equipment. Laboratories should ensure that all commercial and in-house tests have been validated and shown to be fit for purpose. Laboratories should participate in external quality assessment schemes and undertake relevant internal quality control procedures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Patient and public involvement</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> working groups are committed to patient and public involvement in the development of <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>. By involving the public, health professionals, scientists, and voluntary organisations the resulting <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> will be robust and meet the needs of the user. An opportunity is given to members of the public to contribute to consultations through our open access website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Information governance and equality</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is a Caldicott-compliant organisation. It seeks to take every possible precaution to prevent unauthorized disclosure of patient details and to ensure that patient-related records are kept under secure conditions. The development of <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> is subject to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england/about/equality-and-diversity"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Equality objectives</a>.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span> Scope of document</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Type of specimen</h3>

<h4>Mouth swab, saliva and oral rinse</h4>

<p>This <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> describes the processing and bacteriological and mycological investigation of superficial mouth samples. Predominately mouth swabs but saliva and oral rinses are also covered. Infections of salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual) include bacterial and viral infections and are not covered in this <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr>.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> should be used in conjunction with other <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>Infections of the oral mucosa usually present as acute conditions. Usually, these arise from the colonising oral flora but can also result from a flare-up of a chronic low-grade infection.</p>

<p>Oral mucosal infections are typically associated with biofilms formed on the inanimate surfaces present in the oral cavity such as the teeth and dentures.</p>

<p>Infections of the gingiva (gingivitis, including acute ulcerative gingivitis) and periodontal tissues (periodontitis) are the most common forms of oral infection and processing specimens from these infections are covered in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smi-b-14-investigation-of-abscesses-and-deep-seated-wound-infections">UK <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> B 14: investigation of pus and exudates</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Oral mucositis</h3>

<p>Oral mucositis is a painful complication of chemotherapy or head and neck radiotherapy, caused by direct cytotoxicity of the treatment regime. Super-infection usually with yeasts and oral bacteria can exacerbate the problem and microbiological examination can help to guide symptomatic treatment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Erythematous and pseudomembranous candidosis</h3>

<p>Erythematous and pseudomembranous candidosis  (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref1">1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref2">2</a>) are the most frequent clinical presentations of oral fungal infection. The infections may involve the mucosal surfaces of the cheeks, tongue (dorsal and ventral surfaces) and both hard and soft palates. The most common cause is Candida albicans. Candida species other than C. albicans such as Candida glabrata may also be isolated, either alone or in combination with C. albicans. This is especially common in the medically compromised or those with a history of prolonged antifungal therapy (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref3">3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref4">4</a>).</p>

<p>Atrophic candidosis (denture stomatitis) may occur in the palatal mucosa below the fitting surface of dentures, especially when patients sleep with their dentures in place and/or have xerostomia. Candida species other than C. albicans are important to identify since they may demonstrate reduced susceptibility and clinical resistance to the first-line anti-fungal agents and may be responsible for refractory or recurrent infections. Rarely, moulds may colonize and infect sinuses and result in palatal erosion. Specimens in the form of an oral rinse (known volume of sterile saline) are used to quantitatively determine colonisation or infection <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref5">(5)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Angular cheilitis and peri-oral infections</h3>

<p>Angular cheilitis and peri-oral infections are common infections affecting the angles of the mouth and lips, usually caused by an intra-oral reservoir of infection, typically biofilms associated with denture stomatitis. Infection may be due to S. aureus, Candida species and/or group A streptococci. It is common for dentate patients with angular cheilitis to have infection with both S. aureus and C. albicans in the labial commissure region. Swabs should be taken from the lesions themselves. Swabs should also be collected from relevant intra-oral sites, for example, denture-fitting surface and the anterior nares to identify sites of colonisation to be treated with eradication therapy, to reduce relapse rates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Staphylococcal mucositis</h3>

<p>Patients who are severely medically compromised and have reduced salivary flow, together with parenteral feeding, may develop staphylococcal mucositis caused by  S. aureus. Enterobacteria may also play a role in severe cases. The erythematous changes in the oral mucosa may be indistinguishable clinically from candidosis, requiring the need for microbiological investigation. Results should be interpreted in a clinical context since asymptomatic carriage of S. aureus or Enterobacteria may occur. Strict regular oral hygiene measures are usually sufficient to resolve clinical symptoms. Systemic antibiotics are not usually required although may play an important role in the management of severe oral mucositis in some patient groups such as the terminally ill <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref6">(6)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Oral ulceration</h3>

<p>There are many non-infective causes of oral ulceration such as traumatic ulcers, recurrent aphthous ulcers, inflammatory conditions and malignant lesions. Infective causes of oral ulceration are commonly viral in origin (for example, Herpes simplex). Uncommon bacterial causes of ulceration are syphilis and tuberculosis whilst other rare causes of oral ulceration include fungal infections such as histoplasmosis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Vincent’s angina</h3>

<p>Borrelia vincentii and Fusobacterium species are associated with the infection known as Vincent’s angina. It is characterised by ulceration of the pharynx or gums and occurs in adults with poor mouth hygiene or serious systemic disease <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref7">(7)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/standards-for-microbiology-investigations-smi#bacteriology">B 9 – Investigation of throat-related specimens</a> provides more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Technical information and limitations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Limitations of UK <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The recommendations made in UK <abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> are based on evidence (for example, sensitivity and specificity) where available, expert opinion and pragmatism, with consideration, also being given to available resources. Laboratories should take account of local requirements and undertake additional investigations where appropriate. Prior to use, laboratories should ensure that all commercial and in-house tests have been validated and are fit for purpose.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Selective media in screening procedures</h3>

<p>Selective media which does not support the growth of all circulating strains of organisms may be recommended based on the evidence available. A balance therefore must be sought between available evidence, and available resources required if more than one media plate is used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Specimen containers</h3>

<p><abbr title="Standards for Microbiology Investigations">SMIs</abbr> use the term ‘CE marked leakproof container’ to describe containers bearing the CE marking used for the collection and transport of clinical specimens  (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">8</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">9</a>). The requirements for specimen containers are given in the EU in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC Annex 1 B 2.1) which states: “The design must allow easy handling and, where necessary, reduce as far as possible contamination of and leakage from, the device during use and, in the case of specimen receptacles, the risk of contamination of the specimen. The manufacturing processes must be appropriate for these purposes”.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Safety considerations</h2>
<p>This section covers specific safety considerations related to this UK <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">(8 to 24)</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Specimen collection, transport and storage <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">(8 to 13)</a>
</h3>

<p>Use aseptic technique.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Collect saliva and oral rinse specimens into appropriate CE-marked leakproof containers and transport specimens in sealed plastic bags.</li>
  <li>Use tubes with a transport medium for transporting swabs and transport in sealed plastic bags <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref25">(25)</a>.</li>
  <li>Transport each swab in transport medium in a CE-marked container in a sealed plastic bag.</li>
  <li>Compliance with postal, transport, and storage regulations is essential.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Specimen processing</h3>

<ol>
  <li>All Hazard group 2 organisms must be confirmed at Containment Level 2.</li>
  <li>Laboratory procedures that give rise to infectious aerosols must be conducted in a microbiological safety cabinet <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref16">(16)</a>.</li>
  <li>Refer to current guidance on the safe handling of all organisms documented in this <abbr title="Standard for Microbiology Investigations">SMI</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If there is histoplasma (and/or other relevant dimorphic pathogens causing oral ulceration) risk then Containment Level 3 is required using an appropriate cabinet.</li>
  <li>The above guidance should be supplemented with local COSHH and risk assessments.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Specimen collection</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Type of specimens</h3>

<p>Mouth swab, saliva and oral rinse</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Optimal time and method of collection</h3>

<p>For safety considerations refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#coll">section 5.1</a>.</p>

<p>Collect specimens before starting antimicrobial therapy where possible <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref26">(26)</a>.</p>

<p>To assure that the preconditions of the sampling for oral infections are comparable it is advised that patients should not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eat or drink within 2 hours</li>
  <li>brush their teeth within 2 hours</li>
  <li>use any mouth rinse of disinfectant within 2 hours prior to sampling</li>
</ul>

<p>If possible samples should be taken in the morning under fasting conditions.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated collect each swab for bacterial and/or fungal culture and place in appropriate transport medium (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref25">25</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref27">27</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref28">28</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref29">29</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref30">30</a>).</p>

<p>Collect specimens other than swabs into appropriate CE-marked leakproof containers and place in sealed plastic bags.</p>

<p>Sample any lesions or inflamed areas using cotton-tipped swabs. Samples of denture fitting surfaces should also be swabbed as these are more sensitive sites than the palatal mucosa to recover Candida species. The use of a tongue depressor or spatula may be helpful. Oral rinses can be useful to follow up level of colonisation. These are collected by rinsing with 10ml of sterile saline for one minute.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Adequate quantity and appropriate number of specimens</h3>

<p>Numbers and frequency of specimens collected depend on the clinical condition of patient <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref26">(26)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Specimen transport and storage</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Optimal transport and storage conditions</h3>

<p>For safety considerations refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#coll">section 5.1</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specimens should be transported and processed as soon as possible <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref26">(26)</a>.</li>
  <li>Collect mucosal swabs in transport medium which should be transported and processed as soon as possible. If processing is delayed, refrigeration is preferable to storage at ambient temperature.</li>
  <li>Oral rinses should be transported in a CE-marked leakproof container and placed in sealed plastic bags and processed as soon as possible (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">8</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref9">9</a>).</li>
</ol>

<span class="number">8. </span> Specimen processing and procedure</h2>

<p>Specimen processing and procedure (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">8</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8">9</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Test selection</h3>

<p>Most mouth samples are swabs unless the patient is immunocompromised or has other clinical indications.</p>

<p>Saliva samples may be collected for microbiological investigation and for other types of assessment. Increasingly saliva is being used as a sample for new diagnostic techniques, but also for assessing xerostomia and risk of dental caries. Care is needed to avoid contamination of these specimens and cross infection from these specimens. Sometimes culture is done with an exact volume of saliva in order to assess the count of a particular organism (for example, S. mutans or lactobacilli per ml of the original saliva sample.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Appearance</h3>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Sample preparation</h3>

<p>For safety considerations refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#spec">section 5.2</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>For oral rinses (saliva or mouth washings) centrifuge at 3,200 rpm for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Decant supernatant into disinfectant and re-suspend the deposit in 1ml PBS. This is now the neat sample.</li>
  <li>Inoculate 50µl onto a Sabouraud agar plate using a hockey stick to spread out for single colonies and a columbia agar plate.</li>
</ol>

<p>For comparison it is sometimes useful to dilute neat sample 1:100 (0.1ml + 9.9ml PBS). Inoculate 50µl onto a Columbia Blood Agar and use a hockey stick to spread out. A MacConkey/Cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar (<abbr title="cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar">CLED</abbr>) plate may also be useful.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Microscopy</h3>

<p>Direct microscopic examination with Calcofluor staining may be helpful if histoplasma or mould infection is suspected.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span> Culture and investigation</h3>

<p>Inoculate each agar plate using a sterile loop or a loopful of liquid (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/standards-for-microbiology-investigations-smi#quality-related-guidance">Q 5 - Inoculation of culture media for bacteriology</a>).</p>

<p>For the isolation of individual colonies, spread inoculum with a sterile loop.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Notification to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> or equivalent in the devolved administrations</h2>

<p>The Health Protection (Notification) regulations 2010 require diagnostic laboratories to notify <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref31">31 to 36</a>) when they identify the causative agents that are listed in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Notifications must be provided in writing, on paper or electronically, within 7 days. Urgent cases should be notified orally and as soon as possible, recommended within 24 hours. These should be followed up by written notification within 7 days.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the Notification Regulations, the recipient of laboratory notifications is the local <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Health Protection Team. If a case has already been notified by a registered medical practitioner, the diagnostic laboratory is still required to notify the case if they identify any evidence of an infection caused by a notifiable causative agent.</p>

<p>Notification under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 does not replace voluntary reporting to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. The vast majority of <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> laboratories voluntarily report a wide range of laboratory diagnoses of causative agents to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and many <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Health protection Teams have agreements with local laboratories for urgent reporting of some infections.

<p><sup>†</sup>If histoplasmosis is suspected the length of incubation should be extended and carried out in Category 3 conditions.</p>

<p>If an unusual fungal infection is suspected a second Sabouraud plate should be set up at 30°C and incubation time extended.</p>

<h3>Accessible text version of the flowchart</h3>

<h4>Specimen</h4>

<p>The specimen can follow 1. the standard media pathway or 2. the supplementary media pathways.</p>

<h4>1. The standard media pathway</h4>

<p>Specimens should be cultured onto Sabouraud agar, incubated at 35 to 37°C in air for 40 hours or onto blood agar incubated at 35 to 37°C in 5 to 10% CO2 for 24 hours. (If Histoplasmosis is suspected on Sabouraud agar the length of incubation should be extended and carried out in Category 3 conditions.)</p>

<p>If an unusual fungal infection is suspected a second Sabouraud plate should be set up at 30°C and incubation time extended.</p>

<h4>Results for the standard media pathway</h4>

<p>Results on Sabouraud agar indicate C. albicans, non albicans yeast.</p>

<p>Results on blood agar indicate Group A strep, S. aureus and coliforms.</p>

<h4>2. The supplementary media pathway</h4>

<p>Specimens should be cultured onto MacConkey or <abbr title="cystine lactose electrolyte deficient agar">CLED</abbr> agar and incubated at 35 to 37’C in air for 24 hours.</p>

<h4>Results for the supplementary media pathway</h4>

<p>Results indicate coliforms, non fermentative Gram negative.</p>

The requirements for specimen containers are given in the EU in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC Annex 1 B 2.1) which states: “The design must allow easy handling and, where necessary, reduce as far as possible contamination of, and leakage from, the device during use and, in the case of specimen receptacles, the risk of contamination of the specimen. The manufacturing processes must be appropriate for these purposes”.</p>
