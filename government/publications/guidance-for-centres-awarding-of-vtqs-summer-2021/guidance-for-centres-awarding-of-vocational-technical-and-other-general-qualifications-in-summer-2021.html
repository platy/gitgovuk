<h2>About this document</h2>

<p>This document is for those working in colleges, training providers and other settings where assessments for vocational and technical (VTQs) qualifications, and general qualifications other than <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gcse-as-and-a-level-qualifications-in-2021" class="govuk-link">GCSE, AS, A level, AEA and Project</a> (or ‘other general qualifications’) are scheduled to take place in summer 2021.</p>

<p>In this guidance we explain the awarding of VTQs and other general qualifications this summer. We outline what we expect from awarding organisations and what you should expect to happen over the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Awarding is different in summer 2021</h2>

<p>The ongoing impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the cancellation of external assessments for some Vocational and Technical Qualifications (VTQs) and other general qualifications. For other VTQs, awarding organisations have adapted assessments to take account of public health requirements and the needs of employers.</p>

<p>We have asked awarding organisations to carefully balance mitigating the effects of the pandemic with the need to provide fair and reliable results that allow learners to progress. We are continuing to work closely with awarding organisations and sector bodies so that colleges, training providers and schools are provided with the information they need to implement these approaches fairly and consistently. In turn, we expect awarding organisations to work collaboratively together and with stakeholders and centres in developing their approaches to awarding.</p>

<p>We know that in some cases the implementation of these arrangements is not without its challenges, especially when we are all living and working within the necessary public health restrictions.</p>

<p>You will know that the VTQ landscape is complex. Unlike GCSEs and A levels, there is no single approach to awarding that would work for all types of VTQs because of the very different qualification structures and assessment methods used.</p>

<p>We have put in place some common principles to support consistency across similar qualifications. Some awarding organisations have worked together to promote consistency in similar qualifications where appropriate. However, it is inevitable that there will be some variation in approach, although where there are differences, this is for a good reason.</p>

<p>We are working with awarding organisations to put in place arrangements that support the safe delivery of their assessments. Some assessments will continue to take place while other results will be based partly, or wholly, on teacher judgement. These arrangements are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vocational-and-technical-qualifications-contingency-regulatory-framework" class="govuk-link">Vocational and Technical Qualifications Regulatory Framework</a> (the VCRF).</p>

<p>It is important that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Results secure public confidence. Education providers and employers can be confident this year’s results will carry the same currency as previous and future years.</li>
  <li>Learners receiving VTQ and other general qualification results this year are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged compared to learners studying for GCSEs, AS and A levels.</li>
</ol>

<p>We expect that the majority of learners who planned to take exams and assessments this summer so that they could progress to either further or higher education or to employment, will receive a result. We recognise that, for various reasons, it may not be possible for all learners who were expecting to take an assessment this summer to receive a result – they might have to wait for the next available assessment opportunity.</p>

<p>For the purposes of awarding VTQs and other general qualifications, we have divided qualifications into three main categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Qualifications that require a demonstration of occupational or professional competence or proficiency.</li>
  <li>Qualifications that are similar to, or delivered alongside, GCSEs, AS and A levels and which are used for progression to further or higher education.</li>
  <li>Other qualifications used for progression which are different from GCSEs, AS and A levels.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have published a qualifications explainer tool which enables centres and learners to easily <a href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/apps/AllQualifications/summer2021tool/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">search for qualifications and find information about how results will be determined</a> for all Ofqual-regulated qualifications this year.</p>

<h2>Learners these arrangements apply to</h2>

<p>These arrangements apply to both certificating and non-certificating learners in England, including those learners taking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualifications similar to or delivered alongside GCSEs, AS and A levels</li>
  <li>other qualifications used for progression which are different from GCSEs, AS and A levels who were expecting to sit assessments between 1 August 2020 and 31 August 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>These arrangements should allow, where possible, learners taking qualifications to access a result which may include using a teacher-assessed grade or alternative approach to awarding where appropriate.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must be sure that they only issue results to learners who were intending to sit assessments this year</li>
  <li>will need to work with centres to verify those learners</li>
  <li>may choose to issue results under these arrangements for learners who are due to be awarded a relevant qualification outside England</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have learners taking a qualification internationally, please contact your awarding organisation for further information.</p>

<h2>Qualifications that require a demonstration of occupation or professional competence or proficiency</h2>

<p>For some qualifications, such as those that assess occupational competency, professional competency, or act as a licence to practise, it would not be safe to award these qualifications without the necessary skills and knowledge having been formally tested. Providing a result that signals competence when that has not been evidenced to the usual expected standards creates risks, including those relating to health and safety. It could mean that a learner does not possess the skills required by the role to which the qualification relates or does not meet the standards set by professional bodies or in regulations. Therefore, awarding organisations can only issue results for these qualifications based on assessment evidence from exams and/or internal assessments.</p>

<p>We have asked awarding organisations to carefully consider adaptations to assessments, enabling as many learners as possible to obtain a result, without undermining validity and reliability for these qualifications. You will notice that many of the adaptations that were put in place last year because of the pandemic still apply to the qualifications you are delivering. Additionally, awarding organisations may choose to apply further adaptations to mitigate the ongoing impact of the pandemic and enable you to comply with public health guidance.</p>

<p>The main adaptations that awarding organisations have chosen include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changing the way in which assessments are delivered, for example using an online rather than paper-based test, or carrying out an assessment remotely rather than face to face</li>
  <li>adapting assessment methods, for example using a practical simulation in place of an observation, or professional discussion in place of a practical demonstration</li>
  <li>changing invigilation requirements, for example allowing the use of online invigilation</li>
  <li>waiving or adjusting work experience or placement requirements, for example allowing learners to undertake a shorter period of work experience</li>
  <li>changing the way in which a qualification is quality assured, for example allowing for remote or online standardisation or moderation, where this is a change to an assessment strategy</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be cases where it is not possible to adapt assessments. For example, where practical assessments which are required to demonstrate occupational competence for employment cannot be delivered safely in line with public health guidance. Under these circumstances, the awarding organisation may have no choice but to delay assessments.</p>

<p>We asked awarding organisations to ensure, as far as possible, that the adaptations applied minimise any disadvantage to learners. We do recognise however that there may still be some cases where learners are unable to access adapted assessments and there may be no alternative but to wait until the assessment can be rescheduled.</p>

<p>If a learner is unable to take an assessment for reasons outside their control, then awarding organisations may be able to apply Special Consideration. Please speak to your awarding organisation for further information.</p>

<h3>What this means for you</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/apps/AllQualifications/summer2021tool/" rel="external">qualifications explainer tool will give an overview of the approach being taken for qualifications</a> you are delivering.</li>
  <li>Your awarding organisation will provide information to support you in implementing their agreed adaptations and provide details of the arrangements that will need to be made for any learners who need reasonable adjustments or are unable to take an assessment.</li>
  <li>To make sure these arrangements are as manageable as possible for centres, we expect awarding organisations to use their normal quality assurance policies and procedures when assessments take place as normal or in an adapted form. Normal quality assurance procedures may be adapted to reflect current public health advice, for example on-site visits may be adapted to remote or virtual visits.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Qualifications that are similar to, or delivered alongside GCSEs, AS and A levels, and which are used for progression to further or higher education</h2>

<p>For these qualifications, we expect awarding organisations to use similar approaches to those used in the awarding of GCSEs, AS or A levels where possible and appropriate, using teacher-assessed grades. Examples of these qualifications are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/further-education-courses" class="govuk-link">Applied Generals, Technical Awards and Tech Levels</a></li>
  <li>other qualifications used in school and college performance measures</li>
  <li>Core Maths</li>
</ul>

<p>These qualifications vary in their size, assessment structures, grading structures and delivery models, and learners taking these qualifications may have completed different amounts of work and assessment. This means that awarding organisations may have to implement different approaches to determining results that are appropriate within different contexts.</p>

<p>We are working with awarding organisations to ensure that there is as much consistency in their approach as possible, despite these variations.</p>

<p>The overall approach to awarding will be the similar to GCSEs, AS and A levels, in that results can be based on teacher-assessed grades, but there will be some differences. For example, some awarding organisations may require component level teacher-assessed grades instead of qualification level teacher-assessed grades. There will also be some operational differences because AOs have different ways of working with their centres.</p>

<h3>Evidence to support teacher-assessed grades</h3>

<p>Teacher-assessed grades (also called TAGs) will be based on evidence of a learner’s achievement, with teachers drawing on a range of different types of appropriate evidence to inform their professional judgement about a learner’s result. The evidence used may vary depending on the qualification. Awarding organisations have considered the evidence that is available to them and developed the most appropriate approach for each qualification. Your awarding organisation will provide guidance to you on the evidence and process that should be used to determine teacher-assessed grades.</p>

<p>The evidence considered by a centre may include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Performance on any assessment for the qualification even if this has not been fully completed. Where relevant, an awarding organisation should encourage you to support learners to complete internal and non-exam assessments as far as possible, and for you to mark those assessments.</li>
  <li>Performance on any class or homework assessments and mock exams taken over the course of study.</li>
  <li>Records of the learner’s performance over the course of study in the relevant qualification. This may include progress review data, classwork, and participation in practical activities, demonstrations and performances.</li>
  <li>Any other relevant evidence.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Department for Education is clear that teaching and learning should continue for as long as possible, and cover as much of the qualification content as possible. This is to help equip learners as fully as possible for their future employment and educational settings. Therefore, you should continue covering the qualification content and setting and marking work, and providing feedback to learners on work completed, even where this might form part of the evidence for a teacher-assessed grade. You are encouraged to discuss with your learners the evidence that will be used to determine teacher-assessed grades so they can understand their own role in achieving their result.</p>

<p>For qualifications which include some occupational elements, awarding organisations may also need to specify particular internal assessments that must be completed to ensure the valid award of the qualification.</p>

<p>If you do not have sufficient evidence upon which to base a teacher-assessed grade for a given learner, then please get in touch with your awarding organisation. If it is not possible to find additional evidence, it will not be possible to issue a result and the learner will have to wait until the next available assessment opportunity.</p>

<h3>Learners who sat or expected to sit exams in January 2021</h3>

<p>For those qualifications most like GCSEs, AS and A levels, all learners will be able to progress, irrespective of whether they sat an exam in January.</p>

<p>We want to ensure fairness for learners who sat or who expected to sit exams in January, certificating learners and learners not certificating in summer 2021 (for example in the first year of their study).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learners who were absent from January examinations will be able to receive a result based on a teacher-assessed grade or alternative approach to awarding.</li>
  <li>Learners who sat the examinations, but found that the disruption caused by the pandemic in January adversely affected their ability to demonstrate their attainment, will be able to receive a result based on a teacher-assessed grade or alternative approach to awarding.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please contact your awarding organisation for further guidance on their approach to issuing results to learners who took or were expecting to take assessments in January 2021.</p>

<h2>Other qualifications used for progression which are different from GCSEs or A levels</h2>

<p>For these qualifications we expect awarding organisations to make exams and internal assessments available to learners.</p>

<p>If learners are not able to safely access exams and internal assessments, either in person in line with public health guidance, or remotely, then they may be able to receive a result through a different approach to awarding, including the use of teacher-assessed grades. Your awarding organisation will provide guidance to you on how to determine eligibility for teacher-assessed grades for these qualifications, and the evidence and process that should be used to determine these grades.</p>

<p>Examples of these qualifications are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional Skills</li>
  <li>English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Skills for Life qualifications</li>
  <li>Essential Digital Skills qualifications</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functional Skills qualifications</h3>

<p>Awarding organisations have put in place a range of approaches to give learners as much opportunity as possible to take assessments. The table below shows the range of assessment options offered for Functional Skills offered by each awarding organisation. Contact your awarding organisation to find out more about the arrangements they have put in place. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/awarding-of-functional-skills-in-2021" class="govuk-link">Further details for functional skills qualifications</a> can be found on our website.</p>

<h2>Retaining evidence of teacher-assessed grades</h2>

<p>You are required to keep all evidence used in the determination of a teacher-assessed grade until 6 months after either the results issue date, or the conclusion of any appeal in relation to that result, whichever is later.</p>

<h2>Objective judgements of teacher-assessed grades</h2>

<p>Awarding organisations must ensure that you have judged the teacher-assessed grades appropriately. Awarding organisations must also take steps to ensure that the teacher-assessed grade is based on the centre’s judgement as to learners’ actual level of attainment based on the appropriate evidence. We have provided <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-for-centres-about-making-objective-judgements" class="govuk-link">information to support the making of objective judgements</a> which can be found on our website.</p>

<h2>Quality assurance of teacher-assessed grades</h2>

<p>A centre’s and awarding organisation’s quality assurance processes are both important parts of the awarding process because they ensure that there is some consistency in the judgements being made by different teachers in different subjects or in different centres. Your awarding organisation will provide you with details of the quality assurance processes that they will apply. They will also provide guidance for you on how to carry out internal quality assurance.</p>

<p>Your awarding organisation will require your centre to have a clear approach for carrying out internal quality assurance of your teacher-assessed grades before these are submitted to your awarding organisation. Your awarding organisation may wish to review your policies and procedures this as part of their quality assurance processes before you submit any teacher-assessed grades. Many awarding organisations will expect you to complete and return a ‘head of centre declaration’ when you submit any teacher-assessed grades to confirm that you have complied with your internal quality assurance arrangements.</p>

<p>Your quality assurance approach should include a check of grades against previous cohorts at the centre who took the assessment for the same qualification in previous years. You know the level at which your students are working and how that compares with the outcomes your students have received in previous years. You should use this knowledge and the supporting data to check that the grades you submit reflect the evidence that underpins them.</p>

<p>Your teacher-assessed grades should be reviewed by other subject teachers and assessors as well as the relevant head of department or head of centre before submission. Your SENCO may also take part in the review.</p>

<h3>What this means for you</h3>

<p>Your awarding organisation will provide guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the range of evidence that could be considered in the judgement of a teacher-assessed grade</li>
  <li>the process to follow when determining teacher-assessed grades</li>
  <li>ensuring decisions are consistent</li>
  <li>internal quality assurance requirements</li>
  <li>the application of reasonable adjustments and special consideration</li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance from awarding organisations could take the form of exemplification materials or other materials to support you when evaluating the evidence for teacher-assessed grades.</p>

<p>Your awarding organisation may ask for additional information from you to assist with their quality assurance. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when learners are expecting to take assessments and receive certification, so the correct learners are issued with results</li>
  <li>details of your approach to internal quality assurance</li>
  <li>a rationale to support the results profile</li>
  <li>samples of the evidence on which teacher-assessed grades are based</li>
</ul>

<p>Your awarding organisation will not issue a result until any issues identified as part of its quality assurance processes have been resolved satisfactorily.</p>

<h2>Apprenticeship end-point assessments</h2>

<p>The flexibilities for the assessment of apprenticeships are being overseen by the <a rel="external" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/" class="govuk-link">Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education</a>. They have published more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/covid-19-information-regarding-apprenticeships/" rel="external">details and guidance applying to apprenticeships</a>.</p>

<h2>Preventing errors and unfair advantage</h2>

<p>None of us want things to go wrong or any learners to experience further disruption this summer. We expect that awarding organisations will be very alert to risks, and we expect them to do all they can to prevent errors and to put things right as quickly as possible. We have asked awarding organisations to remain vigilant to the risk of malpractice.</p>

<p>We expect every effort to be taken to prevent any learner gaining an unfair advantage through these arrangements and we expect awarding organisations to continue to take active steps to prevent malpractice and to investigate and address any suspected malpractice or other improper behaviour. Awarding organisations are also obliged to promptly report any incidents to Ofqual and we will monitor their response.</p>

<h2>Cyber-security</h2>

<p>Many qualifications will be awarded through teacher-assessed grades this year and any cyber-attacks could have a greater than usual impact.</p>

<p>We know attacks in previous years have prevented centres from accessing student work. This year, a cyber-attack could result in centres being unable to access student work, records of student work, the teacher-assessed grades, or could prevent teacher-assessed grades being uploaded to awarding organisations. This could create risk to students receiving their results on time.</p>

<p>We expect centres and awarding organisations to be aware of this risk and take appropriate precautions such as regularly backing-up data and making sure anti-viral and anti-ransomware systems are up to date.</p>

<p>If you would like further information, the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/education-skills/cyber-security-schools" rel="external" class="govuk-link">National Cyber Security Centre has a range of practical advice and resources</a> on improving cyber security in centres.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Most results will continue to be issued to normal timescales. Where VTQ results are used to support progression to further or higher study, results for level 2 qualifications should be issued no later than GCSEs on 12 August 2021 and results for level 3 qualifications should be issued no later than AS and A level results on 10 August 2021. This is so that no learner who is hoping to progress onto further or higher education is disadvantaged.</p>

<h3>What this means for you</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Your awarding organisations will confirm their results days.</li>
  <li>The results of on-demand qualifications will continue be awarded in line with current timescales.</li>
  <li>You should receive results data in good time to allow you to prepare for the distribution of results on the correct days.</li>
  <li>Please ensure that you have the right people and resources available at your centre who can respond to queries from learners, and the awarding organisation if necessary, and help prepare for the distribution of results.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Appeals</h2>

<p>Appeals procedures put in place by awarding organisations may be different this year, to reflect the requirements of these arrangements.</p>

<p>Where results for a qualification will be awarded based on teacher-assessed grades, learners should be able to appeal on the same basis as GCSE, AS and A level learners. This means that a learner could appeal on the basis that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the centre did not follow its procedure properly and consistently in arriving at the learner’s result (including any failure of quality assurance) or in conducting its review</li>
  <li>the result reflects an unreasonable exercise of academic judgement on the part of the centre</li>
  <li>the awarding organisation made an administrative error in relation to the result</li>
</ul>

<p>While the appeals approach for these qualifications is expected to be available on the same basis as for GCSEs and A levels, the exact processes that need to be followed may be different across different awarding organisations. In most cases centres will conduct an initial review of the teacher-assessed grade ahead of any appeal being submitted to the awarding organisation. Awarding organisations will provide information to centres on the detail of the appeals approach that will apply for their qualifications where awards are based on teacher-assessed grades.</p>

<p>For qualifications not being awarded on the basis of a teacher-assessed grade, normal appeals arrangements are likely to apply. If you remain dissatisfied following the appeals process, you can contact us to make a complaint.</p>

<h2>Additional assessment opportunities</h2>
<p>We are requiring awarding organisations who normally provide assessment opportunities between September and January, to make those assessments available to learners who received a result through a teacher-assessed grade but want to improve their grade, as well as those who would ordinarily take an assessment at that time.</p>

<p>Where awarding organisations do not normally provide assessment opportunities between September and January, we are requiring them to provide those opportunities where they reasonably consider there is sufficient demand and would be manageable to both the awarding organisation and centres.</p>

<p>We expect awarding organisations to work with centres, and to take decisions in the best interests of learners. We may intervene if we decide there is a particular need for an assessment that is not being met by awarding organisations.</p>

<h3>What this means for you</h3>

<p>You should contact your awarding organisation in the first instance to find out their plans for additional assessment opportunities.</p>

<h2>Key dates</h2>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>You should refer to your awarding organisation for detailed timelines and submission dates for teacher-assessed grades for VTQ and other general qualifications.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">18 June </span> 2021</h3>

<p>Deadline for the submission of teacher-assessed grades for GCSEs, AS and A levels. Some VTQ awarding organisations are also setting this as the date for the submission of teacher-assessed grades.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10 August </span> 2021</h3>

<p>Results day for A levels and some level 3 VTQs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12 August </span> 2021</h3>

<p>Results day for GCSEs and some level 2 VTQs.</p>

<h2>Closure of the Extraordinary Regulatory Framework (ERF) and the Extended Extraordinary Framework (Extended ERF)</h2>

<p>We have closed the frameworks that have operated since March 2020, but learners who received calculated results last year (or who have deferred calculated results) will still be able to carry them forward into their qualification result this summer and beyond.</p>

<p>Any appeals that are ongoing under these frameworks can also be continued. Awarding organisations are now operating under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vocational-and-technical-qualifications-contingency-regulatory-framework" class="govuk-link">Vocational and Technical Qualifications Contingency Regulatory Framework</a> (VCRF).</p>

<p>For further details, please see the results of our consultation, ‘<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/regulatory-arrangements-for-the-awarding-of-vocational-and-technical-and-other-general-qualifications-in-2020-2021" class="govuk-link">Regulatory arrangements for the awarding of vocational and technical and other general qualifications in 2020 to 2021</a>’.</p>
