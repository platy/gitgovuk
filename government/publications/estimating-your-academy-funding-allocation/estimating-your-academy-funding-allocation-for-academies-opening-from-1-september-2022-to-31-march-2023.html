<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Before a school opens as an academy, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) provides details of their revenue funding, known as the general annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>), in a draft allocation statement. Academies are funded in line with their funding agreements. This guide explains how to estimate your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> before receiving your draft statement. It includes links to online data and contains examples to help explain how to estimate your funding.</p>

<p>This guide is designed for schools converting to become academies, and schools becoming sponsored academies, between 1 September 2022 and 31 March 2023.</p>

<p>For free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (<abbr title="university technical colleges">UTCs</abbr>) we have published further supporting information to assist you to estimate your funding:</p>

</ul>

<h2>General annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>): mainstream academies</h2>

<p><abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> is revenue funding and is used by academies to meet their day-to-day running costs. The main element of this funding is the pre-16 school budget share (<abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Funding outside the <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>
</h2>

<p>As an academy, you will receive other revenue funding that is not as part of your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. Some non-<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> funding has not been confirmed for 2022 to 2023, this section will be updated as grants are confirmed.</p>

<p>Currently confirmed are:</p>

<h3>Risk protection arrangement</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-for-academy-trusts-membership-rules">risk protection arrangement (<abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr>)</a> is an alternative to commercial insurance for academies and local authority maintained schools (<abbr title="local authority maintained schools">LAMS</abbr>). Under <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr>, the government covers the losses instead of commercial insurance.</p>

<p>Schools converting to academy status will be signed up automatically to the <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> scheme, irrespective of if they are a member of the <abbr title="local authority maintained schools">LAMS</abbr> <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> scheme. However, if the school <strong>does not</strong> wish to join the <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> scheme, they should inform their DfE contact, who will arrange this with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>. The cost of joining the scheme is £21 per pupil per year.</p>

<p>After conversion, the <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> team will provide those academies joining <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> with details of their <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> membership certificate and other relevant documentation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you opt in, RPA will <strong>not</strong> be shown on your allocation statement as it does not affect your allocation, however it will affect the amount you will receive each month.</p>
</div>

<p>You can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-for-schools">online form</a>  to join the <abbr title="risk protection arrangement">RPA</abbr> arrangements (via DfE Sign-in).</p>

<h2>Funding for new academies opening after 1 September 2022</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr> for the 2022 to 2023 academic year will be the same as your predecessor school for the 2022 to 2023 financial year.</p>

<p>Funding is prorated until the end of the academic year, 31 August 2023. It does not include funding for rates, insurance and early years funding that your local authority allocated to your maintained predecessor if applicable.</p>

<p>Sixth form funding and start-up grants are all based on the 2022 to 2023 academic year rates.</p>

<p>High needs place funding is based on the 2022 to 2023 financial year rates.</p>

<h3>Estimating your pre-16 school budget share</h3>

<p>You can estimate your <abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr> by calculating a daily school’s block allocation and multiplying it by the number of remaining days in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. To illustrate, for a school that converts on 1 October 2022:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open your schools funding document supplied from your local authority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the total figure remove the rates and de-delegation funding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the prorated allocation using the following method:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
<abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr> prorated amount</td>
      <td>£9,589.04 × 335 = £3,212,328.77</td>
      <td>This is the <abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr> daily amount multiplied by the number of days the school is open for (1 October 2022 to the end of the 2022 to 2023 academic year, 31 August 2023)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3>Estimating your sixth form funding</h3>

<p>You can estimate your sixth form funding by calculating a monthly allocation and multiplying by the number of remaining months in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>For example, for an academy that opens on 1 October 2022:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Funding data will be available from your 16 to 19 funding documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the prorated allocation using the following method in the table below:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Factor</th>
      <th scope="col">Calculation</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Total funding allocation</td>
      <td>£500,000</td>
      <td>Can be found from predecessor school documentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form funding per month amount</td>
      <td>£500,000 ÷ 12 = £41,666.67</td>
      <td>This is the total funding allocation divided by the number of months in the year (12 months)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form funding prorated amount</td>
      <td>£41,666.67 × 11 = £458,333.37</td>
      <td>This is the sixth form funding amount multiplied by the number of months the school is open for (1 October 2022 to the end of the 2022 to 2023 academic year, 31 August 2023)</td>
    </tr>

<h3>Estimating your high needs unit places in mainstream schools</h3>

<p>Some mainstream schools receive high needs place funding. Pre-16 places occupied by pupils recorded on the school census as sole or dual (main) are funded at £6,000. Pupils in these places will also attract funding through the mainstream school formula.</p>

<p>Other places are funded at £10,000 and are categorised as unoccupied. This may apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the place is or will be occupied by a pupil registered on the roll of another school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a place is not occupied at the time of the school census count, but is likely to be filled and requires funding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>spare capacity is required for another reason</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 2021 to 2022 section 251 high needs and alternative provision (September to March) maintained schools data sets out your current high needs places.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This will be used to determine your funding allocation in draft GAGs and upon conversion. If this data is incorrect, please notify your local authority and advise the DfE project lead overseeing the conversion.</p>
</div>

<p>You can estimate your high needs place funding by calculating a daily allocation and multiplying the number of remaining days in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>To illustrate, for a mainstream school, with 10 unoccupied places and 5 occupied places, that converts on 1 October 2022:</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total special occupied place allocation</td>

      <td>The number of special occupied places multiplied by the rate per place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Special unoccupied place funding per day</td>
      <td>£100,000 ÷ 365 = £273.97</td>
      <td>The yearly special unoccupied place funding allocation divided by the number of days in the year (this gives a daily funding rate)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Special occupied place funding per day</td>
      <td>£30,000 ÷ 365 = £82.19</td>
      <td>The yearly special occupied place funding allocation divided by the number of days in the year (this gives a daily funding rate)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Prorated special unoccupied place funding</td>

      <td>This is the unoccupied funding per day amount multiplied by the number of days the school is open (1 October 2022 to the end of the 2022 to 2023 academic year, 31 August 2023)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Prorated special occupied place funding</td>

<h3>Estimating your start-up grant</h3>

<p>On opening, a start-up grant (<abbr title="start-up grant">SUG</abbr>) is paid to <strong>full-sponsored academies</strong> in order to assist them to raise standards and transform educational attainment. There are 2 elements to <abbr title="start-up grant">SUG</abbr>, part A and part B.</p>

<p>Part A is a flat rate allocation (based on the type of school), which an academy receives in the first year of opening. More information can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">here.</a></p>

<p>Part B is a formulaic allocation which is only paid to primary, secondary and all-through academies opening with numbers on roll (NOR) less than 90% of capacity; an academy will receive part B over a number of years as the academy grows.</p>

<p>The minimum value threshold is £10,000. The maximum values are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>primary – £50,000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>small secondary, capacity up to 250 pupils – £60,100</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>medium secondary, capacity 251 to 999 pupils – between £60,100 and £80,200</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large secondary, capacity of 1,000 or more pupils – £80,200</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">‘ready reckoner’</a> spreadsheet to estimate the <abbr title="start-up grant">SUG</abbr> B a secondary academy may expect to receive on opening sponsored academy funding, using the following instructions:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the sponsored academy funding: ready reckoner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter your school capacity in cell D13.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the number of pupils on roll (NOR) in cell D14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An indicative allocation will show in cell D26.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>: special and alternative provision academies</h2>

<p>Special and alternative academies receive high needs place funding. In the 2022 to 2023 academic year, we will use the 2021 to 2022 section 251 high needs and alternative provision maintained schools data sets to calculate your current high needs places.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This will be used to determine your funding allocation in draft GAGs and upon conversion. If this data is incorrect, please notify your local authority and advise the DfE project lead overseeing the conversion.</p>
</div>

<p>Special academies and post-16 provision are funded for pre-16 and post-16 provision on the same place funded basis, at £10,000 per special place and at £10,000 per alternative provision pre-16 place.</p>

<p>Further information on high needs funding arrangements in 2022 to 2023 is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">available</a>. Post-16 learners at alternative provision (<abbr title="&nbsp; alternative provision">AP</abbr>) academies will be funded according to the national 16 to 19 funding methodology. Element 3 top-up funding should continue to be provided by your local authority, at the rate agreed prior to conversion.</p>

<h3>Estimating your high needs place funding for special schools and <abbr title="&nbsp; alternative provision">AP</abbr> academies</h3>

<p>You can estimate your high needs funding by calculating a daily allocation and multiplying the number of remaining days in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>To illustrate, a special school with 40 high needs places that converted on 1 October 2022 would estimate their funding using the following method:</p>
