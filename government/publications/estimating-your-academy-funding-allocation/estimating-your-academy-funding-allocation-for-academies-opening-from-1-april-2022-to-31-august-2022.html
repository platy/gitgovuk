<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>Academies are funded in line with their funding agreements. Before a school opens as an academy, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) provides details of their revenue funding, known as the general annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>), in a draft allocation statement. This guide explains how to estimate your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> before receiving your draft statement. It includes links to online data and contains examples to help explain how to estimate your funding.</p>

<p>This guide is designed for schools converting to become academies and schools becoming sponsored academies between 1 April 2022 and 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>For free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (<abbr title="university technical colleges">UTCs</abbr>) we’ve published a financial template to allow you to calculate indicative allocations based on information about your school:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> General annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>): mainstream academies</h2>

<p><abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> is revenue funding and is used by academies to meet their day-to-day running costs. The main element of this funding is the pre-16 school budget share (<abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Funding outside of the <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>
</h3>

<p>As an academy, you will receive other revenue funding that is not part of your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. Currently confirmed are:</p>

  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you may also receive capital funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Risk protection arrangement</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-for-schools">risk protection arrangement (RPA)</a> is an alternative to commercial insurance for academies and local authority maintained schools. Under RPA, the UK government covers the losses instead of commercial insurance.</p>

<p>Schools converting to academy status will be signed up automatically to the RPA scheme, irrespective of whether they are a member of the local authority maintained school (LAMS) RPA scheme. However, if the school does not wish to join the RPA scheme, they should inform their Department for Education contact who will arrange this with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<p>After conversion, the RPA team, will provide those academies joining RPA, with details of their RPA membership certificate etc.</p>

<p>If you opt in, RPA will not be shown on your allocation statement as it does not affect your allocation, but it will affect the amount you will receive monthly. If you opt in, you will not receive an adjusted <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement, but your monthly pay schedule will be reissued.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Funding for new academies opening between 1 April 2022 and 31 August 2022</h2>

<p>The school budget share (<abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr>) for the 2021 to 2022 academic year will be the same as your predecessor school for the 2022 to 2023 financial year.</p>

<p>Funding is prorated until the end of the academic year, 31 August 2022. It does not include funding for insurance and early years funding that your local authority allocated to your maintained predecessor.</p>

<p>Sixth form funding is based on the 2021 to 2022 academic year rates.</p>

<p>High needs place funding is based on the 2021 to 2022 financial year rates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Estimating your pre-16 school budget share</h3>

<p>You can estimate your <abbr title="school budget share">SBS</abbr> by calculating a daily schools block allocation and multiplying it by the number of remaining days in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. To illustrate for a school that converts on 1 May 2022:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open your schools funding document supplied from your local authority.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the prorated allocation using the following method:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Estimating your sixth form funding</h3>

<p>You can estimate your sixth form funding by calculating a monthly allocation and multiplying the number of remaining months in the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>For example, for an academy that opens on 1 May 2022:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Funding data will be available from your 16 to 19 funding documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calculate the prorated allocation using the following method in the table below:</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form funding per month amount</td>
      <td>£500,000 divided by 12 equals £41,666.67</td>
      <td>This is the total funding allocation divided by the number of months in the year (12 months)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sixth form funding prorated amount</td>
      <td>£41,666.67 multiplied by 4 equals £166,666.68</td>
      <td>This is the sixth form funding amount multiplied by the number of months the school is open for (1 May 2022 to the end of the 2021 to 2022 academic year, 31 August 2022)</td>
    </tr>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Estimating your high needs places in mainstream schools</h3>

<p>Some mainstream schools receive high needs place funding. From April 2018, pre-16 places occupied by pupils recorded on the school census as sole or dual (main) are funded at £6,000. Pupils in these places will also attract funding through the mainstream school formula.</p>

<p>Other places are funded at £10,000 and are categorized as unoccupied. This may apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the place is or will be occupied by a pupil registered on the roll of another school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a place isn’t occupied at the time of the school census count, but is likely to be filled, and requires funding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>spare capacity is required for another reason</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://content.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/api/releases/D8574425-943C-41E5-B0C0-F45A1DC12792/files/234A21B6-722E-4800-8762-08D9924737DF" rel="external">2021 to 2022 section 251 high needs and alternative provision</a> (September to March) maintained schools data, sets out your current high needs places.  This will be used to determine your funding allocation in draft GAGs and upon conversion.  If this data is incorrect, or there is a requirement for post-16 high needs places, please notify your local authority and advise the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> project lead overseeing the conversion.</p>

<p>You can estimate your high needs place funding by calculating a daily allocation and multiplying the number of remaining days in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. To illustrate, for a mainstream school with 10 unoccupied places and 5 occupied places that converts on 1 May 2022:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4. </span> Estimating your start-up grant</h3>

<p>On opening, a start-up grant (<abbr title="start-up grant">SUG</abbr>) is paid to full-sponsored academies in order to assist them to raise standards and transform educational attainment. There are two elements to <abbr title="start-up grant">SUG</abbr>, part A and part B.</p>

<p>Part A is a flat rate allocation (based on the type of school), which an academy receives in the first year of opening.</p>

<p>Part B is a formulaic allocation which is only paid to academies opening with numbers on roll (NOR) less than 90% of capacity; an academy will receive part B over a number of years as the academy grows.</p>

<p>The minimum value threshold is £10,000. The maximum values are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>primary: £50,000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>small secondary, capacity up to 250 pupils: £60,100</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>medium secondary, capacity 251-999 pupils: between £60,100 and £80,200</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large secondary, capacity of 1,000 or more pupils: £80,200</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> General annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>): special and alternative provision academies</h2>

<p>Special and alternative provision academies receive high needs place funding. In the 2021 to 2022 academic year, we’ll use the figures published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://content.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/api/releases/D8574425-943C-41E5-B0C0-F45A1DC12792/files/234A21B6-722E-4800-8762-08D9924737DF" rel="external">2021 to 2022 section 251 high needs and alternative provision</a> spreadsheet to calculate this place funding.</p>

<p>Special academies and post-16 provision are funded for pre-16 and post-16 provision on the same place funded basis:  £10,000 per special place and £10,000 per alternative provision pre-16 place.</p>

<p>Post-16 learners at <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> academies will be funded according to the national 16-19 funding methodology.</p>

<p>Element 3 top-up funding should continue to be provided by your local authority at the rate agreed prior to conversion.</p>
