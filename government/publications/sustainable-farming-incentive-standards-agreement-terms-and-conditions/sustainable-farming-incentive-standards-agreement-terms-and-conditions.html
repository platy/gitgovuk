<h4>1.1. The Sustainable Farming Incentive</h4>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive (“<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>”) is a scheme run by the Rural Payments Agency (referred to below as “us”, “we, “our”) on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr>”). It is part of the Environmental Land Management Scheme under section 1 of the Agriculture Act 2020 and in conjunction with the Agriculture (Financial Assistance) <abbr title="The Agriculture (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2021, as amended.">Regulations</abbr> 2021 (“the <abbr title="The Agriculture (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2021, as amended.">Regulations</abbr>”).</p>
