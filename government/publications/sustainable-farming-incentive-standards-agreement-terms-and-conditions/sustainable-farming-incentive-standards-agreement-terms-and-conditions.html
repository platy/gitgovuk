<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> The Sustainable Farming Incentive</h3>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive (“<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>”) is a scheme run by the Rural Payments Agency (referred to below as “us”, “we, “our”) on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr>”). It is part of the Environmental Land Management Scheme under section 1 of the Agriculture Act 2020 and in conjunction with the Agriculture (Financial Assistance) <abbr title="The Agriculture (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2021, as amended.">Regulations</abbr> 2021 (“the <abbr title="The Agriculture (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2021, as amended.">Regulations</abbr>”).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> About these Terms and Conditions:</h3>

<p>(a) The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement (the “<abbr title="The SFI standards Agreement consisting of the Agreement Document, these Terms and Conditions, and the Standards you have chosen">Agreement</abbr>”) comprises:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the “<abbr title="The document accompanying these Terms and Conditions, which describes the Grant to be paid to you for delivering the chosen standard(s) to the level you have selected.">Agreement Document</abbr>”, which describes the sum to be paid to you (the “<abbr title="The sum to be paid to you for delivering the Standards, as described in the Agreement Document.">Grant</abbr>”) for delivering the chosen standard(s) to the level you have selected (the “<abbr title="The chosen standard(s) to be delivered to the level you have selected.">Standards</abbr>”)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) these “Terms and Conditions”, which are applicable to the payment of the <abbr title="The sum to be paid to you for delivering the Standards, as described in the Agreement Document.">Grant</abbr>; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the “<abbr title="The chosen standard(s) to be delivered to the level you have selected.">Standards</abbr>”</p>

<p>(b) If there is any conflict between these Terms and Conditions, the <abbr title="The document accompanying these Terms and Conditions, which describes the Grant to be paid to you for delivering the chosen standard(s) to the level you have selected.">Agreement Document</abbr> and the <abbr title="The chosen standard(s) to be delivered to the level you have selected.">Standards</abbr>, these Terms and Conditions will be given priority.</p>

<p>(c) When the agreement holder (“you”) enters the <abbr title="The SFI standards Agreement consisting of the Agreement Document, these Terms and Conditions, and the Standards you have chosen">Agreement</abbr>, you are agreeing to the terms applicable to the payment of the <abbr title="The sum to be paid to you for delivering the Standards, as described in the Agreement Document.">Grant</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Why you should read the Terms and Conditions</h3>

<p>You should read the Terms and Conditions carefully because they provide information including:</p>

<p>(b) how you or we may change or end the <abbr title="The SFI standards Agreement consisting of the Agreement Document, these Terms and Conditions, and the Standards you have chosen">Agreement</abbr>; and</p>

<p>(c) what you need to do if you cannot comply with your obligations under the <abbr title="The SFI standards Agreement consisting of the Agreement Document, these Terms and Conditions, and the Standards you have chosen">Agreement</abbr>.</p>
