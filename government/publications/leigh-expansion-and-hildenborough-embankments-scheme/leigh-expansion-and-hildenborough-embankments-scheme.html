<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Communities in Tonbridge and Hildenborough are at risk of flooding from the River Medway. Flooding occurred in these areas in 1960, 1963, 1968, 1974, 2001 and 2013/14.</p>

<p>There was significant flooding in Tonbridge and Hildenborough in 1968. The Leigh flood storage area (FSA) was built to reduce the risk of future flooding to approximately 1,200 homes and businesses.</p>

<p>There is a threat that climate change will increase the risk of flooding in the coming years. The Environment Agency is working on a scheme to increase the capacity of the Leigh FSA. This will help reduce the risk of flooding to more local homes and businesses.</p>

<h2>What’s happening?</h2>

<p>To reduce the risk of flooding for more homes in the area, the scheme will increase the storage capacity of the existing Leigh FSA. Works will also include the construction of an embankment in Hildenborough.</p>

<p>Currently the Environment Agency can legally store water to a maximum level of 28.05 metres above ordnance datum (AOD), as measured at the control structure.</p>

<p>Investigations have shown that storing water to 28.6 metres AOD will reduce flood risk to over 1,400 homes in Tonbridge and Hildenborough. Storing to this level will need 16.4 hectares of extra land but will increase the storage capacity by 24% to over 7 million cubic metres.</p>

<p>Increasing the maximum stored water level requires permission from the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. This approval is essential for both the Leigh expansion and Hildenborough parts of the scheme to proceed. The two parts of the scheme are linked, technically and financially and neither can proceed without the other.</p>

<h2>Investment and funding</h2>

<p>The scheme is estimated to cost £21.5 million. Funding has been secured from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>government</li>
  <li>Kent County Council</li>
  <li>Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council</li>
  <li>South East Local Enterprise Partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>Expanding the reservoir is a big job which will take time. While the expansion scheme is being developed, the Environment Agency will invest in a programme of engineering works. This will keep the existing FSA fully operational and compliant with the relevant legislation.</p>

<p>These works will also feed into the design of the enlargement scheme.</p>

<h2>Partnership</h2>

<p>The scheme is being delivered in partnership with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kent County Council</li>
  <li>Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council</li>
  <li>South East Local Enterprise Partnership.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update – March 2022</h2>

<h3>Leigh flood storage area expansion</h3>

<p>In September 2021, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs approved the Environment Agency’s application to increase the maximum allowable stored water level within the Leigh FSA from 28.05 metres AOD to 28.6 metres AOD. This decision is essential to enable the Leigh expansion and Hildenborough embankment scheme to proceed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/leigh-flood-storage-area-expansion-scheme">Find out more about this decision and the scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Hildenborough embankment</h3>

<p>We are confident that we have achieved the most efficient embankment design possible at Hildenborough. Technically, economically and environmentally.</p>

<p>In February 2022, the planning application for the Hildenborough embankment works was submitted to Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council. We know that people will want to see the details.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publicaccess2.tmbc.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=R8232GQHMT300&amp;activeTab=summary" rel="external">view and comment on the application online through the planning portal</a>.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>The Environment Agency expects to appoint contractors in spring 2022.</p>

<p>Preconstruction works are currently programmed to begin at the FSA in summer/spring 2022. The work at the Leigh control structure gates will begin in summer 2023.</p>

<p>We expect construction to begin at Hildenborough in 2024. The construction programme at Hildenborough depends on the planning decision. We will provide an update on the programme once we receive a planning decision.</p>

<p>The full scheme is due to be complete in autumn 2025. This is later than originally planned due to the time required for the public inquiry.</p>

<h3>Reservoirs Act work</h3>

<p>In January 2021 the Environment Agency received planning permission to proceed with essential works required to the FSA under the Reservoirs Act 1975.</p>

<p>These works involve lifting the top soil of the existing 1.5 kilometre main embankment and laying reinforcing materials. This reinforced layer will be covered with a layer of soil then sown with grass to further stabilise the surface. Once these works are complete, the embankments will look very similar to how they look now. These works will ensure the Leigh FSA continues to safely reduce flood risk to Tonbridge, Hildenborough and downstream communities into the future.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer we will be working on the Leigh FSA embankment between the A21 and the main control structure. To carry out the works safely we will need to temporarily close some of the footpaths in the area. We have worked with Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council and Kent County Council to consider where we can put in footpath diversions but, unfortunately, the options are limited. We understand the impact and inconvenience these closures will cause but everyone’s safety must take priority. We are working with Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council and Kent County Council to find alternative routes. The footpath closures will be clearly signposted.</p>

<p>You can view the closures on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kent.gov.uk/environment-waste-and-planning/public-rights-of-way/rights-of-way-map" rel="external">Public Rights of Way - Public Rights of Way Map</a>.</p>

<p>We would like to apologise for the inconvenience. We will re-open the footpaths as soon as we can.</p>

<p>The works to the embankment will be ongoing until autumn 2023 and will not affect the operation of the Leigh FSA to reduce the risk of flooding.

<h3>Medway catchment projects</h3>

<p>The Leigh expansion and Hildenborough embankment scheme is part of the Medway Flood Action Plan. The Action Plan was developed by the Medway Flood Partnership. Established in January 2017, this brings together local partners, national agencies, non government organisations and community representatives. The partnership focuses on reducing the risk of flooding from non tidal rivers and surface water in the Medway catchment.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/river-medway-partnership">River Medway Partnership</a> page, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-river-medway-partnership-objectives-members-and-action-plan">The Medway Flood Partnership: objectives, members and action plan</a>.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions about the Hildenborough embankment</h2>

<p>Q: Where does the flood risk in Hildenborough come from?</p>

<p>A: Most of the flood risk at Hildenborough is caused by the rising water levels in the River Medway flood plain which occur in times of high flow. Not by the Hawden Stream.</p>

<p>Q: What already exists to help reduce flood risk?</p>

<p>A: Hildenborough already benefits from the existing Leigh FSA. The FSA controls the peak flows coming down the River Medway, which would back up the Hawden Stream and cause flooding.</p>

<p>Figure 1 (below) shows the reduction in flood risk provided by the existing Leigh FSA in a very large flood event. The likelihood of a flood event this size occurring in any one year is 1%. The modelling includes an allowance for climate change.</p>

<p>The orange line shows the flood extent that would be experienced without the operation of Leigh FSA. The blue outline shows the extent with the Leigh FSA in operation at current storage levels.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="The reduction in flood risk provided by the existing Leigh FSA in a very large flood event" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146351/Mar_2022_update_-_fig_1-resized.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>Image shows a map with areas that might be still be flooded marked in blue, with an orange line indicating areas that would be protected by the new scheme</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Q: Why doesn’t the Leigh FSA prevent flooding entirely?</p>

<p>A: The capacity of the Leigh FSA is limited by the available land and local geography. In larger flood events there is not enough room to store all the damaging flows.</p>

<p>Q: What is proposed to further reduce flood risk in Hildenborough?</p>

<p>A: For the majority of flood events, the Leigh FSA will protect properties in Hildenborough as it does at the moment. We want to increase the maximum storage level within the FSA to provide more protection in very severe events, like that experienced in December 2013.</p>

<p>Even if we do this, in severe events the increased capacity in the Leigh FSA will not prevent all homes in Hildenborough from flooding. This is why an embankment is needed to stop the rising levels in the River Medway floodplain from flooding the low-lying land and homes in Hildenborough.</p>

<p>The proposed embankment will work in tandem with the Leigh FSA. It will cross the natural Hawden Stream valley to stop some of the peak flood water from the River Medway. A gate structure and pumping station will be within the embankment. The gate will allow the Hawden Stream to flow downstream into the River Medway through the embankment. Most of the time the gate will be open, and the Hawden Stream will flow towards the River Medway as it does at the moment.</p>

<p>If the flood event is very severe and the volume of water in the River Medway cannot be managed by the Leigh FSA alone, the gate structure will close. This will stop the rising levels in the River Medway backing up the Hawden Stream and affecting vulnerable houses in Hildenborough. Once the gate is closed the Hawden Stream will flow into the Hildenborough pumping station and be pumped over the embankment.</p>

<p>Q: Why does the embankment rely on the Leigh FSA expansion being in place?</p>

<p>A: The Hildenborough embankment will remove a small amount of natural floodplain. Using the Hildenborough embankment on its own could increase flood levels in Tonbridge. No increase is acceptable. We need the extra capacity gained by the Leigh expansion to be in place to offset this loss of floodplain.</p>

<p>Q: How can you be sure that the water excluded from the natural flood plain by the embankment and the pumping station will not raise the level of the flood downstream?</p>

<p>A: The area that the embankment will remove from the floodplain is relatively small. We will gain more than 1 million cubic metres of extra storage in the Leigh FSA. This will more than compensate for the loss of floodplain at Hildenborough.</p>

<p>Q: If the expanded Leigh FSA (but not the embankment) had been in place in December 2013, would the homes in Hildenborough have flooded?</p>

<p>A: Yes. It is most likely that they would have still flooded, but to a lesser extent and depth.</p>

<p>The flood risk in Hildenborough arises because the River Medway floodplain extends up the Hawden Stream. This puts low-lying properties at risk. The existing Leigh FSA already provides significant benefit to Hildenborough. The expansion will further improve this benefit. Yet, in larger flood events like 2013, many homes remain at significant risk from the River Medway. The proposed embankment will prevent flooding from the River Medway backing up the Hawden Stream and will protect the most vulnerable properties.</p>

<p>Q: Will the scheme only benefit some homes?</p>

<p>A: While some of the properties most at risk of flooding will gain the greatest benefit, all properties at risk will benefit from the proposed scheme. It is important to remember that the expansion of the Leigh FSA is part of this project. Properties downstream of the embankment already benefit from the existing Leigh FSA and will benefit further from its expansion.</p>

<p>Figure 2 (below) shows that the increase in FSA capacity will further increase protection for all properties in Hildenborough. It also shows the further benefit that the Hildenborough embankment will provide.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Image shows a map of the area with area of proposed expansion of flood scheme marked in blue, and embankment and wall of Leigh and Hildenborough flood scheme marked in red" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146392/Mar_2022_update_-_fig_2_-_resized_-_jpg.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Change in flood risk for 1% + climate change annual probability event</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>It is worth noting that the flood extents shown in Figures 1 and 2 are based on an extreme flood events, greater than any experienced to date. In less severe flood events, the extent of flooding will be less than that shown.</p>

<p>Q: Could the new embankment increase flood risk to my property?</p>

<p>A: Our extensive modelling shows that the proposed embankment will not increase flood risk to any households. We understand concerns that an embankment across the floodplain could create a ‘wet’ and a ‘dry’ side of the proposed defence. This will not be the case.</p>

<p>The embankment will control water levels in this part of the River Medway floodplain to prevent flooding of homes. During operation water levels will still rise on both sides of the embankment in Hildenborough. On the upstream side, the level will be kept below that which will cause flooding to low lying properties.</p>

<p>The purpose of the pumping station is to maintain the flow in the Hawden Stream towards the River Medway and not to pump water out of the floodplain.</p>

<p>Q: Will the embankment have a visual impact on the local area?</p>

<p>A: We have carried out numerous design revisions to minimise the visual, environmental and construction impact of the design at all stages. We have sought to reduce the height of the embankment, the pumping station, and the control kiosks to make these as unobtrusive as possible.</p>

<p>We are working with landscape architects and designers to minimise the visual impact from all directions. We recognise the concerns of all residents in the area, and we will continue to try to minimise and reduce any visual impact where we can. The works proposed by the Environment Agency will be subject to planning approval.</p>

<p>Q: How high is the pumping station?</p>

<p>A: The maximum overall depth of the pumping station structure will be approximately 4.5 metres. However, only approximately 1.6 metres of this will be above the existing ground level – the remainder will be below ground. The above ground section will be incorporated within the embankment construction, so the visual impact will be reduced. Safety handrailing approximately 1.1 metre high will be incorporated around the top of the pumping station structure.</p>

<p>Q: When the pumping station is operational, how loud will it be? And will it potentially run at night until the water is drained?</p>

<p>A: The pump manufacturer has provided the following information regarding sound values: ‘Typical for the SAF70 (the pump we plan to use) in a canister would be 76 dB(a).’</p>

<p>This value would be at a distance of 1 metre from the pump as standard.</p>

<p>This value would be decreased by a number of additional factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the water surrounding the pump</li>
  <li>the pump is within a concrete sump, which is itself below ground level</li>
  <li>the distance to the nearest residential properties approximately 50 metres away</li>
</ul>

<p>During a flood event, the pumps would continue to run at night as necessary but are only predicted to run on very rare occasions.</p>

<p>We will test the pumps each month. This will ensure they are in good working order when they are needed. We will fit a timer to the pumps and run them once a month for 30 seconds at a time at a low speed. No water will be discharged from the pipes. The penstock will also be tested once every month to confirm it operates, with a full open and close test every 6 months.</p>

<p>Q: What has been done to minimise the sound impact when the pumping station is in operation?</p>

<p>A: The design uses electric submersible pumps. This means that the pump motors are submerged in water within the concrete pump chamber during operation (the water actually flows around the motors, helping to cool them as well as deadening the sound).</p>

<p>The motors are also variable speed drives, so will ramp up slowly and only run at the speed needed to cope with the water present at any given time. As they are fish and eel friendly axial flow pumps, they are operated at lower speeds than other pump types to reduce potential for harm.</p>

<p>Q: Will the Hildenborough Embankment itself become a large raised reservoir when complete?</p>

<p>A: We have been working with the Reservoir Panel Engineer to ensure that the embankment is physically unable to impound sufficient water on the upstream side for it to become formally classified as a reservoir, even unintentionally. To facilitate this, we will incorporate an overflow pipe with a non-return valve into the top of the penstock structure.</p>

<p>This will mean that, at its highest level, the Hawden Stream will be able to discharge through the structure as downstream levels start to recede. The level of the overflow pipe will limit the maximum volume of water impounded on the Hildenborough side to approximately 10,000 cubic metres.  As the downstream levels lower, the penstock will then open, allowing the Hildenborough levels to drop and balance out.</p>

<p>Q: How will you manage the impact of construction works?</p>

<p>A: We appreciate that construction work can be very disruptive to the local community. Health, safety and environmental impacts are key considerations in our work, and we are keen to work with everyone who will be affected so that we can find ways to minimise the disruption.</p>

<p>We have worked closely with our contractor, VolkerStevin, to see how we can mitigate any impacts. These have been included in the traffic management plan which has been submitted with the planning application. This plan will minimise the impact and disruption of construction. If any damage is caused as result of vehicle movements or any construction activities, we will make sure that it is repaired</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publicaccess2.tmbc.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=R8232GQHMT300&amp;activeTab=summary" rel="external">view and comment on the application online through the planning portal</a>.</p>

<p>Q: How long will the construction and use of Stacey Road, Hilden Park Road and Hawden Lane be for?</p>

<p>A: We are still in the early days of planning the construction programme, so it is subject to change. The initial programme from our suppliers currently indicates a construction period of 20 months. It should be noted that this includes mobilisation and demobilisation periods which run for around 30 to 50 days either side of the main works, and these are naturally quieter periods.</p>

<p>The traffic management plan estimates an average of 12 vehicles per day for the Hildenborough works. These vehicles will visit site via Stacey Road and Hawden Lane. Hilden Park Road is not currently envisaged to be used.</p>

<p>It is our intention to space deliveries out to avoid peak times where possible. Deliveries will be within normal working hours and aim to avoid the school runs. We will do our best to reduce the size of vehicles where possible, for example, by using offsite storage. Further details are included within the planning application which is available on Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council’s planning portal.</p>

<p>We will continue to refine the programme throughout 2022 and will do our best to optimise and reduce the construction period.</p>

<p>Q: Will the Hawden lane widening that has been proposed be carried out for the safety of the public and users of Hawden Lane?</p>

<p>A: The safety of the public is paramount and a site management plan, including details on traffic management, is being developed in consultation with the landowners to ensure that suitable measures are in place. In consultation with our main construction contractor, who has a wealth of experience in works such as these, it has been decided that widening works to Hawden Lane are not required.</p>
