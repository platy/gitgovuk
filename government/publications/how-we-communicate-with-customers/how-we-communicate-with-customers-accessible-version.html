      <li>specific application queries</li>
    </ul>

  <li>continue to answer any general queries on Twitter about our services</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we communicate with customers</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff how we communicate with our customers using GOV.UK, HM Passport Office web chat, Skype for business, social media and advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>We interact with customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through examiners, customer service teams and an external call centre run by Teleperfomance.</p>

<p>We communicate with customers to ask for more information, to follow up requests for information and keep them updated. To do this, we use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automated emails and SMS (short message service)
    <ul>
      <li>when a customer applies online, we ask if they want to get notifications by email, SMS or both</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>telephone calls</li>
  <li>letters (by post and email)</li>
  <li>Skype for business</li>
  <li>webchat</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a></li>
  <li>social media</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/867556/6.4824_HMPO_Applying_for_your_Passport_Guidance_ILB_52__11.19_.pdf" rel="external">application guidance booklet</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not get a reply to an email or letter we have sent to a customer who has a live application with us, we will follow the withdrawn application guidance.</p>

<p>If we do not get a reply to an email or letter we send to a countersignatory, we will follow countersignatories guidance.</p>

<h3>If a customer is abusive with our staff</h3>

<p>HM Passport Office staff are not expected to deal with abusive, violent or threatening customers, either face to face, by phone or in correspondence.</p>

<p>If you, the member of staff, have an abusive customer, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the right to refuse to serve them</li>
  <li>must refer to customer conduct guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we communicate using GOV.UK</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> provides public information for UK government services, including HM Passport Office. It includes announcements, publications, statistics and consultations and provides our customers with useful information, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>locations of passport interview offices</li>
  <li>locations of Application Processing Centers</li>
  <li>contact details for our Advice line</li>
  <li>how to make an appointment</li>
  <li>how to apply for a passport</li>
  <li>how to cancel a lost or stolen passport</li>
  <li>how to apply for an emergency travel document</li>
  <li>the standards customers must meet to get a passport (for example, photo standards)</li>
  <li>passport fees</li>
  <li>how to contact us</li>
  <li>how to make a complaint</li>
  <li>our policies and guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we communicate using HM Passport Office’s web chat</h3>

<p>The web chat service is provided by Teleperformance (TP) and is an additional communication channel for our customers. It is available from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday and 9am to 6pm Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>TP will send an email to the Customer Service Management team (CSMT) with any questions they need them to answer. A CSMT agent will contact the customer within 24 hours.</p>

<p>A customer can print a transcript of the web chat.</p>

<h3>How we communicate using Skype for business</h3>

<p>We use Skype for business to facilitate remote passport interviews in specific circumstances where we are unable to carry out a face to face interview as specified in guidance.</p>

<h4>Interviewing a person resident abroad by Skype for business</h4>

<p>When we need to interview a person who is resident abroad this will be facilitated using Skype only when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is not possible for a face to face interview in their country or a neighbouring one</li>
  <li>there is no Visa Access Centre (VACS) in the country</li>
  <li>there is no agreement to use the VACS</li>
  <li>the VACS cannot be used for example because of social distancing policies</li>
</ul>

<h4>Interviewing a person resident in the UK by Skype for business</h4>

<p>If we need to interview a person who is resident in the UK this will be facilitated using Skype when exceptional measures are in place.</p>

<p>To conduct an identity interview using Skype, you, must follow the Identity interviews using Skype guidance.</p>

<h3>How we communicate using Social Media</h3>

<p>We interact with customers on Twitter and respond to generic questions and service issues. We do not engage with customers using other forms of social media, such as: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or YouTube.</p>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office do have Facebook accounts overseas in some countries so may also provide some generic responses to questions or issues raised.</p>

<h4>How we respond on Twitter</h4>

<p>We get questions and complaints on Twitter using our handle: @HM_Passport. A dedicated team in the Customer Services Management team (CSMT) deal with any Twitter messages.</p>

<p>CSMT will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answer any general queries on Twitter about our services</li>
  <li>no respond on Twitter to any:
    <ul>
      <li>Direct Message from customers</li>
      <li>specific application queries</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our customer messaging will tell customers to contact the passport advice line for further help.</p>

<h3>How we handle advertising campaigns</h3>

<p>Advertising campaigns can include social media, radio, TV, digital signage and search engine ads.</p>

<p>For paid advertising campaigns, the Campaign and Behavioural Marketing team submits a brief to the Home Office Strategic Communications team, who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop a campaign plan</li>
  <li>work with the Cabinet Office and other departments to sign off the campaign</li>
  <li>engage with media agencies to deliver the campaign</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we communicate with a customer with disabilities</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff about the services we offer to help us communicate with customers who are profoundly deaf, have a hearing loss or have a speech impairment and customers who are blind or partially sighted.</p>

<p>HM Passport Office provides a range of services to support customers who are profoundly deaf, have a hearing loss or have a speech impairment and customers who are blind or partially sighted.</p>

<h3>Customers who are deaf, have a hearing loss or speech impairment</h3>

<p>To support customers who are profoundly deaf, hearing-impaired or have a speech impairment, Teleperformance (TP) uses text relay on a Minicom phone. The customer sends a message and TP replies. This service has the same opening hours as the normal Advice line.<br>
The Customer Service Management team (CSMT) uses the Next Generation Text Relay Service (NGTR) to provide a text relay service for customers.</p>

<p>NGTR lets customers with hearing or speech impairments communicate through telephone or text-phone equipment and other devices (for example, personal computers and tablets). An assistant will relay the speech between the 2 people on the call.</p>

<p>When you, the CSMT officer, receive a call from NGTR:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A recorded message will say, ‘Please hold for an operator-assisted call from a text-phone user.’</li>
  <li>A relay assistant will be connected to the call.</li>
  <li>The relay assistant will say, ‘Hello, you have a call from a deaf or speech-impaired person, and I will be relaying the call. Please say ‘go ahead’ when you have finished speaking.’</li>
</ol>

<h4>Sign language and induction loops in Customer Service Centre</h4>

<p>At our Customer Service Centres (CSC) and interview offices, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>volunteer staff trained in sign language that can help interpret</li>
  <li>induction loops and quiet rooms with no background noise</li>
  <li>British Sign Language interpreters to help with passport interviews</li>
</ul>

<h4>When to book a British Sign Language interpreter</h4>

<p>Customers who need a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter to translate at an interview, must</p>

<ol>
  <li>Call the Interview Hub to book an interview.</li>
  <li>Book the interpreter when they book their interview appointment.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Interview Hub must ask the TP Authentication by Interview (ABI) service desk to book an interpreter.</p>

<p>Customers who visit a CSC can bring a friend to sign for them, but we do not allow the friend to take part in a passport identity interview.</p>

<h3>Customers who are blind or partially sighted</h3>

<p>We support customers who are blind or partially sighted with versions of the guidance booklet available, in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>braille</li>
  <li>audio tape</li>
  <li>large print format</li>
</ul>

<p>Customers can ask for a guidance booklet by contacting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">Passport Adviceline</a>.</p>

<h4>Braille stickers for passports</h4>

<p>We can attach a braille sticker to a new passport.</p>

<p>Customers must ask for the Braille sticker option when they apply. To get a sticker for a current passport, the customer must call the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line">Passport Adviceline</a>.</p>

<h3>Customers who need help filling in their application form</h3>

<p>Customers can&nbsp;call the Passport Adviceline if they are blind or partially sighted and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-services-disabled">need help with their passport application form.</a></p>

<p>A member of the CSMT, will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fill in the form for the customer, using the information they provide</li>
  <li>post the form to the customer, to:
    <ul>
      <li>check</li>
      <li>sign</li>
      <li>return with the correct documents, payment and photos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Customer communication: automated texts and emails</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff about how and when we send automated emails and SMS (short message service) text messages to customers.</p>

<p>We send email and SMS (short message service) text messages to customers using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">GOV.UK Notify</a>.</p>

<h3>When we send automated texts and emails</h3>

<p>We send automated texts and emails at different times in the customer’s passport journey.</p>

<h4>Automated reminders: when a passport is due to expire</h4>

<p>We send automated SMS text messages to a customer’s mobile phone to remind them their passport (or their child’s passport) is due to expire.</p>

<h4>Automated reminders: Premium and Fast Track appointments</h4>

<p>We send automated SMS text messages to customers to remind them they have booked a counter appointment. We only do this if they have asked us during the application process. Customers can also ask for reminders by email.</p>

<h4>Automated reminders: asking for documents</h4>

<p>When customers do not send us the documents we need, we will send them automatic reminders through text message or email. If a customer still does not send us their documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the examiner must withdraw the AMS (Application Management System) after 90 days</li>
  <li>DAP (Digital Application Processing) will automatically withdraw the application after 97 days</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated responses: from examination team mailbox</h4>

<p>If a customer sends an email to an examination team mailbox, we will send them an automatic email response to acknowledge receipt of the email.</p>

<p>The team operational team leader (OTL) must make sure the automatic response has been added to the mailbox using the standard template. Once the response has been set, the examiner will not need to recheck it when they sent an email from the mailbox.</p>

<h4>Automated messages: when the customer’s passport is expected</h4>

<p>We send automated SMS text messages and emails to customers to tell them when they can expect to receive their new passport. The message will be in English or Welsh (if the customer has applied in Welsh).</p>

<h4>Automated messages: digital referee notifications</h4>

<p>We will tell customers, when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we send an email to their digital referee asking them to complete the referee section of the application</li>
  <li>the referee has completed the application</li>
  <li>we have finished automatic identity checks</li>
  <li>we reject their referee and need a new one</li>
</ul>

<p>See: how to deal with customers who cannot provide a digital referee</p>

<h4>Automated messages: specific requests</h4>

<p>We will also send the customer an automated message (if they have supplied a mobile number), when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we need a new photo</li>
  <li>Sopra Steria Ltd asks for documents to support an application</li>
  <li>the customer has applied from the UK and we ask them for a new countersignature</li>
  <li>it’s time to send in their documents (for example, after the digital referee completes their section)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated messages: after we issue a passport</h4>

<p>We will send the customer an automated message:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to tell them we have approved their application</li>
  <li>when we issue their new passport using the Premium service</li>
  <li>telling them their passport will be with them soon (when we issue their new passport using the standard or Fast Track service)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated messages: reminders to sign new passports</h4>

<p>We will send customers an automatic message reminding them to sign their new passport when they receive it.</p>

<h3>When we stop sending automatic messages</h3>

<p>We will stop sending automatic messages when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we have sent the customer their new passport</li>
  <li>we replace an online application with a paper application form</li>
</ul>

<h3>Messages sent from the Digital Lost Stolen Reporting system</h3>

<p>If a customer reports a passport lost or stolen using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-a-lost-or-stolen-passport">Digital Lost Stolen Reporting (DLSR) system</a>, they will receive automatic notifications at different stages of the process.</p>

<p>For UK cases, a customer can choose to get notifications by SMS (short message service) email or both. For overseas cases, we will send notifications by email.</p>

<p>DLSR will send automatic notifications, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>let the customer know we have received the lost or stolen report</li>
  <li>tell the customer we have cancelled their passport</li>
  <li>give the customer a reference number for the lost and stolen record</li>
</ul>

<p>If we need more information, Teleperformance (TP) will try to contact the customer 3 times. If TP contacts the customer, they will continue to deal with the report.</p>

<p>If TP is unable to contact the customer, they must select a radio button to move the report to the next stage. This will trigger an automatic notification to the customer. DLSR will send these messages, after the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first unsuccessful attempt to contact the customer</li>
  <li>second unsuccessful attempt to contact the customer</li>
  <li>third unsuccessful attempt to contact the customer</li>
</ul>

<p>TP will cancel the report after the third unsuccessful attempt to phone the customer.</p>

<p>For further information on how TP support our customers please see How Teleperformance communicates with customers.</p>

<h2>How to contact customers by phone</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff when and how we make phone calls to customers, the greetings we must use and how we identify the customer.</p>

<p>We phone customers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask for information missing from their application</li>
  <li>answer questions they have</li>
</ul>

<p>Calling a customer may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide information unless we require further documents or written consent</li>
  <li>prevent delay to their application</li>
</ul>

<p>See individual guidance topics for details of what information can be taken over the phone. In some cases, written confirmation will always be needed.</p>

<p>Staff may phone a countersignatory or digital referee to ask for information they have not given on the application form or to clarify responses received.</p>

<h3>When to phone a customer: office hours</h3>

<p>You, the examiner, must only phone a customer between the hours of 9am and 8pm. Calling a customer outside these hours can cause alarm and distress.</p>

<p>Before calling a customer overseas, you must check the time difference. If the time in that country is not between 9am and 8pm, you must send an email.</p>

<p>You can phone outside these hours, if the customer says they are happy for you to call them.</p>

<p>Before contacting a customer, you must check the application and case notes to see if the customer has told us about any times when they will not be available.</p>

<p>If you contact a customer by telephone and they do not answer the initial call, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make 2 further attempts to call the customer in one day (making no more than 3 calls in one 24 hour period)</li>

<h3>How to answer, open and close a phone call</h3>

<p>To maintain good customer service and give a professional approach to phone calls, all staff must consistent in their telephone manner.</p>

<h4>How to answer a phone call</h4>

<p>You must answer a phone call with the greeting: “Good [morning, afternoon evening], Her Majesty’s Passport Office [office location], [first name] speaking. How can I help you?”</p>

<h4>How to open a phone call</h4>

<p>When calling a customer, you must open the call with: “Good [morning, afternoon, evening], I am calling from Her Majesty’s Passport Office [office location], my name is [first name]. Can I speak to [customer’s name (first name and surname)]? Is this a convenient time to talk?”</p>

<h4>How to close a phone call</h4>

<p>When closing a phone call, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Thank the customer for their call or the information they have given us.</li>
  <li>Ask them if there is anything else you can help with.</li>
  <li>Say goodbye.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Identifying the customer on the phone</h3>

<p>Before answering a customer’s questions, you must first confirm their identity on the phone by asking security questions.</p>

<p>If you cannot identify a customer, you must not tell them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an application exists</li>
  <li>any information about the application, including details</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we can say over the phone</h3>

<p>The Disclosure guidance explains what information you can discuss over the phone.</p>

<h3>If a customer tells us they are recording the phone call</h3>

<p>HM Passport Office does not consent for customers to share, publish or broadcast a conversation with HM Passport Office in any way.</p>

<p>If a customer says they are recording the conversation, you must ask what they intend to do with the recording. If they say they are going to share, publish or broadcast the conversation, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell them HM Passport Office does not consent to this sharing of information</li>
  <li>politely end the call</li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer says they are keeping the recording for their own records, you can continue the call. You must advise the customer that under General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) they must not share, publish or broadcast the conversation.</p>

<h2>How to use Application Management System letters</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff about the different types of letters we use during the passport application process when we use the Application Management System (AMS).</p>

<p>HM Passport Office and our partners Sopra Steria Ltd send letters created on the Application Management System to customers to ask them for a range of information and documents to complete their passport application. For example, we may ask for birth certificates, fees, photos, parental consent or court orders.</p>

<h3>Letters Sopra Steria Ltd send</h3>

<p>When Sopra Steria Limited (SSL) scans a paper application or declaration form on to the Application Management (AMS), AMS automatically identifies, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documents are missing</li>
  <li>required information is missing</li>
  <li>the fee is incorrect</li>
  <li>the fee is missing</li>
  <li>the Post Office Check and Send service has sent the application</li>
</ul>

<p>For applications sent through the post, AMS will automatically generate a letter. SSL will normally post to the customer. In some overseas cases SSL may send a letter manually. SSL does not send letters on applications sent through the Post Office Check and Send service.</p>

<h3>Application Management System letter templates</h3>

<p>The Application Management System (AMS) has a collection of standard letters and phrases examiners regularly use when they need to contact a customer to ask for more documents and information.</p>

<p>Unless the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Titles">customer’s title is one we cannot use</a> or the International submissions route and Local Services booklet tells you about specific overseas delivery requirements you (the AMS examiner), must send post, using a customer’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>forename initials</li>
  <li>surname</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: Mr A.J. Johnson-Smith.</p>

<p>The Digital Application Processing system (DAP) removes all titles automatically and all correspondence to customers will show the customer’s first name and surname only.</p>

<h4>When a customer’s name is too long</h4>

<p>If a customer’s name is too long to fit on the item of post, you must use ‘the alternative address’ tab on the Application Management System (AMS) to amend their name.</p>

<h4>When a customer applies for a post-dated passport</h4>

<p>Because we send post-dated passports in the customer’s future name, you must write to them or send their supporting documents or new passport using their current name.</p>

<p>You must update the AMS letter template to change the name (and title) to show the customer’s current name and title.</p>

<h4>What title to use when sending a letter</h4>

<p>If you need to send a letter to a customer, you must check the ‘titles’ field and where a customer has selected a title preference you can accept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mr, Mrs, Miss and Ms</li>
  <li>professional titles (for example, doctor, judge, religious titles</li>
  <li>titles of nobility if you have confirmed it (see: Titles guidance)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Titles we cannot use when sending a letter or returning documents</h3>

<p>If a customer has included another title in the ‘other title’ field, you must remove the title (if the application is processed on AMS) and leave the field blank, using only the customer’s first name and surname. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>variations of Mr (for example, ‘Mister’)</li>
  <li>unconfirmed titles, that are not part of the actual name (for example, ‘His Majesty’, if not confirmed as an acceptable title of nobility)</li>
  <li>non-binary titles, such as Misc or Mx</li>
</ul>

<p>Some customers identify as non-binary and use a non-binary gender title, such as Mx in place of Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms.</p>

<p>You must make sure all correspondence addressed to customers who use non-binary gender titles only shows their first name and surname.</p>

<p>For example, you must address a letter as Dear Joe Bloggs (and not Dear Mx Bloggs).</p>

<p>You must remove any non-binary title and leave the title field blank in AMS if the customer has used a non-binary gender title. You must update the alternative address field in AMS to remove the customer’s title before you complete the application and return their new passport and supporting documents.</p>

<h4>Formatting customers names in letters</h4>

<p>When drafting a letter, you must format the name consistently throughout the letter. You must use lower case for all forenames and surnames with only the first letter of each name capitalised. You must not type the customer’s surname in capitals.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>‘Thank you for submitting a passport application for «Katie McNally»’</p>

<p>‘you sent us the version of «Katie»’s birth certificate which doesn’t…’</p>

<h4>How to compose an AMS system letter</h4>

<p>If you are examining an application and need to send a letter to a customer (or third party) using the AMS, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the examination of the application as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Resolve any questions with the countersignatory or (digital referee) before sending them a letter.</li>
  <li>Ask for all the documents and information you need in 1 letter.</li>
  <li>Select Generate Letter from the ‘Next Actions’ section (a ‘New IPS Letter’ screen will appear). If other letters have already been sent, the number of letters will show in brackets after the Letter History in the ‘Links’ menu.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How to address an AMS letter</h4>

<p>If you are sending a letter to the customer, you must check the address details on the paper application form match the one on the App Details screen.</p>

<p>You must make sure the customer’s address is correct and set out in a way that is acceptable for our couriers to deliver.</p>

<p>If the address details cannot be presented in full or do not match the address written by the customer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the details</li>

  <li>Click the Countersignatory radio button
    <ul>
      <li>this will automatically check the pre-paid label field</li>

      <li>the system will automatically print the letter with a blank address label</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3>How to use AMS free text letter phrases</h3>

<p>If you write a letter using the Application Management System (AMS) and there are no correct paragraphs that fit your needs, you can insert a blank (free text) paragraph. This free text area will allow you to customise the letter.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only use free text when absolutely necessary</li>
  <li>never use free text as an opening paragraph in a letter</li>
</ul>

<p>Before using free text, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check there is no other suitable phrase you can use</li>
  <li>search the letters and phrases log for an existing phrase you can use to ask for missing information or documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>When using a free text paragraph, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep the tone of the letter professional but friendly</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/files/howto.pdf" rel="external">use plain English</a> and words the customer can understand</li>
  <li>check for spelling and grammar errors</li>

</ul>

<h4>How to ask for a new digital photo on AMS</h4>

  <li>Create a text 917 letter on AMS (Application Management System) asking for a new photo that meets the standards.</li>
  <li>Include phrase 917 (AB)</li>
  <li>Include at least 1 reason the customer’s photo failed to meet the standards and a ‘next action’ paragraph.</li>
  <li>Add a case note explaining why you rejected the photo.</li>
  <li>Set an AMS ‘bring-up’ for 14 days.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will not need to print out a paper copy of the letter, as we will not post it to the customer. They will receive an automatic notification from the Digital Customer Service (DCS) system, asking them to follow a secure link. The link will let the customer view the letter online and direct them to the photo guidance notes.</p>

<p>The customer’s notification will also include a link that lets them upload a new digital photo. After the customer uploads their photo, the online photo tool will check and crop their image. The customer will be given guidance during this step, to help them capture an acceptable digital photo.</p>

<p>After the customer submits their photo online, AMS will create an alert with a bring-up for that day, telling you (the examiner) that the customer has uploaded a new photo.</p>

<p>You, the examiner, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review the photo</li>
  <li>if it is acceptable, you must case note the application.</li>
  <li>repeat the process, if you decide not to accept the replacement photo</li>

<h3>AMS: when we can and cannot accept emails</h3>

<p>Where we do accept emailed information from a customer (or countersignatory) we must already have their email address on the application. We cannot accept information from an email address not shown on the application.</p>

<p>We do not accept most documents or information we need for a passport application by email. As we need to check these documents are genuine, the customer must send them by post. For example, we do not accept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>core nationality documents (such as birth or marriage certificates, naturalisation or registration certificates)</li>
  <li>court orders (unless from a trusted source)</li>
  <li>identity documents (such as change of name documents)</li>

<ol>
  <li>Select the customer’s contact and delivery on the Application details tab.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>does the new email match the digital referee or countersignatory’s email (see Confirming ID: countersignatory and digital referees)</li>

      <li>your decision and the actions you take</li>
      <li>the new email address</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>there is evidence of fraud (see risk indicators)</li>
  <li>the customer may be vulnerable (see vulnerability considerations for passports) and the change of email address has not been authorised by someone who is acting on their behalf</li>
</ul>

<h4>How DCS customers track their application after a change</h4>

<p>Digital Customer Services (DCS) will not update the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/track/" rel="external">tracker page</a> with the customer’s new email address. The customer will:</p>

<p>If it is a simple question, you must try to resolve it on the phone. If you cannot resolve it by phone, you must contact the customer by email. There are 2 ways to create a customer email, depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the task you are processing</li>
  <li>whether the email template you need to use is included in:
    <ul>
      <li>o the ‘Comms builder’</li>
      <li>o a separate letter template</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sending an email in DAP: Comms builder templates</h3>

<p>To create an email using a Comms builder template, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the Send an email tab (the Send an email page will display).</li>

  <li>Change the email, if necessary, by clicking Continue editing and making the changes, (for example, if you have forgotten to include the subject field, or have selected the incorrect template or message options).</li>
  <li>Click Preview again to check the message is correct.</li>
  <li>Click Send.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<h3>DAP: Tell someone something – I’m not expecting a response</h3>

<p>You must use the Tell someone something – I’m not expecting a response radio button if you need to tell a customer information after completing their application. For example, when we:</p>

  <li>withdraw their passport because the customer is not entitled</li>
  <li>withdraw their application at the customer’s request</li>
  <li>send a travel document to the Home Office</li>
  <li>have processed a lost and stolen application</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have written the email, it will be saved. The email will not be sent to the customer until the application is completed (for example, the new passport issued, or the application withdrawn).</p>

<p>DAP does not yet have the functionality to process some of these application types. You must only use the letter templates if other guidance tells you to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the email is no longer needed</li>
  <li>a more suitable email can be used</li>
</ul>

</ol>

<h3>DAP: dealing with the customer’s reply</h3>

<p>DAP will create an alert called Documents received. This is in the Tasks tab with any outstanding tasks. You must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Tasks tab.</li>
  <li>Click View document, check the document the customer has sent, and complete the actions on the original task.</li>
  <li>Select I’ve checked the documents.</li>
  <li>Click Save.</li>
</ol>
