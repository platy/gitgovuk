<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1. This guide explains how, if you are interested in the outcome of an appeal, you can make your views known.</p>

<p>1.2. Please note – there are separate guides for enforcement appeals and lawful development certificate appeals that are proceeding by the hearing or inquiry process. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">access all our guides through GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>1.3. If you need this guidance in large print, in audio format or in Braille, please contact our Customer Support Team on 0303 444 5000.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who decides an appeal and what are the rules?</h2>

<p>2.1. Nearly all appeals are decided by our Inspectors, a very small percentage are decided by the Secretary of State - these tend to be the very large or contentious breaches of planning control.</p>

<p>2.2. For:</p>

<p>(a) an appeal against an enforcement notice (section 174 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990);
(b) an appeal against the refusal or non-determination of an application for a certificate of lawful use or development (section 195 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990);
(c) an appeal against a listed building enforcement notice (section 39 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990;</p>

<p>the appeal is decided under:</p>

<p>The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2002 - Statutory Instrument 2002/2683.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How you find out about the appeal</h2>

<p>3.1. If there is an appeal the local planning authority (LPA), usually your local council or National Park Authority, should write to everyone who it thinks is affected, to tell them about the appeal.</p>

<p>3.2. This is the minimum publicity requirement. Your LPA may give appeals more publicity and will probably put information on its website.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>The written procedure</h2>

<p>4.1. With this method of appeal, the Inspector considers written evidence from the appellant, the LPA and anyone else who, like you, has an interest in the appeal. The site is also likely to be visited.</p>

<p>4.2. The Business and Planning Act 2020 provides greater flexibility, allowing appeal procedures (the written procedure, hearing or inquiry) to be combined. Appeals proceeding by the written representations route will not normally be combined with other procedures and will follow the written representations procedure in most cases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What you can do</h2>

<p>5.1. If you have already contacted the LPA about the site or building it may send us your representations but it does not have to do this. If you want the Inspector to take your views into account you should send us your representations about the appeal.</p>

<p>5.2. You <strong>must</strong> make sure that we receive your representations within 6 weeks of the starting date for the appeal. The LPA should have told you the deadline. There is a timetable for the written representations procedure in the annexe to this guide.</p>

<p>5.3. The time limit given in the regulations for sending representations to us is important, and everyone taking part in an appeal must follow it. <strong>If you send us representations after the end of the time limits, we will not normally accept them. Instead we will return them to you. This means that the Inspector will not see them and so will not be able to take them into account.</strong></p>

<p>5.4. When you send us your representations you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address;</li>
  <li>the Planning Inspectorate appeal reference number (this will start APP/…);</li>
  <li>the address of the appeal site;</li>
</ul>

<p>and, for an appeal against an enforcement notice, say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I support the LPA in issuing the enforcement notice’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appellant in appealing against the enforcement notice’ and explain why;</li>
</ul>

<p>and, for an appeal about an application for a lawful development certificate, say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I support the LPA in refusing the application’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appellant in appealing against the LPA’s refusal’ and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.5. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">make your representation online through GOV.UK using the search facility</a> or you can write to or email us. The LPA should have told you our Case Officer’s contact details. Our Case Officer is responsible for the administration of the appeal.</p>

<p>5.6. If you send us your representations in a letter, unless your handwriting is very clear it would help if you are able to have your representations typed. Please use <strong>black</strong> ink. Please note that we do not acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>5.7. We will copy your representations to the appellant and to the LPA, where they will be available for anyone to see them.</p>

<p>5.8. However if we consider that your representations contain inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, we will send them back to you before the Inspector or anyone else sees them. If you take out the inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, you can send your representations back to us; <strong>but</strong> you must send them back before the time limit ends.</p>

<p>5.9. We do not accept anonymous representations, but you may ask for your name and address to be withheld. If you ask us to do this you should make sure that your representations do not include any other information which may identify you. We will copy your representations, with your name and address removed, to the parties, and they will be seen by the Inspector who may give them less weight as a result.</p>

<p>5.10. If you indicate that you do not want us to copy your representations to the appellant and the LPA, we will return them. They will not be seen by the Inspector and, therefore, will not be taken into account. This is because the Inspector can only take into account representations which have been copied to the appellant and the LPA and are available to be seen.</p>

<p>5.11. If you own the land and you do not appeal against <strong>an enforcement notice</strong> but someone else does appeal against it, in law you will have the status of an ‘interested person’. This does not entitle you to receive a copy of all the representations made by the appellant and other interested people (though you would be able to see such representations at the LPA’s offices).</p>

<p>5.12. However, in those circumstances, you may wish to request to be considered as an ‘interested owner’. This status is given at our discretion. It means that we will give you similar treatment as to an appellant. You will be able to attend any hearing or local inquiry, or be present when the Inspector visits the site. You will also be able to see and comment on any written representations made by the appellant, the LPA, and any other interested people, during the progress of the appeal. It is important you notify us to request this at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>What is considered?</h2>

<p>6.1. The Inspector can only take into account information and evidence that is relevant to the appeal. This could cover a wide range of issues, but those that apply are usually set out in the LPA’s reasons for issuing the enforcement notice or in the decision notice in the case of a lawful development certificate appeal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>If you decide to send documents to support your representations</h2>

<p>7.1. Please note that we are unable to return any documents or photographs.</p>

<p>7.2. Please</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a font such as Arial or Verdana in a size of 11 point or larger;</li>
  <li>use <strong>A4</strong> paper wherever possible;</li>
  <li>number the pages of the documents;</li>
  <li>make sure photocopied and scanned documents are clear and legible;</li>
  <li>use black and white for documents unless colour is essential;</li>
  <li>put any photographs (both originals and photocopies should be in colour), maps, plans, etc, in a <strong>separate appendix</strong> and cross-reference them within the main body of the document;</li>
  <li>print documents on both sides of a page. You should use paper of good enough quality that something printed on one side of the page does not show through to the other side;</li>
  <li>ensure that the scale and orientation of any maps and plans are shown clearly. If you are sending maps or plans by email or through GOV.UK you <strong>MUST</strong> tell us the paper size;</li>
  <li>do not send original documents unless we specifically ask for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.3. For further information please see Annexe F of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement appeals – England”</a> 
or Annexe D of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Certificate of lawful use or development appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>7.4. Both of these documents/annexes contain the same information about “Communicating electronically with us” and sending documents through the GOV.UK or by email.</p>

<p>7.5. You may wish to familiarise yourself with the content of the relevant “Procedural Guide” depending on whether you are interested in an enforcement appeal or a lawful development certificate appeal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Audio/video evidence</h2>

<p>8.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>8.2. However, you may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, the appellant and the LPA. Please send this within the 6 week deadline for representations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>The site visit</h2>

<p>9.1. The Inspector will normally visit the appeal site before a decision is made. If enough of the site and everything else the inspector needs to see can be seen from the road or a public viewpoint, the Inspector will view the site without anyone else being present.</p>

<p>9.2. Sometimes, both the appellant and the LPA’s representative will need to be present during the site visit.</p>

<p>9.3. There is normally no need for other people to attend the site visit. However, if you own a property nearby and consider that the appeal site needs
to be viewed from your property, you should tell us this when you write to us. If we decide the Inspector might need to see the appeal site from your property we will let you know the date and time of the site visit.</p>

<p>9.4. At the site visit, the Inspector will decide if it is necessary to view the site from your property. If so, the appellant and an LPA representative must come too.</p>

<p>9.5. As everyone concerned has to make their case in writing only, no discussion is allowed about the case during a site visit. The Inspector will be there purely to assess the effect of the development on the surroundings. However, he/she may ask factual questions to confirm his/her understanding of physical features of the site.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>10.1. All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>10.2. There is <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">guidance about costs awards in the Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a></p>

<p>10.3. It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>10.4. Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>The decision</h2>

<p>11.1. When made, the decision will be published on GOV.UK and can be viewed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Feedback, complaints and challenges</h2>

<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>

<p>12.1. We welcome feedback about people’s experience of dealing with us. This can be provided to us at any time. Please send these to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Complaints</strong></p>

<p>12.3. If after the decision on an appeal has been published, we receive a complaint against an Inspector’s decision or the Inspector or the way we administered a case it is dealt with by the Customer Quality Team who are independent of the teams who process cases. All complaints are investigated thoroughly and impartially. Further information on our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> is available on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>

<p>12.4. To be successful, you would have to show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an error had been made in law; or</li>
  <li>we did not follow the proper procedures and that your interests may have been harmed.</li>

<p>12.5. If your challenge is successful, the Court will return the appeal to us for it to be decided again. This does not necessarily mean that the original decision will be changed or reversed. For further information please see Annexe H, “How can a decision be challenged?” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement appeals – England”</a> or Annexe G of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/certificate-of-lawful-use-or-development-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Certificate of lawful use or development appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>12.6. **In enforcement appeals: ** a High Court challenge can only be made by the appellant, the local planning authority or any other person with a legal interest in the land. If you have a legal interest in the land, to challenge an enforcement decision you must first get the permission of the Court. However, if the Court does not consider that there is an arguable case, it can refuse permission. Applications for permission to make a challenge must be received by the Administrative Court within 28 days of the date of the decision, unless the Court extends this period.</p>

<p>12.7. <strong>In lawful development certificate appeals:</strong> a High Court challenge can be made by a person aggrieved by the decision if they have sufficient interest in it. This could include interested people as well as appellants, local planning authorities and landowners. A challenge to a decision in the High Court must be made within 42 days (6 weeks). This period cannot be extended.</p>

<p>12.8. <strong>Other aggrieved people:</strong> may apply for judicial review by the Courts. The claim form must be filed with the Administrative Court not later than 6 weeks after the grounds to make the claim first arose. The Administrative Court can tell you more about how to do this – its contact details are at paragraph 13.4 below.</p>
