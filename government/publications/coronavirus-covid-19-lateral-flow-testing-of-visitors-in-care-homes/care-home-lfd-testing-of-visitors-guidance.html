<p>This guidance is for all care homes receiving lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test kits for testing visitors â including visiting professionals â who are not part of a regular testing programme.</p>

<p>Those who are part of a regular testing programme (such as regular NHS staff testing or testing for <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors) do not need testing on the door of the care home.</p>

<p>For further information on the regular staff and resident testing programme, please refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#care-home" class="govuk-link">care home testing guidance for residents and staff: <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> (England) document</a>.</p>

<p>Please be aware of any national restrictions around <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus">visiting care homes during COVID-19</a>, including which type of visits can be facilitated with testing.</p>

<p>Before you do anything:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read this guidance in its entirety</li>
  <li>make sure you have received all parts of your order</li>
  <li>ensure that your staff and visitors are fully prepared for testing days</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on how to prepare and manage lateral flow testing for visitors.</p>

<p>Testing visitors can reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission but it does not completely remove the risk of infection. When used alongside robust infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures such as personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) it can support care homes to safely maintain a balance between infection control and the vital benefits of visiting to the health and wellbeing of residents.</p>

<p>For full guidance on how you can facilitate safe visiting in your care home, please review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus">visiting arrangements in care homes guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you have received a handheld scanner for easier registration, make sure you have set it up (see <a href="#set-up-scanner" class="govuk-link">setting up your handheld scanner</a> below) and familiarised your staff with how to use it.</p>

<p>Please note, scanners are being rolled out in phases, if you have not received one yet, you will soon.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements</h2>

<p>Visitors need appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> upon entry into the care home and throughout their visit including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disposable gloves</li>
  <li>disposable plastic apron</li>
  <li>surgical, fluid resistant face mask</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn during testing and throughout the visit. Visitors should not take off their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> until they end the visit when they should do safely in a controlled way. They can continue to wear the same <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for the duration of their visit unless it is contaminated, in which case they should change their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. For additional allowances for the visit, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#results-guidance">results guidance</a> section below.</p>

<p>It is the care homes' responsibility to ensure appropriate <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are followed in line with the care home and national policy.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing technology</h2>

<p>Lateral flow antigen testing involves processing a throat and nasal swab sample with an extraction fluid and a lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> detects a COVID-19 antigen that is produced when a person is infectious with COVID-19. If this antigen is present, then a coloured strip will appear which indicates a positive result.</p>

<p>We will be providing you with Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test Kits. <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFDs</abbr> find at least half of the cases that <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing detect and about three-quarters of those who have very high amounts of virus present when an individual is tested. High amounts of virus means that an individual is more likely to be infectious.</p>

<p>Lateral flow testing is not a foolproof solution: it should be seen as an addition to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures and must not be seen as a way of relaxing their use.</p>

<h3>Safety considerations</h3>

<p>Visitor testing must be conducted in line with other safety and risk management protocols, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>separating the visitor testing workflow from other parts of the home</li>
  <li>cleaning the testing area between tests and following <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> contamination protocol</li>
  <li>visitors putting on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> during testing and visit and complying with existing care home guidance on infection prevention and control measures</li>
  <li>guidance on infection prevention and control measures (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ppe-requirements"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements</a> section below)</li>
  <li>keeping any devices used for registration clean between each use and following <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures carefully</li>
  <li>using clean and dirty entrances for the testing area, if possible</li>
  <li>having an agreed procedure for invalid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and any visitors who cannot or refuse to test (for more details, see <a href="#results-guidance" class="govuk-link">results guidance</a> below)</li>
  <li>for further visitor guidance and information on risks to consider, please review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus">visiting arrangements in care homes guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assurance</h3>

<p>We are developing a quality assurance (QA) process for care homes to ensure high quality and consistent quality standards are delivered. This QA process is still under review and we will provide more information as soon as it is ready. You will not need to take any action until further information is provided.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>It is essential that all staff who will conduct <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing complete the NHS Test and Trace online training. Each home will receive access to the training portal through an email from <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Each care home manager needs to ensure that testing staff have access to the training portal. Once access is granted, all testing staff are required to watch the training videos and complete the online assessment.</p>

<p>If you have not received an email with access details, please call 119.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Kits can be stored at room temperature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store extraction solution at 2 to 30 degrees Celsius</li>
  <li>store the test cartridge at 2 to 30 degrees Celsius</li>
</ul>

<p>Test kits need to be stored and separated from the standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits. <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests kits are provided for routine testing of residents and staff (and confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for those visitors who return a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result).</p>

<h3>Waste management</h3>

<p>Dispose of used <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests in a health care waste bin.</p>

<h2>Setting up your handheld scanner</h2>

<ul>
  <li>turn off your computerâs power before connecting the scanner</li>
  <li>plug the cable into the bottom of the scanner and plug the other end into a computer</li>
  <li>turn on the computer once the scanner is fully connected</li>
</ul>

<p>The computer should recognise the scanner automatically as a USB keyboard device.</p>

<h3>Registering with a handheld scanner</h3>

<p>To use the scanning device when registering a single person on the registration portal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the page âEnter the unique test kit barcodeâ, select the âTest kit barcode referenceâ.</li>
  <li>Scan the barcode using your handheld scanner. This automatically registers the barcode.</li>
  <li>Select âConfirm test kit barcode referenceâ.</li>
  <li>Select âContinue.</li>
</ol>

<p>Further instructions on how to use the handheld scanning device are located on the <a rel="external" href="https://organisations.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" class="govuk-link">registration portal</a>, under the drop down field in blue âhow to use a barcode scannerâ.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing process overview</h2>

<p>This section provides an overview of the testing journey. Further detail about each step is provided in the numbered sections below.</p>

<h3>Initial order</h3>

<p>Test kits will be ordered on your behalf and you will be sent an initial order confirmation when they are sent. You will receive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kits, standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits for confirmatory PCRs, and a box of supplementing kit.</p>

<p>Start planning in advance so that you are ready to begin testing when the test kits are delivered to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>communicate the testing approach to all staff who will conduct the testing</li>
  <li>read this guidance and ensure all relevant staff take the NHS online training</li>
  <li>plan out your testing area and workflow</li>
  <li>ensure you have enough of the appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for staff and visitors and make sure you are signed up to the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://nhs-ppe.co.uk/customer/authentication">NHS <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal</a> (using your <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered email address) to order more</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prepare visitors</h3>

<p>Along with preparing your staff and home, schedule visits in advance and inform visitors of testing guidance and expectations. Make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>share the visitor testing guidance pack and letter to care home visitors with families of all residents to communicate the plan for using testing for visitors to your care home</li>
  <li>prepare consent forms to gain formal consent for testing and sharing results</li>
  <li>schedule visitor testing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prepare testing area</h3>

<p>On the days of testing, set up the testing area in your care home, including a check-in area and place to conduct testing and await results.</p>

<p>Key considerations for the testing area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure there is a separate area for visitors to test and await results without entering other parts of the home</li>
  <li>if possible, this area should have a separate entrance. If this is not possible, visitors should don <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before entering the care home</li>
  <li>make sure the visitor can enter and immediately put on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>follow other key considerations include social distancing, disability access, and fire safety regulations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conduct testing</h3>

<p>Prepare for testing days. Each visitor must be tested prior to every visit.</p>

<p>For each day of testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide visitors with <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> upon entrance and gain their consent to be tested</li>
  <li>make sure your home's unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>) is available to register test results</li>
  <li>prepare test kits including the swabs, extraction materials, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> devices and barcodes</li>
  <li>Prepare devices to use for registering visitor tests and results</li>
  <li>make sure to support visitors with registering their test kits online, if needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analyse test samples</h3>

<p>A trained member of staff analyses and interprets results. Make sure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow the test instructions to prepare, collect and record sample results</li>
  <li>note the ID number on each <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> (a QR code) against the time each sample was placed onto the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Communicate the results to each visitor. The visitor registers their test kit result online (or member of staff on behalf of visitor).</p>

<p>If a <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> is positive, the visitor needs to take and register a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on site. Then they should return home and isolate immediately. If their confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive, their household or bubble will also need to self-isolate and NHS Test and Trace may be in touch to contact trace.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1 Preparing </span> your visitors</h2>

<p>These test kits are available for testing visitors and visiting professionals prior to every visit.</p>

<h3>Visitors</h3>

<p>A visitor is defined as any relative or friend wishing to visit a resident. Visitors need to be tested every time that they visit, even though most will be constant and recurring visitors. For further guidance on visiting, please review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus">visiting arrangements in care homes guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Visiting professionals</h3>

<p>A visiting professional is defined as anyone visiting the care home in a professional capacity, for example a chiropodist. Some visiting professionals, including NHS staff and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors will already be part of a regular testing regime, and therefore they will not need testing on the door of the care home. Professionals not part of a regular testing regime will need to be tested every time they visit a care home.</p>

<h3>Visitor expectations</h3>

<p>Visitors will need to be prepared to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consent to testing and sharing results</li>
  <li>register their own test kit result online, or agree to share personal information if you support them with registration</li>
  <li>complete a self-administered throat and nasal swab</li>
  <li>prepare to wait 30 minutes for a result before visiting</li>
  <li>wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> during testing and, if their test result is negative, during their visit</li>
  <li>follow all other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> protocols and safety requirements during the visit</li>
  <li>complete a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test is positive</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visitor preparation checklist</h3>

<ul>
  <li>share the visitor testing guidance pack and letter to care home visitors with objectives of testing and expectations for visit</li>
  <li>prepare consent forms to receive written consent to testing</li>
  <li>schedule visits according to the time it will take to test each visitor (approximately 45 minutes to one hour)</li>
  <li>ensure you have enough <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and can support visitors with putting it on and taking off</li>
  <li>provide visitors with your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> and web devices to support with registration</li>
</ul>

<h3>What happens with a positive result?</h3>

<p>If a visitor tests positive, the visit cannot occur. The visitor will need to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit on site and immediately self-isolate, following government guidelines while awaiting their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result.</p>

<p>Make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you provide the visitor with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit and they complete testing on site</li>
  <li>you schedule a priority courier pick up</li>
  <li>the visitor registers their test kit online using the âtesting yourself at homeâ instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>The visitor should then immediately return home, avoiding public transport and wearing a face mask. If the visitor's confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive, their household and bubble will also need to self-isolate and NHS Test and Trace may be in touch to contact trace. For more information on visiting, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#results-guidance">results guidance</a> section.</p>

<h3>Getting consent and registering results</h3>

<p>Visitors will need to provide consent to be tested and share their results. Consent needs to be obtained before any testing occurs. You can modify any consent forms you currently use to reflect this new process.</p>

<p>Once test results are determined, visitors should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">report their test result online</a>. You should provide a web-enabled device, if possible, to support any visitor who doesnât have a mobile phone.</p>

<p>A web-enabled device includes a mobile phone or iPad, or a computer if you plan to register results after each testing day. Make sure the device is kept clean between each use and that <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are carefully followed. If a member of staff or visitor has to use a device in the middle of the testing process, the device should be cleaned and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be replaced appropriately.</p>

<p>What the visitor will need for registration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details, including DOB, gender and ethnicity</li>
  <li>contact information including email address and mobile number</li>
  <li>the ID number of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> (a series of numbers and QR code on the actual device)</li>
  <li>date and time of test</li>
  <li>the test kit result</li>
  <li>your unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>). If you donât know it, <a href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">look up your <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr></a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Registration should happen as soon as the test result is determined (but no later than one day after testing).</p>

<p>If a visitor is unable to register their own result, you can register the test on their behalf. Because the registration form asks for personal information, you will need these details from each visitor and must state how you will use those details, how long you will keep that information, and who you will share it with. Make sure you delete or destroy any forms containing the visitorâs personal details as soon as you complete the online registration.</p>

<p>For more information on registering test results, see the <a href="#register-record-results" class="govuk-link">register and record results</a> section.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2 Preparing </span> the testing area</h2>

<h3>Before you start</h3>

<p>Prepare for day of testing and make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a separate area for visitors to carry out self-administered swabbing and wait on results, maintaining social distancing</li>
  <li>you have your visiting schedule planned accordingly to take into account time for testing</li>
  <li>you have prepared written consent forms for all visitors to be tested in line with your normal policies and procedures</li>
  <li>devices are set up for registration and the <abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr> is visible for visitors to register online</li>
  <li>if you have received a handheld scanner for easier registration: make sure you have set it up and familiarised your staff with how to use it. For a quick start guide on how to use the scanning device, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#set-up-scanner">setting up your handheld scanner</a> section above</li>
  <li>you are prepared to have a clear record of which barcode matches which result</li>
  <li>you have a mirror, timer, permanent markers, hand sanitiser, tissues, and clinical waste bins in the testing area</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing process checklist</h3>

<ul>
  <li>visitor checks in</li>
  <li>take swab sample (tonsils then nose)</li>
  <li>process the sample and apply it to the rapid test</li>
  <li>wait 30 minutes then read results</li>
  <li>register the test kit and result online</li>
  <li>post-test action</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparing the check-in area</h3>

<p>Make sure you have the necessary <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for visitors.</p>

<h3>Preparing the testing area</h3>

<ul>
  <li>swab, inside sealed wrapper</li>
  <li>extraction tube</li>
  <li>extraction solution</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> cartridge</li>
  <li>clean cup to prop up the extraction tube (not provided)</li>
  <li>devices for registration support (if the visitor cannot use a mobile phone)</li>
  <li>handheld scanner provided by the National Testing Programme to speed up the registration process of test kits, if you have one</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3 Visitor </span> arrival and check-in</h2>

<p>As each visitor enters they are provided <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and checked in against the visitors list, consent to testing, and confirm they do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>Take down registration details (if the visitor cannot register their own test kit).</p>

<p>If a visitor will not be able to register their own result online, make sure to explain that you are asking for their personal information to register the test kit on their behalf.</p>

<p>To complete the registration form, take down the following personal details of each visitor being tested. These details can be recorded before or after the testing process occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>home address</li>
  <li>contact details, including mobile number and email address</li>
</ul>

<p>The visitor should now move to the testing area.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4 Sample </span> collection</h2>

<p>Test kit preparation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the processing operative attaches the visitor's barcode to the back of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> cartridge</li>
  <li>the operative prepares other parts of the test kit including the extraction tube and extraction solution to process individual samples</li>
  <li>the processing operative then hands the visitor the packaged swab</li>
</ul>

<p>Visitor self swabs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the visitor un-packages the swab and self-administers the swab sample for both the throat and nose (10 seconds on each swab sample)</li>
  <li>the visitor should hold their used swab until the processing operative is ready to process their test sample. It is critical that no one touches the end of the swab</li>
</ul>

<p>Extraction preparation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the processing operative places the extraction tube in a small cup to keep it upright and then puts the extraction solution into the tube (without touching the edge of the tube)</li>
</ul>

<p>Swab handover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the processing operative then takes the used swab from the visitor</li>
</ul>

<p>The visitor can move into the waiting area after they hand over the swab.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5 Sample </span> analysis</h2>

<p>Swab processing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the swab is inserted head-first into the extraction tube</li>
  <li>hold and press the swab head against the wall of the tube while rotating for about 10 seconds</li>
  <li>squeeze the lower end of the tube while removing the swab in order to remove as much liquid as possible from the swab</li>
</ul>

<p>Swab extraction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take out the swab while squeezing the tube and fabric end of the swab to squeeze as much fluid out as possible</li>
  <li>place the swab into the plastic bag provided and dispose of it in the clinical waste bin</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare nozzle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>press the nozzle cap tightly on to the tube</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> cartridge processing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>squeeze 2 drops of the solution into the sample well of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> cartridge (marked with an âsâ) and record the time of test (for example, âDrop at 11amâ) in marker pen on the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6 Results </span> analysis</h2>

<p>Results development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> cartridge to an area where results will be processed and start the timer to track the development of the sample</li>
  <li>results can be analysed after 20 to 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>Results interpretation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the results are interpreted by examining the presence of coloured lines on the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>positive results can be reported at 20 minutes</li>
  <li>negative results can be reported after 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>If a positive signal appears after 30 minutes, it should not be reported as positive. Line C must be coloured to have a valid test result</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/114521/LatFlow-960x640.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>Marking results:</p>

<p>The test is then marked by a permanent marker and removed from the desk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mark with a plus (+) sign for positive tests</li>
  <li>mark with a V for invalid and void tests</li>
  <li>mark with a minus (-) sign for negative tests</li>
</ul>

<p>You should now communicate the result to the visitor and register their test kit online.</p>

<h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">8 Results </span> guidance</h2>

<p>Once the result is registered, you can notify the visitor and follow the associated guidance on their visit.</p>

<h3>Negative result</h3>

<p>The visitor can proceed with the visit if other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are adhered to.</p>

<p>The visitor is allowed a more meaningful visit similar to what a normal visit would look like, for example handholding or entering the residentâs room.</p>

<p>The visitor should only enter designated parts of the care home and must wear appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> including a face mask, gloves, apron and follow <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures in line with the care home and national policy.</p>

<p>Direct contact should be discouraged except when there is a strong emotional or physical need.</p>

<p><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures remain important because the test is not 100% sensitive.</p>

<h3>Invalid result</h3>

<p>Re-test using a spare <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kit to receive a conclusive result.</p>

<p>If the retest comes back as invalid, we recommend that the visitor can only visit with an outdoor or screened visit similar to visitors who have not been tested. Other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures like social distancing, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, and other safety measures must be followed.</p>

<h3>Positive result</h3>

<p>The visitor can no longer proceed with the visit and needs a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Give the visitor a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit and ask them to test on-site then isolate at home immediately, avoiding public transport (if possible) and wearing a face mask.</p>

<p>Before the visitor leaves, they will need to register the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit on-line using the âtesting yourself at homeâ instructions. After registration is complete, you will need to schedule a courier to pick up the test kit.</p>
