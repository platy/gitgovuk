<p>Please note that close-contact indoor visits to care homes supported by <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> cannot currently take place due to national lockdown. The guidance in this document applies only when these restrictions are lifted.</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Visiting is a central part of care home life. It is crucially important for maintaining health and wellbeing and quality of life for residents. Visiting is also vital for family and friends to maintain contact and life-long relationships with their loved ones and contribute to their support and care (often as essential carers).</p>

<p>To support meaningful visiting, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is rolling out new rapid tests to care homes to test visitors. This will enable care homes to offer regular testing of visitors, to support more meaningful visits with loved ones.</p>

<p>While testing visitors can reduce the risk associated with visiting, it does not completely remove the risk of infection. When used alongside robust infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures such as personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), it can support care homes to safely maintain a balance between infection control and the vital benefits of visiting to the health and wellbeing of residents.</p>

<p>Friends and relatives have a very important role and responsibility to help care homes keep their loved ones safe. Please think of yourself as part of a team with the care home staff. By carefully following the steps described below you will be playing your part in helping to protect not just your loved one, but all the people with whom they share their home, from the risk of infection.</p>

<h2>What to expect with lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) testing in care homes</h2>

<p>Care homes will contact relatives and friends of residents to let them know when testing for visitors will be made available. You will be asked to complete a test every time you visit.</p>

<p>Please read this visitors guidance pack carefully so that you know what to expect for your visit, as well as the precautions the home will ask that you take to keep your loved ones and all their residents and staff safe.</p>

<p>In the event of an outbreak in a care home, please note that apart from in exceptional circumstances, visits will not be allowed.</p>

<h3>Do I have to be tested in order for me to visit my relative?</h3>

<p>Testing is really important to help us to identify people who might be carrying coronavirus but not showing symptoms. Testing may not identify everyone who is currently infectious, but alongside wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and following other infection prevent and control measures, testing helps us to keep our care home and your loved ones safe.</p>

<p>If you do not want to take a test or testing is not available on the day you visit, please do discuss this with our care home manager. Without testing, indoor visits may still be possible in some areas provided they are limited to 2 people, with social distancing, no physical contact, full <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and good hand hygiene observed at all times. Testing is by far the preferable option and should be used where possible.</p>

<p>Outdoor visits and those where the resident and visitor are separated by a substantial screen can be made available without the need for testing.</p>

<p>The home will decide how best to manage visits based on clinical guidance on infection control and testing and will talk through possible options for visits. Please be aware that organised visits are at the home’s discretion, and based on an individualised risk assessment, the care home manager may advise that it might not be possible to facilitate visits with you at this time.</p>

<h2>Preparing for your visit</h2>

<p>To keep your loved one and the care home safe, we ask that you please follow the below guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stay home if you’re feeling unwell, including if you have a fever, a cough or a change in your sense of taste and smell</li>
  <li>follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national guidance</a> outside of your visit, including limiting your contact with other people and wearing a face covering in indoor settings where social distancing may be difficult, and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet</li>
  <li>observe social distancing with anyone outside of your household or bubble and wash your hands regularly</li>
</ul>

<h2>On the day of your visit</h2>

<p>You’ll be asked to take a test using a new technology called a lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test. You’ll be tested before visiting your relative to check if COVID-19 can be detected. Lateral flow testing is not a foolproof solution: it should be taken in addition to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures and must not be seen as a way of relaxing their use.</p>

<p>For this, the home will ask you to do a throat and nose swab every time you visit and then will let you know your result in 30 minutes. The home will ask you to complete the swabbing yourself, supervised by a staff member. A swab is a small piece of soft, absorbent material on a plastic stick that is used to take a sample from your nose and throat.</p>

<p>The test is very straightforward and you’ll be supported throughout the process by a trained member of staff from the care home.</p>

<h3>Key steps during the test</h3>

<h4>When you first enter the care home</h4>

<ul>
  <li>a staff member will provide Personal Protective Equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) and support you with putting it on. This will include gloves, mask and apron. <a class="govuk-link" href="#putting-on-ppe">See instructions for putting on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> for more details on how to properly put on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a staff member will take your temperature</li>
  <li>you’ll be asked to sign a consent form that you agree to taking the test and sharing your result. The home may also ask that you share personal details including your date of birth, ethnicity, and contact details to support you with registering your test result. Registering your test result is important because it links you to your individual test kit</li>
  <li>a staff member will check you in for your visit</li>
</ul>

<h4>Taking your test</h4>

<ul>
  <li>after you check in for your test, a member of staff will direct you to move to the testing area</li>
  <li>a member of staff will hand you a packaged swab</li>
  <li>you will then need to take your own throat and nose swab, supervised by a member of staff. They will walk you through how to swab yourself which will only take about 30 seconds to do. See <a href="#self-swabbing" class="govuk-link">self-swabbing instructions</a> for more details on how to swab yourself</li>
  <li>once you have handed over the swab, you will be asked to wait in a designated area until your result is ready. This will take approximately 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Receiving your result</h4>

<ul>
  <li>after 30 minutes, a staff member will tell you your result</li>
  <li>once you have received your result, you will need to register your test kit online with your own mobile device or a device provided to you if you do not have a mobile. If you are not able to register your own result, a member of staff can help you but they’ll need to take down your personal details. See <a href="#register-test-kit" class="govuk-link">how to register your test kit</a> for more details on this</li>
</ul>

<h4>What your test result means</h4>

<p>Care home staff will help you process your test and give you a result within 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The result will affect whether you can complete your visit in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>positive – you will not be able to visit. You will have to take a second test, which is a confirmatory polymerise chain reaction (PCR) test that the home will provide for you. You will have to take the test and register it on site, then go home immediately and self-isolate until you receive your result. NHS Test and Trace will text, email, or call you with your result in around 72 hours. If you test positive, NHS Test and Trace may contact you to ask you for your close contacts</li>
  <li>invalid – the home will ask that you take another <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test. If the retest comes back as invalid, the home will recommend that you do not complete the visit</li>
  <li>negative – your visit will be able to go ahead, as long as you comply with all other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures (see below). It is possible that you may still have COVID-19, so the home will need to make sure you wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> at all times and ensure that the visit takes place in a safe way. If you have any questions about this, please ask the care home manager and staff for advice</li>
</ul>

<h2>During your visit</h2>

<p>It is important to recognise that a negative test will provide us with some assurance that you are not carrying the virus. However, the test is not a complete guarantee. To keep your loved one and the care home safe, we ask that you please follow the guidelines below during your visit.</p>

<p>Inside the care home, wear your face covering and any other <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that you were asked to wear by a member of staff. Please continue to follow their visiting policy.</p>

<h3>What you can do during your visit</h3>

<p>Holding hands and personal contact are allowed if you have a negative test result and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, but visitors should minimise contact as much as possible to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>

<p>Bringing food for the resident is also allowed.</p>

<p>During your visit, please make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you keep your <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> on at all times</li>
  <li>you only go to the part of the care home that is permitted for your visit</li>
  <li>you follow carefully any guidance and instructions provided by care home staff</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for putting on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Perform hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol hand gel.</li>
  <li>Put on a plastic apron, and tie it at the waist.</li>
  <li>Put on a surgical face mask, positioning upper straps on the crown of your head, lower strap at nape of neck. With both hands, mould the metal strap over the bridge of your nose.</li>
  <li>Put on plastic gloves.</li>
  <li>You are now ready to enter the care home testing area.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Instructions for removing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> safely</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Remove gloves; grasp the outside of the cuff of the first glove and peel off, holding the glove in the gloved hand, insert the finger underneath and peel off second glove.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snap or unfasten apron ties at the neck and let the apron fold down on itself. Break ties at waist and fold apron in on itself – do not touch the outside – this will be contaminated. Discard apron.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove surgical mask carefully, and put into clinical waste.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perform hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol hand gel or rub.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to register your test kit</h2>

<p>Once your result is determined, your test kit needs to be registered online using a self-test registration form. You can complete this form using your own mobile phone or a mobile device provided by the home. Once the form is complete, you will follow the appropriate guidance based on your result as set out above.</p>

<p>If you cannot complete this form yourself, a member of staff can complete it for you. They will ask you to provide some personal details required in the form.</p>

<h3>Details needed for the online registration form</h3>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>home address</li>
  <li>contact details (including mobile number and email address)</li>
  <li>test kit ID number</li>
  <li>date and time of your test</li>
  <li>test result</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please make sure that if you are completing this form yourself that you complete it immediately after you receive your result (and no later than one day after testing).</p>
</div>

<h2>Self-swabbing instructions</h2>

<p>You may remove your face mask to self-swab.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using the mirror to help, look inside your mouth, and find your tonsils at the back of the throat. Your tonsils or where they would be (if they had not been removed) are where you will swab your sample.</li>
  <li>Gently blow your nose into a tissue. Throw the used tissue into the clinical waste bin provided. This is so that you get rid of excess mucus.</li>
  <li>Use hand sanitiser to clean your hands. This is so that you do not contaminate the test kit.</li>
  <li>A member of staff will hand you a packaged swab. Identify the soft, fabric tip of the swab.</li>
  <li>Peel open the package from the handle-side of the swab and gently take it out. This will be used for both the throat and nose. Do not touch the soft tip of the swab.</li>
  <li>Holding the swab in your hand, open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip of the swab over both tonsils (or where they would have been) at the back of the throat with good contact at least 3 times (use a mirror to help you do this). Carefully remove the swab stick from the back of your throat.</li>
  <li>Put the same end of the same swab gently into one nostril until you feel a slight resistance (about 2.5cm or 1 inch up your nose). Roll the swab 5 times along the inside of the nostril.</li>
  <li>After collecting the sample hold the swab up right in your hand, do not put it down, and notify a staff member. Be careful not to touch any surfaces with the swab.</li>
  <li>You are ready to hand back your swab. Please notify a member of staff and use hand sanitiser after handing in you sample.</li>
</ol>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do not touch your tongue, teeth, cheeks, gums or any other surfaces with the fabric tip of the swab. The swab is invalid if it touches these parts, and you will need to get a new swab. If this happens, ask a member of staff to get assistance.</p>
