<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is intended for all care workers working in care homes in England. It can also be applied to visitors or essential care-givers within the care home setting.</p>

<p>This guidance is of general nature and is intended to be compatible with legislation. In the case that information in this guidance differs from a requirement in legislation, the legislation should be followed. The guidance remains under review and may be updated in line with the changing situation as required.</p>

<p>Employers and managers must provide workers with safe conditions of work, complying with all applicable legislation, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/legislation/hswa.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety at Work Act 1974</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-health-and-social-care-act-2008-code-of-practice-on-the-prevention-and-control-of-infections-and-related-guidance">Health and Social Care Act 2008: code of practice on the prevention and control of infections</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance has been developed in consultation with the Department for Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> Task and Finish group, which represents the adult social care sector. This included a review of ‘how to work safely’ resources assessed in view of new and emerging coronavirus (COVID-19) variants to ensure that guidance and advice remains stringent, comprehensive and reflective of the latest evidence.</p>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>Care home providers will need to consider how to put this guidance into practice in the context of their own circumstances. This guidance provides a minimum standard on <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> use, and organisations who adopt practices that differ from those recommended/stated in the national guidance are responsible for ensuring safe systems of work, including the completion of a risk assessment approved through local governance procedures.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this document, the term ‘personal protective equipment’ (<abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>) is used to describe products that are either approved by the Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) under personal protective equipment legislation or by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) as medical devices. Both are appropriate as protective solutions in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on circumstances.</p>

<p>Effective and appropriate use of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> is only part of the actions to take in reducing the transmission of COVID-19. The prevention and control of COVID-19 requires the inclusion of other measures including enhanced cleaning, ventilation, social distancing and hand hygiene.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus">visiting arrangements in care homes</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-reducing-risk-in-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">reducing risk in adult social care</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> must be used correctly and is only effective when combined with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning your hands regularly and appropriately for at least 20 seconds</li>
  <li>respiratory hygiene (‘<a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/south/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/catch-bin-kill.pdf" class="govuk-link">catch it, bin it, kill it</a>’) and avoiding touching your face with your hands</li>
  <li>following standard <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg139" class="govuk-link" rel="external">infection prevention and control precautions</a>
</li>
  <li>correct technique for putting on and taking off <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>safe disposal of used <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You must perform hand hygiene immediately before every episode of care and after any activity or contact that potentially results in your hands becoming contaminated. This includes after the removal of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>, equipment decontamination and waste handling. Follow your organisation’s policies and procedures on monitoring residents who are symptomatic or confirmed with COVID-19, permitted jewellery and hand maintenance (for example, keeping nails short, using moisturiser to keep skin on hands intact).</p>

<p>You should follow advice for the general public when outside of work (that is, before work duties commence and after work duties end). This includes following guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">wearing face coverings (not medical grade masks) when in enclosed spaces</a>, such as public transport and supermarkets.</p>

<p>For more information see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">how to stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h2>Determining the <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> to use</h2>

<p>You need to take precautions to protect your own health and to prevent passing on infection to people you care for. We recommend you use <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> regardless of whether the person you are caring for has any symptoms. The type of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> required will depend on the tasks you are carrying out and if the social distancing rules can be maintained.</p>

<p>Risk assessment involves assessing the likelihood of encountering a person with COVID-19, considering the ways that infection might be passed on and how to prevent this, including through use of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> you will use depends upon the risk assessment taken. The risk assessment should be based on the following 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Are you likely to be within 2 metres of a resident and carrying out direct personal care or domestic duties?</li>
  <li>Are you more than 2 metres from a resident undertaking domestic duties and not delivering personal care?</li>
</ol>

<p>The risk assessment is an organisational responsibility but should involve individual care workers. This will determine when and for which residents or duties items such as eye protection and Type IIR masks should be worn, for example when providing personal care for residents who are known to have respiratory symptoms or a known positive coronavirus test result within 10 days (14 days if medically advised).</p>

<p>You should discuss situations where you are unsure about with your manager. If after raising a concern you believe you are being asked to work in a way that is not safe, you should seek support, including from your union if you are a member, and consider whether making a disclosure to the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) is appropriate. There is further guidance available on <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20200420_Whistleblowing_quick_guide_final_update.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">raising a concern with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Exemptions on wearing face coverings in public are covered by regulations that do not apply to care settings. Where people may have difficulty wearing masks as required by this guidance, this should be discussed between you and your employer. If a mutually agreeable position cannot be reached to comply with the guidance, employees can refer to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.acas.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS)</a> for resolution, who can be contacted through their website.</p>

<p>It is not recommended to use homemade face coverings or cloth masks for staff delivering health and care activities.</p>

<p>See also <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm">making your workplace COVID-secure during the coronavirus pandemic</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/ppe-face-masks/index.htm#ppe-healthcare" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance from <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>There may be circumstances where following this guidance presents challenges in caring for the resident, for example, where lip-reading or facial recognition is especially important for care.</p>

<h3>Supported individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable</h3>

<p>Residents who are clinically extremely vulnerable or at higher risk from COVID-19 may need additional precautions, for example avoiding contaminating surfaces that might be touched by the resident. If you have any concerns about whether your residents should belong to this group, then you should discuss this with your manager.</p>

<p>When delivering care to a resident who is clinically extremely vulnerable, please follow the sections on <a class="govuk-link" href="#within2metres">providing close personal care in direct contact with the resident(s)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#morethan2m">carrying out domestic cleaning duties</a>. The primary purpose of wearing <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> in this scenario is to protect the vulnerable individual.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance on shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable</a>.</p>

<h3>Supported individuals with learning disabilities, mental health problems, autism and dementia</h3>

<p>There may be challenges in following <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> recommendations and providing care particularly for people with learning disabilities, mental health problems, autism and dementia. For example, face masks may cause distress which can result in behaviour that may cause harm to the resident or others.</p>

<p>A comprehensive risk assessment should be undertaken for each resident identifying the specific risks for them.  It is important that in doing this you do not alter the <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> items in any way as this could reduce their effectiveness in protecting staff or the people you are providing care for.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-supporting-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-care-staff-supporting-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults">guidance for care staff supporting adults with learning disabilities and autistic adults</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Supported individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 or have been vaccinated</h3>

<p>The same <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> recommendations apply for personal care regardless of whether they have tested positive or not for COVID-19 or if they have had the vaccine.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccination programme is being rolled out across the country with the most high-risk groups being prioritised for the first dose. The aim of the programme is to protect those who are at most risk from serious illness or death from COVID-19. Everyone will receive a second dose within 12 weeks of their first. The second dose completes the course and is important for longer term protection. However, until we are confident that the virus is under control, it is vital that you continue to adopt practices that limit infections.</p>

<h2>Providing close personal care in direct contact with the resident(s)</h2>

<p>These recommendations apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to all residents, whether they have symptoms of COVID-19 or not</li>
  <li>to all personal care, for example assistance to use the toilet, changing dressings, and when unintended contact with residents is likely (for example, when caring for residents with challenging behaviour)</li>
  <li>to all staff including care workers, managers and supervisors and cleaners</li>
  <li>to essential care givers or visitors if they are carrying out personal care</li>
  <li>regarding eye protection, when you have risk assessed there is a risk of splashing of body fluids (including respiratory secretions) into the eyes</li>
</ul>

<p>Extra precautions need to be taken when undertaking aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>). Please see the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#AGPs">aerosol generating procedures</a>.</p>

<h2>Recommended <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> items</h2>

<h3>Disposable gloves</h3>

<p>Disposable gloves are single use. When worn correctly, single-use gloves protect you from contact with the resident’s body fluids and secretions. Single use means gloves must be changed between every contact with another person and while working with the same resident (for example after helping with using the bathroom). They should also be changed after using gloves for other activities, for example cleaning.</p>

<p>You must dispose of them immediately after completion of a procedure or task and after each person being cared for, and then wash your hands. You must take care not to touch your face, mouth or eyes when you are wearing gloves.</p>

<p>Disposable gloves may be worn for routine cleaning, however if chemicals are being used as part of a decontamination schedule a <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/harmful/coshh.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">COSHH</a> assessment must be carried out and the correct <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> worn.</p>

<p>The type of glove used should be based on a risk assessment of the task being carried out. There are a number of different types of gloves: vinyl, nitrile and natural rubber latex.</p>

<p>Vinyl gloves provide sufficient protection for most duties in the care environment, providing the gloves fit. 
If there is a risk of gloves tearing, or the task requires a high level of dexterity, or requires an extended period of wear, then an alternative better fitting glove (for example, nitrile) should be considered.</p>

<p>If a change of gloves is required during a task because the glove is torn or punctured, then wash your hands thoroughly making sure they are completely dry before putting on new gloves.</p>

<p>Providers need to consider the type of different gloves available for the duties you are doing. This includes the gloves required in relation to cleaning products; follow the manufacturers’ instructions.</p>

<h3>Disposable plastic aprons</h3>

<p>Disposable plastic aprons are required. They are for single-use only and are worn to protect your clothing from contamination when providing direct care or if there is a risk of splashing.</p>

<p>You must wear disposable plastic aprons when providing personal care and when exposure to body fluids is likely. Disposable plastic aprons are single use and you must dispose of them immediately after completion of a procedure or task and after each resident, and then wash your hands.</p>

<h3>Fluid-repellent (Type IIR) surgical mask</h3>

<p>A fluid-repellent surgical mask (<abbr title="fluid-repellent surgical mask">FRSM</abbr>) is required. Fluid repellent surgical masks are Type IIR surgical masks and provide additional protection from respiratory droplets produced by residents (for example, when they cough or sneeze). Wearing a Type IIR surgical mask also protects residents by minimising the risk of you infecting them via secretions or droplets from your mouth, nose and lungs.</p>

<p>A fluid-repellent surgical mask must be single use and disposed of after giving personal care to each resident, and a new fluid-repellent surgical mask applied when giving personal care to another resident.</p>

<p>A new fluid-repellent surgical mask must be used while providing personal care for different residents with respiratory symptoms or with a positive COVID-19 test. You should also remove and dispose of the mask if it becomes damaged, visibly soiled, damp, or uncomfortable to wear.</p>

<p>You should not touch your face mask unless it is to put on or remove it. Make sure the mask fits as snugly to the face as possible, this may include the need to adjust the face straps or ear loops. They should not be crossed over as this increases the gap on the cheeks. Consider trying a different mask if the fit is poor.</p>

<p>The mask is worn to protect you and to help to prevent you transmitting virus particles to others.  You should ensure that you have enough masks for the duration of your shift.</p>

<h3>Eye protection</h3>

<p>Eye protection is recommended for care of residents where there is risk of droplets or secretions from the resident’s mouth, nose, lungs or from body fluids reaching the caseworkers’ eyes (for example, caring for someone who has tested positive or is currently in isolation).</p>

<p>Eye protection can either be a face-shield (visor) or goggles. It may be designed for single use or designed to be used more than once if decontaminated correctly between uses.</p>

<p>Eye protection such as visors provide a barrier to protect your eyes from respiratory droplets (for example, produced by a resident with respiratory symptoms), and from splashing of secretions (for example, of body fluids or respiratory excretions). Eye protection should cover the eye or face completely so prescription spectacles are not sufficient. It should be used in conjunction with a fluid-repellent surgical mask and should not be worn instead of a mask.</p>

<p>Use of eye protection should be discussed with your manager and you should have access to eye protection while you are working. Personal prescription glasses are not a substitute for eye protection, you will need to wear a visor or googles as well.</p>

<p>If you are provided with goggles or a visor that is reusable, you should be given instructions on how to clean and disinfect and store them following the manufacturer’s instructions or local infection control policy. Please see section on <a href="#Cleaneyeprotect" class="govuk-link">using <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>: cleaning eye protection between uses</a>.</p>

<p>If eye protection is labelled as for single-use, it should be used for a single task (that is, a single episode of an individual resident’s personal care) and should then be disposed of after removal. Please see section on <a href="#whatdowithwaste" class="govuk-link">using <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>: what to do with waste including <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Carrying out domestic cleaning duties</h2>

<h4>Table 2: When more than 2 metres from a resident undertaking domestic duties and not delivering personal care</h4>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Disposable   gloves (vinyl or nitrile)</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Disposable   plastic apron      (unless there   is a risk of contact with bodily fluids or secretions or splashing onto your   clothing or the resident is within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test and in isolation)</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Surgical mask   (Type II)</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Eye protection      (unless the resident has had a positive   COVID-19 test and is quarantining, or has respiratory symptoms, or is unable   to comply with a 2-metre social distance rule)</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These recommendations apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where no personal care is being undertaken (if personal care is being delivered please refer to Table 1)</li>
  <li>whatever your role in care (these recommendations therefore apply to all staff including care workers, managers and supervisors and cleaners, for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>If unable to maintain 2 metre distance from anyone in the care home who has respiratory symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test within the past 14 days, follow recommendations in the section on providing close personal care.</p>

<h2>Recommended <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> items</h2>

<p>If you undertake cleaning duties, then you should use usual household products, such as detergents and bleach, as these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces. Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned more frequently. If you are within 2 metres of a resident, then you should wear a Type IIR mask, plus the gloves and aprons you normally use for cleaning.</p>

<h3>Disposable gloves</h3>

<p>Disposable gloves are required as per standard infection prevention and control precautions (for example, contact with residents’ bodily fluids or chemical hazards or if anyone in the household is shielding). Single use means gloves must be changed between every contact with another person and in-between tasks. Hands must be washed and dried, or if handwashing facilities are not available hands can be sanitised using hand sanitiser prior to putting on another pair of gloves.</p>

<p>Vinyl gloves provide sufficient protection for the majority of duties in the care environment, providing the correct size of glove is chosen according to the wearer’s hand size.</p>

<p>If there is a risk of gloves tearing, or the task requires a high level of dexterity, or requires an extended period of wear, then an alternative better fitting glove (for example, nitrile) should be considered.</p>

<p>If a change of gloves is required during a task because the glove is torn or punctured, then hand hygiene is needed after removal of the original gloves. Hands should be thoroughly dried to make the donning of new gloves easier and reducing the risk of gloves tearing before donning a clean pair.</p>

<p>Care home providers need to consider the types of gloves available for the duties you are doing. This includes the gloves required in relation to cleaning products.</p>

<h3>Disposable plastic apron</h3>

<p>Disposable aprons are only required where there is a risk of contact with bodily fluids or secretions or splashing onto your clothing or the resident is within 14 days of a positive COVID test and in isolation.</p>

<h3>Type II surgical mask</h3>

<p>Type II surgical masks are recommended as it provides a physical barrier but is not recommended if you are giving personal care to a resident.</p>

<p>The facemask must be single use and disposed of before leaving the resident’s room. A new mask must be donned before entering the next resident’s room.</p>

<p>You should also remove and dispose of the mask if it becomes damaged, visibly soiled, damp, or uncomfortable to wear and do not touch your face mask unless it is to put it on or remove it.</p>

<p>You should ensure that you have enough masks for the duration of your shift.</p>

<p>The maximum period of time for wearing a type II mask is 4 hours, and the mask must be changed if it becomes moist, wet or uncomfortable to wear.</p>

<p>In general, fluid-repellent surgical masks are not needed for domestic duties. However, if the care home already has a supply of fluid-repellent (Type IIR) surgical mask, these are acceptable.</p>

<h3>Eye protection</h3>

<p>You need to risk assess the need for eye protection. Eye protection is not required for infection prevention reasons unless you know that the resident has had a positive COVID-19 test and is self-isolating, or has respiratory symptoms, or is unable to comply with a 2-metre social distance rule. Ensure the eye protection is used as a disposable item of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> or as a reusable item in line with the manufacturers’ guidance. Eye protection may be indicated if there is a risk of splash hazard from the cleaning products.</p>

<h2>Using <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Putting on and removing <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You need to put on and take off your <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> at least 2 metres away from the person you are delivering personal care to. For more information, see the video on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes/covid-19-putting-on-and-removing-ppe-a-guide-for-care-homes-video">putting on and removing <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You will need to decide the best place to do this. For example, you could do so just before or just after entering the resident’s room.</p>

<p>Similarly, you should take off <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> when at least 2 metres away from the resident or any person who has a respiratory symptom or has tested positive and is in isolation.</p>

<h3>What to do with waste including <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Waste should be placed in a tiger striped (offensive) waste bag and can be disposed of in the usual waste stream unless the resident has symptoms of COVID-19, that is, a new continuous cough, a high temperature, a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell or has had a positive COVID-19 test and is still in isolation.</p>

<p>Waste from people with symptoms of COVID-19, waste from cleaning of areas where they have been (including disposable cloths and used tissues) and <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> waste from their care:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Should be put in a plastic rubbish bag and tied when three-quarters full.</li>
  <li>The plastic bag should then be placed in a second rubbish bag and tied.</li>
  <li>The rubbish bags should be put in a suitable and secure place and marked for disposal 72 hours later.</li>
</ol>

<p>Waste should be stored safely and securely kept away from children.</p>

<p>You should not put your waste in communal waste areas until the waste has been stored for at least 72 hours. After the 72 hours, the waste can be put into the normal domestic waste.</p>

<p>Do not put any items of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> (or face coverings of any kind) in the recycling bin.</p>

<h3>Cleaning eye protection (goggles and visors) between uses</h3>

<p>If your eye protection is reusable, you should check and follow the manufacturer’s instructions or local infection control policy on how to clean and disinfect between uses.</p>

<p>As a minimum, between uses you should clean with a neutral detergent wipe, allow to dry, disinfect with a 70% alcohol wipe and leave to dry; or use a single step detergent and disinfectant wipe, allowing the item to dry afterwards. You should store in a bag or lidded box to avoid possible contamination after cleaning and disinfection is complete.</p>

<p>Do not put eye protection on until it is completely dry. Cleaning of reusable <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> items that have been provided to you is your responsibility. Do not smoke and avoid contact with flames while wearing eye protection.</p>

<p>If your eye protection is single use, it should be disposed of after use.</p>

<h3>Supply shortage of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You should inform your manager if you are concerned about shortage of <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>. Your manager will be aware <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment">how to secure <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> and related supplies</a>.</p>

<h2>Aerosol generating procedures</h2>

<p>Most care home workers are not expected to undertake aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>), although some who are working in complex care may do so.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> is a medical procedure that can cause the release of very small particles of COVID-19 from the respiratory tract into the immediate area and can increase the risk of respiratory transmission to those in immediate area.</p>

<p><abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> which are sometimes carried out in the community setting include suctioning procedures with a resident with a tracheostomy, residents who are receiving continuous positive airway pressure (<abbr title="continuous positive airway pressure">CPAP</abbr>) or ventilatory support. Oral/pharyngeal suctioning (suctioning to clear mucus/saliva from the mouth) is not classed as an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Filtering face piece class 2/3 (FFP2/3) respirators or N95 respirators are only required when staff are undertaking <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>. Care workers in care homes are not generally expected to undertake <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> and therefore do not typically need to wear FFP3 or N95 respirators. Your organisation or manager will inform you if <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> are relevant to you and will train you in the required procedure and instruct you if respirators and/or additional precautions are required.</p>

<p>If you are unsure, ask you manager for clarification.</p>

<p>The list of procedures which are classed as <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> in relation to COVID-19 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tracheal intubation and extubation</li>
  <li>manual ventilation</li>
  <li>tracheotomy or tracheostomy procedures (insertion or removal)</li>
  <li>bronchoscopy</li>
  <li>dental procedures (using high speed devices, for example ultrasonic scalers/high speed drills</li>
  <li>non-invasive ventilation (<abbr title="non-invasive ventilation">NIV</abbr>); bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (<abbr title="bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation">BiPAP</abbr>) and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (<abbr title="continuous positive airway pressure">CPAP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>high flow nasal oxygen (<abbr title="high flow nasal oxygen">HFNO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>high frequency oscillatory ventilation (<abbr title="high frequency oscillatory ventilation">HFOV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>induction of sputum using nebulised saline</li>
  <li>respiratory tract suctioning*</li>
  <li>upper <abbr title="ears, nose, throat">ENT</abbr> airway procedures that involve respiratory suctioning*</li>
  <li>upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy where open suction of the upper respiratory tract occurs*</li>
  <li>high speed cutting in surgery/post-mortem procedures if respiratory tract/paranasal sinuses involved</li>
</ul>

<p>*The available evidence <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-infection-prevention-and-control-guidance-aerosol-generating-procedures">relating</a> to respiratory tract suctioning is associated with ventilation. In line with a precautionary approach, open suctioning of the respiratory tract regardless of association with ventilation has been incorporated into the current (COVID-19) <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> list.</p>

<p>It is the consensus view of the UK <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> cell that only open suctioning beyond the oro-pharynx (middle part of the throat) is currently considered an <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The evidence on respiratory tract suctioning is currently being reviewed by the <abbr title="aerosol generating procedure">AGP</abbr> Panel, an independent panel set up by the 4 Chief Medical Officers to review new or further evidence for consideration.</p>

<p>Further information on <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> including <abbr title="personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr> recommendations for staff performing <abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> can be found in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-aerosol-generating-procedures">personal protective equipment use for aerosol generating procedures</a>.</p>

<h2>Other situations where facemasks are needed</h2>

<p>If you have been giving personal care to residents and you are changing your work duties, for example, going to the staff only area or the office, then you need to remove and dispose of your face mask, clean your hands and then put on a new Type l or Type ll face mask.</p>

<p>Type 1 surgical masks do not protect you but they may reduce spread of COVID-19 by preventing you from passing on the virus to other people (for example, through respiratory droplets or via your hands after touching your mouth or nose and then touching surfaces). A Type IIR mask could also be used, if lower specification masks are not available.</p>

<p>You should maintain social or physical distance of 2 metres where possible. If eating or drinking, you should remove your mask, dispose of it and clean your hands. Once finished eating or drinking, put on a new mask.</p>

<p>Car sharing is not permitted with someone from outside your household or your support bubble unless your journey is undertaken for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#travelling-within-england" class="govuk-link">exempt</a> reason. If you have to share a car, wear a face mask, clean the vehicle before and after use and open windows or car vents for ventilation.</p>
