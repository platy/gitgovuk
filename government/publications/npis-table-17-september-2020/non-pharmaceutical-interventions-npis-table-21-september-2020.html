High levels of compliance with stay at home orders in March and April although trust in government communication, perceived risk and levels of worry have declined since early April. However, perceived risk may increase in line with urgency and magnitude of policy change and may be rising already. Messaging is critical. “Stay at home” is a simple, clear message, which will boost adherence. Positively frame adherence to these behaviours, for example recognising the sacrifice and challenge. Community-level co-production of support measures, messaging and guidance should follow national standards. This may improve trust and adherence. To clearly define community (for example based on ethnicity, culture, age, gender, intersection) and recognise within group differences to ensure measures and messages are relevant for target community <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:v" class="govuk-link">[footnote ]</a></sup> . Harsh enforcement could exacerbate social divisions and lead to disorder. Note that allowing people outside the home for exercise was very important for mental health in the previous lockdown and not doing so would be hard to justify as the public now aware that this is low risk. Encourage vulnerable children to attend school for example by improving messaging to avoid stigmatisation. Substantial challenges for schools, further education and higher education with online teaching, including disparities between well off and less well-off areas. Disruption of lab-based and medical courses (such as dentistry) will impact the graduate pipeline into health roles.</td>

However, would only apply for a short period and so have limited effect. Modelling suggests that 14 days of significant reduction in transmission in October could put the epidemic back 28 days and could significantly reduce the prevalence of infection in December. As with all interventions the the earlier it is implemented (in the face of growing incidence) the higher the impact.</td>

Limited time period would limit the impact on deaths and hospitalisations, but reduction in these compared to the counterfactual would be maintained for several months and could be very substantial. Time lag from infection to deaths means reduction in deaths is likely to start after the circuit breaker ends. Lags also mean that impact on deaths likely to be appear as a flattening rather than decline.</td>

Risk of division and anger in community if education of children suffers, without explanation of the need <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vi" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote ]</a></sup>. Low confidence. Equity issues: as for “lockdown”, above. Stay at home is easier for those who can work from home, have sufficient space at home. Key workers, low income groups (which are disproportionately <abbr title="Black Asian Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>) groups have to continue to go to work so their workplaces have to be ensured to be Covid-secure. Important not to allow travel abroad for holidays for equity and to avoid people engaging in high exposure activities abroad during the lockdown period.

Adherence, health and trust will suffer if people are not given the resources they need to adhere safely. Again, community-level co-production of support measures can support adherence and financial support for mutual aid organisations from central government is necessary. Provision of mental health support is required – increased risk of mental health problems in <abbr title="Black Asian Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> groups where service provision requires further cultural adaptations to maximise effectiveness. Ability to plan will reduce impact, but debate about necessity (for example “why plan this, if rates are currently low?”) may increase social divisions. This should include how time gained by a circuit break is to be used for example to increase capacity for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace to cope with increased demand. Risk that people will try to see one another and engage in ‘allowed activities’ in significantly higher numbers if they know that restrictions are coming, causing increased transmission. This will require a targeted messaging campaign. If these activities are to prepare for restrictions by making arrangements for vulnerable or isolated friends and family then they should be presented in communications in a positive light.</td>

Policies may appear inconsistent (for example compared to work, schooling and hospitality if remain open), degrading trust, lowering perceived risk and impacting adherence. A clearly explained rationale, informed by likely effects on transmission as well as wider considerations such as social benefits and feasibility, may help to mitigate perceived inconsistencies to a degree. This should include allowing families to meet outside, as the public is aware that this is lower risk and where it is feasible it is highly valued. Where key workers benefit from extended kin networks and family support, especially intergenerationally, reducing household contact could preclude these key workers fulfilling essential roles <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:ix">[footnote ]</a></sup> . Differences between nations (number of households, inclusion of children) risk confusion and undermining the logic of the measure. It is important to be clear about why both numbers and networks (households) matter. Considerations of different types of households when specifying number of households. Houses of multiple occupation may limit ability to reduce contact due to shared communal areas and no social script or obligation towards one another. Language is key when communicating this as ‘bubbles’ was not well understood and did not translate well into a different language having no cultural context or sufficient meaning when translated for some <abbr title="Black Asian Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr> groups.</td>

Imposing restrictions on public assembly may also create unintended harms by increasing levels of protest, amplifying the numbers of unlicenced music events or house parties and provoking confrontations with police, and have a disproportionate impact on young people.

Need to explain the rationale behind closing playgrounds if the risk of transmission is lower between children. Enforcement is a challenge whether this means complete restrictions or limited numbers gathered outdoors. Need to prioritise different kinds of events and their social value in order for measures to make sense to the public. For example, Funerals, Weddings and Religious Festivals have a high importance in the life course of a community, while classical concerts do not. However, different events are valued by different communities, and it will create a sense of inequity if those valued by one section of the community (for example people of faith) are allowed but not those valued by another (for example young people). Consistency to increase legitimacy of this approach and avoid communities (for example. <abbr title="Black Asian Minority Ethnic">BAME</abbr>, low <abbr title="Lower socioeconomic status">SES</abbr>) feeling targeted with closure of activities affordable to them with other activities remaining open.</td>

      <td>Wearing facemasks outside of the house could complement existing government messaging of social responsibility if communicated alongside the effectiveness of masks in protecting others who are not infected. However, there are also a number of issues, risks and potentially harmful behaviours associated with recommending or mandating use of facemasks which could reduce their effectiveness (for example misuse, use of ineffective homemade masks). Moreover, it is critical that recommendations are seen to be based on the science and proportionate otherwise the legitimacy of. mask wearing overall will be compromised. Given that the evidence suggests outdoor spread to be very limited this may be seen. as an excessive measure.</td>
