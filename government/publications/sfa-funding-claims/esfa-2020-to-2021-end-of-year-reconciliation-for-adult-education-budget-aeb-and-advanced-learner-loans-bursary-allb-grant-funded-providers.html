<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We have lowered the reconciliation threshold for Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) grant funded AEB adult skills, including non-formula funded community learning and 19 to 24 traineeships, and ALLB providers for 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>

<p>The threshold will be lowered from 97% and 100% respectively, to 90% in recognition of the difficulties and uncertainties many providers are facing because of the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>In July, we confirmed that following the year-end claims submissions, whilst the 90% threshold remains unchanged, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/reconciliation-thresholds-for-esfa-grant-funded-providers-2020-to-2021">we are developing a process to consider business cases</a>. You can read more in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-claims/esfa-2020-to-2021-end-of-year-reconciliation-for-adult-education-budget-aeb-and-advanced-learner-loans-bursary-allb-grant-funded-providers#changes-to-the-threshold-for-2020-to-2021">change to thresholds section below</a>.</p>

<h2>Reconciliation process</h2>

<p>To incentivise delivery of adult skills and ensure value for money, we normally claw back any funding from ESFA grant funded providers (for the AEB adult skills and 19 to 24 traineeships) that under deliver below 97% of their grant allocation. For ALLB funding, we normally claw back 100% of under-delivery.</p>

<h2>Changes to the threshold for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Where providers deliver 90% or more of their AEB and ALLB allocations there will be no end of year recovery of funds.</p>

<p>Where providers deliver less than 90%, we will recover the difference between their actual delivery and 90%. For example, delivery of 85% would result in a recovery of 5% of the allocation. This change is for this year only, the reconciliation threshold will revert to its normal level of 97% for next academic year.</p>
</div>

<p>Your regulated and non-regulated provision along with learner support is combined with your non-formula funded community learning delivery to form your final delivery value. This is divided by the allocation value to calculate the final delivery percentage on which reconciliation is based.</p>

<p>The calculation for your delivery will only include delivery of non-formula funded community learning up to the value specified in your funding agreement (where applicable).</p>

<p>Allocations for the COVID-19 skills offer, including funding for the new level 3 adult offer, are ringfenced and the reconciliation threshold for under-delivery of this provision will remain unchanged at 97%.</p>

<h2>Considering business cases</h2>

<p>After extensive discussions with the sector, we are developing arrangements to allow grant funded providers, who cannot meet the reconciliation threshold, to apply for support on one or both of the following grounds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that local circumstances made it impossible for the provider to deliver at or close to the 90% level and recovery of funds based on the 90% threshold would lead to the provider’s costs of AEB delivery not being covered</li>
  <li>that applying the full amount of AEB clawback would cause significant financial difficulties for the provider</li>
</ul>

<p>The details of the new arrangements, including how this will operate, are being finalised and we expect to publish these in early September 2021.</p>

<p>Our primary aim is to support providers to continue to deliver as much quality provision as possible, including above the 90% threshold, whether that be face-to-face where permitted, online or otherwise remotely, and including through subcontracting (for AEB-funded provision only) where that is in line with our subcontracting requirements. Where providers are successfully delivering to adults, we will identify and share best practice to aid all providers.</p>

<p>We will seek to schedule recoveries from December 2021 following the final funding claims process as normal, and will preferably recover in full within the 2021 to 2022 financial year. We will work with providers that would like to request a phased recovery plan (up to 4 months).</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>We will continue to fund delivery up to 103% of providers’ ESFA funded AEB grant allocation (130% for 19 to 24 traineeships) in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>In areas where the AEB has been devolved, Mayoral Combined Authorities or the Greater London Authority are responsible for considering any provider flexibilities in their areas.</p>
