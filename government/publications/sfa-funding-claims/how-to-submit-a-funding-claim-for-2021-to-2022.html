<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Changes from 2020 to 2021</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Contract for services funded providers are no longer required to submit a claim for learner support delivery as this can now be claimed through the earnings adjustment statement (EAS)</li>
  <li>we have included national skills fund in the claim for grant funded providers</li>
  <li>we have included T levels in the claim for 16 to 19 funded providers</li>

<h2><span class="number">2. Introduction </span></h2>

<p>This document tells colleges and training providers which funding streams they should submit a funding claim for, how to make a claim and the dates for submitting a funding claim for the 2021 to 2022 funding year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Relevant to all funding claims</h2>

<p>For all formula funded deliverable lines, we will pre-populate the ‘delivery to date’ figures on the claim form based on your ILR/EAS data submissions.</p>

<p>You will not be able to amend this data.</p>

<p>For all non-formula funded deliverable lines, for example, community learning or learner support, you will need to enter a figure from your own records.</p>

<p>As a provider, you need to fill in the ‘forecasted delivery’ for each field for the mid-year forecast claim and year-end forecast funding claim for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>The forecast you provide in your mid-year and year-end forecast funding claims must be realistic and based on actual and or expected demand. Before submitting your forecast, you must ensure any funding errors identified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">post-16 monitoring reports dashboard</a> have been corrected in your latest data return. We will calculate provisional error values based on your data which we will include as an adjustment to illustrate the potential impact when you submit your final claim.</p>

<p>You only need to agree the figures in your final funding claim because we will use your ILR/EAS to pre-populate your actual delivery figures. We will account for any monitoring errors identified in your ILR data submission at this point. You will still need to enter figures for non-formula funded deliverable lines.</p>

<p>You must only use the ‘exceptional adjustments’ column in your final claim to make changes if you’ve agreed an exceptional adjustment with us beforehand. You must also retain relevant evidence (that we may request to validate your claim). Any unauthorised exceptional adjustments will not be included in your delivery figures.</p>

<p>You will have 4 working days (7 for final claim) after the relevant claim opens to submit your funding claim. If you do not submit a required funding claim in accordance with the dates in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table1">table 1</a>, then we will issue a minor breach notice, as this is a contractual requirement.</p>

<p>We will publish a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-claims">user guide</a> document giving further information on how to submit your funding claim.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. When </span> to sign a claim</h2>

<p>Final funding claims must be signed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Manage your education and skills funding</a> service by 1 November 2022. You do not need to sign mid-year and year-end forecast claims.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1. Who </span> needs to sign a claim</h3>

<p>An authorised person in your organisation must sign final funding claims. This can be the principal or another senior post holder who has the delegated authority.</p>

<p>They will need the contract authoriser or data returns and claims authoriser role in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Manage your education and skills funding</a></p>

<h2><span class="number">8. Audit </span></h2>

<p>The ILR data return and EAS are subject to ESFA’s audit and assurance regime to ensure the accuracy of ESFA funding claimed by a provider.</p>

<p>All providers must ensure that appropriate audit evidence is retained to support the ILR, EAS and all other returns made to ESFA. Where overclaims are identified we may instigate recovery action through data adjustments, offsetting or by invoice.</p>

<p>We will monitor the amount of funding you spend on support costs and may request additional evidence.</p>

<p>If your auditor tells you that you must make an adjustment to your funding claim because of an audit, you must amend your ILR data or make the agreed adjustment using the EAS.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. Reconciliation </span> statements</h2>

<p>For mid-year funding claims, we will not issue any statements.</p>

<p>For the following funding streams, we will issue an indicative and final reconciliation statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ESFA AEB – adult skills and community learning – grant-funded</li>
  <li>ESFA AEB – national skills fund level 3 offer for 24 years old and over – grant funded</li>
  <li>ESFA AEB – 19 to 24 traineeships (grant-funded)</li>
  <li>ALLB – grant-funded</li>
</ul>

<p>We will issue indicative and final reconciliation statements through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Manage your education and skills funding</a> service after your submitted year-end forecast and signed final funding claims.</p>

<p>The indicative statement will give you an indication of the funding you may need to pay back to us, and the final statement will confirm the amount to be paid back or if an additional payment is due.</p>

<p>Where provision was grant-funded, we will process monitoring errors identified in your R14 ILR data submission as an adjustment to your final reconciliation statement. If we are not satisfied that provision identified in the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard is eligible, we may need to request further evidence demonstrating the learners’ eligibility before we can publish your statement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you must pay amounts back to us, we will schedule those repayments from December 2022</li>
  <li>if you have an issue with your reconciliation value, you must tell us by 31 December 2022</li>
  <li>we will not consider any requests after this date</li>
  <li>we will publish your reconciliation statement(s) by 30 November 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Exceptional Learning Support (ELS)</h2>

<p>If you need to claim for learning support costs over £19,000 then you will need to go through the ELS process at the beginning of the learner’s programme. You can submit estimated costs and final claims for exceptional learning support by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptional-learning-support-cost-form">exceptional learning support cost form.</a></p>

<p>You must submit the ELS cost form for ESFA learners only, via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk" rel="external">Document Exchange on DfE Sign-in,</a> ensuring that you select ‘Funding Claim’ as the document’s purpose.  For full instructions, please refer to Section 1 of the exceptional learner support estimated cost form for 2021 to 2022.
