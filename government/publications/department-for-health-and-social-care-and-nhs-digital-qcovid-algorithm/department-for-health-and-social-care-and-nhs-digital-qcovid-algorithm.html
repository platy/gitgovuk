      <td>• The original version of the QCOVID algorithms were used as part of the Population Risk Assessment to add patients to the Shielded Patient List in February 2021. These patients were advised to shield at that time, were provided support for doing so, and were prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination.<br><br>• The tool has been designed to allow clinicians to input information about individuals in order to calculate risk of suffering adverse outcomes in the event that an individual contracts Covid.<br><br>• The tool estimates the likelihood of a particular outcome. It does not guarantee outcomes.<br><br>• The current version of the tool makes use of separate algorithms for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, but the original research methodology was not designed to establish the effectiveness of vaccines.<br><br>• The absolute risk estimates produced by the tool were ultimately derived from the study period used in the research. This predates new variants of the virus and other developments in population immunity, so the main purpose of the tool remains as a guide to personal relative risk.</td>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2.2 Benefit</th>
      <td>Tier 2 - Description</td>
      <td>Describe the key benefits that the algorithmic tool is expected to deliver, and an expanded justification on why the tool is being used.</td>
      <td>• The key benefits of the tool when it was used in the Population Risk Assessment was to identify individuals at a high risk who should&nbsp; be advised to shield and/or be placed into a high priority cohort for the vaccine rollout. The ultimate aim was to ensure protective interventions were targeted at the most vulnerable, to reduce mortality and protect the NHS.<br><br>• The clinical tool for clinicians is intended to support individual conversations with patients about risk. Originally, the goal was to help patients understand the reasons for being asked to shield and, where relevant, help them do so. Since the end of shielding requirements, it is hoped that better-informed conversations about risk will have supported patients to make appropriate decisions about personal risk, either protecting them from adverse health outcomes or to some extent alleviating concerns about re-engaging with society.<br><br>• Furthermore, the technology introduced a new capability, created at speed during the early stages of the pandemic, as it adds input to aid more targeted clinical interventions.<br><br>• The underlying principles that drive the tool may in the future lend themselves to application outside of COVID-19, particularly given that the technology has been proven in a real world application.</td>

      <td>Tier 2 - Description</td>
      <td>Provide, where applicable, a list of non-algorithmic alternatives considered, or a description of how the decision process was conducted previously.</td>
      <td>• Before the development of QCOVID, the Shielded Patient List was developed by identifying patients for protection on the basis of whether or not they had any of a list of medical conditions. This did not take into account demographic factors or combinations of co-morbidities which QCOVID was then able to accommodate in its decision-making process.<br><br>• England’s Chief Medical Officer commissioned a predictive model for a data-driven approach to COVID-19 clinical risk assessment which resulted in the development of QCOVID.</td>

      <td>Tier 2 - Description</td>
      <td>Indicate which types of methods or models the algorithm is using. For example, expert system, deep neural network and so on.</td>
      <td>• In essence, the tool creates a risk calculation based on scoring risk factors across a number of data fields pertaining to demographic, clinical and social patient information. This process is detailed below:<br><br>• The algorithm creates a risk prediction model - QCovid - that provides a weighted, cumulative calculation of absolute risk using the variables associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes.&nbsp; The research on which the model is based uses a Cox proportional hazards survival model using a range of health and demographic variables, excluding those not significant from final models used in decisions. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2244" rel="external">More information on the research behind the current versions of QCOVID</a>.<br><br>• The factors incorporated in the model include age, ethnicity, level of deprivation, obesity, whether someone lived in residential care or was homeless, and a range of existing medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease and cancer.<br><br>• For the latest clinical tool, separate versions of the QCOVID models were estimated for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. When using the clinical tool, clinicians enter patients’ vaccination status, and the tool uses this to determine which algorithm will be used in the calculations.</td>

      <td>Provide information on how regularly the algorithmic tool is being used. For example the number of decisions made per month, the number of citizens interacting with the tool, and so on.</td>
      <td>• The Clinical Tool has been used within and outside of the NHS. In the period between 1st January 2022 and 31st March 2022, there were 2,180 completed assessments. Increased uptake was driven, in part, due to increased access, as technical restrictions on who could access the tool were removed in January 2022.<br><br>• Assessment numbers often move with relative infection rate (e.g. higher infection rate leads to more usage of the tool).</td>

      <td>Give details on the maintenance schedule and frequency of any reviews. For example, specific details on when and how a person reviews or checks the automated decision.</td>
      <td>• Maintenance schedules for the algorithm are dictated by the emerging understanding of COVID and any new variants and therefore do not fit into a routine schedule.<br><br>• Changes are processed through a RFC (request for change) procedure and enacted by the NHS Digital delivery team.<br><br>• To date, maintenance has included the addition of extra data points to the algorithm (e.g. Vaccine status).</td>

      <td>• The use of the tool does not override any clinical decision making but is a supporting device in the decision making process.<br><br>• The tool amalgamates known factors about Covid at the time the tool was released. The update schedule for the tool isn’t confirmed as it is dependent on scientific understanding of new variants as they emerge.<br><br>• The tool promotes shared decision making with the patient and is an extra point of information to consider in the decision making process.<br><br>• The tool helps with risk/benefit analysis around decisions (e.g. recommendation to shield or take other precautionary measures).<br><br>• The tool is treated, in essence, as a clinical device (class 1) to aid decision making, not to make automated decisions by itself.<br><br>• As of April 2022, there are no further planned updates to the tool.</td>
