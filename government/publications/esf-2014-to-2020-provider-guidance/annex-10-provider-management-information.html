<h3>Living with COVID-19</h3>

<p>This guidance has been updated to include the interim arrangements that DWP, as CFO for our ESF 2014-2020 Programme, has put in place to allow you to continue to deliver provision now that all COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and the updated government advice has progressed to ‘Living with COVID-19’.</p>

<p>A blended delivery model is acceptable to the department longer term. However, please note, that whilst the Department supports a blended delivery model for all ESF funded provision, this must be based on participant need and the preferred method of delivery is face-to-face, where possible. Our Performance Managers will continue to monitor whether remote delivery is being overly relied upon and will discuss this with you during your monthly CPR meetings.</p>

<p>Your records should clearly state why remote delivery was the most appropriate and an email audit trail should exist to demonstrate paperwork was completed in agreement with the participant if no wet signature has been obtained.</p>

<p>As all COVID restrictions have been lifted and the updated Government advice has progressed to ‘Living with COVID-19’ it is no longer appropriate for ESF- related paperwork, completed when delivering provision remotely, to contain ‘COVID-19’ in lieu of a signature.</p>

<p>We are now asking that ‘COVID-19’ is replaced by ‘Remote delivery’ in the signature box for those participants who cannot be seen face to face. The ‘COVID-19’ wording will not be accepted on any ESF1420 Initial and End forms nor the Annex 1: ESF 2014-2020 Good New Story Template and Consent Form submitted from 7 May 2022.</p>

<p>When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained, and retrospective signatures should be attained when the participant is next seen in person and such form/s retained on file for audit.</p>

<p>The majority of current ESF 2014-2020 Provider Guidance, from chapter 1 to Annex 11 will still apply and are to be used in conjunction with the ‘Living with COVID-19’ period arrangements cited in the text boxes through this and other applicable chapters.</p>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 1: Set Up</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The provision you supply is funded by the European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) 2014-2020 Programme. As detailed in your contract, you are required to submit Management Information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) to ensure adherence to European Commission requirements.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 Programme has different requirements regarding the collection and reporting of <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> to previous programmes. Each individual participant record must be reported against a number of personal characteristics which are detailed in the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 1420 forms. The requirement to provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> standard <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>, processed through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, will continue and includes some of the <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> data captured on the ESF1420 forms. To ensure full collection of <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Providers are required to gather additional participant information on starting, leaving or completing provision.</p>

<h3>IT Requirements</h3>

<p>Users will require:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>access to Microsoft Office 2010 or later versions of this software including Word, Excel and Outlook applications. Outlook should be set as the user’s default email application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ability to scan and save documents in PDF format in order to send signed copies of the ESF1420 form by email to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b?ui=en-us&amp;amp%3brs=en-us&amp;amp%3bad=us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" rel="external">Outlook set up guide</a></p>

<p>You should have a specific folder set up in your directory to save the ESF1420 form to, along with its supporting folders. This folder can be named as you require for example with the name of the individual Advisor/Tutor. It is important that you keep the eESF1420 Excel file in the same folder as the accompanying ‘Extracts’, ‘Forms’ and ‘Templates’ folders.  The macros in the eESF1420 form will not work otherwise.</p>

<h3>Timescales for submitting data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h3>

<h4>Initial participant data collection (ESF1420 - <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Participant Referral Form (Initial))</h4>

<ul>
  <li>within 5 days of the participant signing the ESF1420 form</li>
</ul>

<h4>End participant data collection (ESF1420 - <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> End Data)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>within 8 weeks (4 week tracking period plus 4 weeks) of the participant completing provision. However, where it is later identified that this data was not submitted within this timescale, you should still supply <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with the data as soon as possible. It is an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirement that participant destination data is reported</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Participant ESF1420 Initial form must be signed by the participant and advisor/tutor, scanned and sent to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by email following the Initial Engagement Meeting.	End data forms are completed and signed by the advisor/tutor only, but still scanned and emailed as described in these instructions.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>For all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants, open the eESF1420 file to enter Initial Data or End Data for each individual participant.  The form has been configured for your specific contract.</p>

<p>You will have received a WinZip file containing documents for you to save to a predetermined folder on your local or shared drive.</p>

<h4>Screen shot 1</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/162401/screen-shot-one.png"></div></figure>

<p>Extract the zipped documents into a designated folder, this can be repeated for each advisor/tutor to use individually. You may rename the folder where the files are located but do not rename or move any of the extracted documents.</p>

<p>To extract the files, set up the destination folder first and copy the file path. Then highlight all four items:</p>

<p>eESF1420 Excel file and the ‘Extracts’, ‘Forms’ and ‘Templates’ folders. Select the ‘Extract’ icon from the WinZip menu and copy the destination file-path into the ‘extract to’ field.</p>

<p>You may need to check your email account instructions for unzipping/extracting documents as they may differ from those described above.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Save a copy of the files in a safe place in your directory. If your advisor/tutor copy becomes corrupted, you can then revert back to the master.</p>

<p>When you open the Excel document you should ‘Enable Macros’ and ‘Enable Editing’. If prompted, click ‘Yes’ to the message ‘do you want to make this file a trusted document?’.</p>

<h3>ESF1420 Provider Section</h3>

<p>The ESF1420 form has been pre-populated with relevant information required by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to process your <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> submissions.</p>

<p>The advisor/tutor must pre-populate the provider section with their name, email and phone number for these details to transfer onto printed copies of the Initial Data and End Data forms. This should be done before entering participant details. We recommended that each advisor/tutor uses their own copy of the form with these details saved.</p>

<h3>Inputting Provider Reference Data</h3>

<p>To access this screen please click on the European Union flag logo, (Circled in red on screen shot 2), then complete the boxes to enter the Advisor name, email and telephone number and select save (Screen shot 3).</p>

<h4>Screen shot 2</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/162402/screen-shot-2.png"></div></figure>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Screen shot 3</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/162403/screen-shot-3.png"></div></figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Once the advisor/tutor has completed this section, the form is ready to be used to record participant data during the meeting.</p>

<h3>Completing the Form</h3>

<p>The participant will need to sign the ESF1420 form generated at the end of the Participant Engagement Meeting. Ideally the electronic form should be completed while the participant is with you. Alternatively, you can complete a clerical version of the form and key-in the data to the electronic form later on.</p>

<p>To complete the electronic form, select the ‘Initial Data’ button (circled in blue on screen shot 2).</p>

<p>Use the blank fields and drop down options to complete each field. Instructions are detailed in Chapter 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-2014-to-2020-provider-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014 to 2020 provider guidance</a>.</p>

<p>When all fields are complete, click on ‘Next’ (circled in red on screen shot 4) to move to the next page. If any fields have invalid entries, a message will prompt what information is required for that field. You will not be able to move on from this page if any mandatory fields are not completed correctly. After completing Part 1 Participant Details, Part 2 Participant Characteristics and Part 3 Participant Eligibility, select ‘Finish’ (Circled in red on screen shot 5).</p>

<h4>Screen shot 4 – Part 1 Participant Details (example)</h4>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Screen shot 5 – Part 2 Participant Characteristics (example)</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/162405/screen-shot-5.png"></div></figure>

<p><br></p>

<h4>Screen shot 6 – Part 3 Participant Eligibility (example)</h4>

<h4>Screen shot 7 – Main Menu</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/162407/screen-shot-7.png"></div></figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>You will be returned to the main menu and options will be available to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amend (circled in red on screen shot 7)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save Extract - (circled in purple on screen shot 7) to use with the alternative email process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print ESF1420 - (circled in blue on screen shot 7) Note: You must select Print first before clicking Email, you cannot return to Print if you have clicked Email first. The form will have to be completed again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Email ESF1420 – (circled in green on screen shot 7) Note: You must select Print first before clicking Email if you need to capture the participant and advisor signatures on the form.  You do not need to print the form first if you are re-keying the information taken from a clerically completed form that has already been signed by the participant and advisor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print Clerical Forms – (circled in orange on screen shot 7) to use with the clerical process only. Note: clerical forms are not to be submitted as an alternative to the IT data string electronic version</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Printing the Form</h3>

<p>With the participant present with you, click ‘Print ESF1420’ and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> form will be generated in MS Word using the data you have input for the participant and also the pre-populated information.</p>

<p>If your default printer is not automatically selected, please assign the printer that you wish to use to print the form.</p>

<p>You can now show the participant the completed form so they can read through and sign the declaration; you can then sign the advisor/tutor section.</p>

<p>Do not exit the provider form; keep it open in the background.</p>

<h3>The Completed Form</h3>

<p>The completed and signed ESF1420 form now needs to be scanned and saved into your directory in order to attach to the email that will be generated in the next step.</p>

<p>Once the scanned and saved PDF version of the ESF1420 has been saved, please go to the main menu and select ‘Email ESF1420’.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Living with COVID-19: Completing the ESF1420 Forms – Signatures</h3>

<p>The ESF1420 Initial and End forms, should be annotated ‘Remote Delivery’ in the signature box to confirm the participant was enrolled during this event. The date should be included. All case notes held on file must reflect the conversations which have taken place with participants and reflect the information put on the forms.</p>

<p>Email evidence for audit should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme.</p>

<p>The rest of the ESF1420 form processing should remain in line with ‘Complete The Form’ section of this chapter pages 9-10 and can be submitted to the ESF 14-20 Admin Team as usual but any forms not signed ‘Remote delivery’ and dated will be rejected.</p>

<p>ESF1420 Initial Forms – Annotating the signature box with ‘Remote delivery’ is acceptable from 7 May 2022.</p>

<p>Whilst the department supports a blended delivery model for all ESF funded provision, this must be based on participant need and the preferred method of delivery is face to face. Our Performance Managers will continue to monitor whether remote delivery is being overly relied upon and will discuss this with you during your monthly CPR meetings.</p>

<p>Your records should clearly state why remote delivery was the most appropriate and an email audit trail should exist to demonstrate paperwork was completed in agreement with the participant if no wet signature has been obtained.</p>

<p>When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained and retrospective signatures should be attained when the participant is next seen in person and such form/s retained on file for audit.</p>
</div>

<h3>Emailing the Form</h3>

<p>An email will be generated containing metadata (text in the body of the email) with an attached Excel Spreadsheet detailing the participant’s <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> characteristics. This information is created by a macro and presented in the format required by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Can you please ensure when an ESF1420 form is submitted for the first time, that the appropriate heading is used within the email subject as follows:</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Live [Prime Provider Name]</p>

<p>If you are returning a form following correction, please include the following in the email subject:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Live ‘Resubmission’ [Prime Provider Name]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are submitting a form in a <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area that uses the wider/narrow eligibility options please use the following in the email subject:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Live ‘Wider or Narrower Eligibility’ whichever is applicable. Note, where the referred participants fall into both eligibilities please state the narrower one as this is still a key target.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must now attach the signed PDF copy of the form to the email (using the ‘Attach’ function rather than copy and paste) ensuring it is the correct form for the customer data in the email. Please attach the PDF next to the Excel file.</p>

<p>The Metadata which is automatically generated in the body of the email and the email address must not be amended, nor additional forms or data added.</p>

<p>Click on ‘Send’ and the email will be sent directly to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin Team.</p>

<p>You can now either ‘Exit’ the form to close down or click on ‘New Participant’ (circled black on screen shot 7) if you have another appointment.</p>

<h4>Important</h4>

<p>Always close the forms down using the Exit button on the main page. If you are on subsequent pages, use the ‘Back’ button to return to the main page and then the ‘Exit’ button.</p>

<p>Always ensure that the Word document is closed correctly using the ‘x’ in the top right hand corner of the document. If this is not done after completing each form the document will become locked ‘read-only’ with the previous participant details.</p>

<h4>Clerical Process</h4>

<p>If you are unable to meet the participant in a location which would allow you to print the form or send the email, you can take a clerical version of the form to the meeting. Circle the relevant response to each question and obtain the customer and advisor signatures on that copy. A scanned PDF copy will need to be created when you return to the office. The data from the clerical version will need to be keyed-in to the electronic Excel Initial or End data versions of the form, as appropriate. After completing the electronic version, attach the signed and scanned clerical ESF1420 to the email generated by the form and send it to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within 10 working days of completing the Initial Meeting or within 4 weeks of the participant leaving provision.</p>

<p>It is important that the electronic version accurately reflects the information gathered on the clerical form. When transferring data from the clerical form to the electronic form you may identify errors in how the clerical form was completed. This may require further clarification with the participant and any alterations to the participant’s personal details on the clerical form must be signed by the participant.</p>

<h3>Contract ID and Category of Region fields</h3>

<p>The ESF1420 form has been pre-populated with relevant information required by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to process your <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> submissions. The ‘Category of Region’ and ‘Contract ID’ will display on printed copies of the Initial Data form. The Category of Region will be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Less developed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transitional</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More Developed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Contract ID is a seven-digit number also shown in the eESF1420 file name.</p>

<h3>Special Customer Records</h3>

<p>If an individual has a Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) you must not keep any electronic records. The ESF1420 Initial and End forms must be completed and signed and a copy sent by post to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin Team.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-2014-to-2020-provider-guidance/chapter-3-participant-identification-eligibility-and-referral">Chapter 3 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014 - 2020 Provider Guidance</a> refers to the treatment of participants who have Special Customer Records.</p>

<p>The forms should be posted FAO:</p>

<p>The list below gives more information on the <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> LEVEL 1 Primary Education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> LEVEL 2 Lower Secondary Education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> LEVEL 3 - UPPER SECONDARY education Programmes at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3, or ‘upper secondary’ education, are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Programmes at this level offer students more varied, specialised and in-depth instruction than programmes at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 2. They are more differentiated, with an increased range of options and streams available. For pupils <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 begins after 8 to 11 years of education since the beginning of <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 1. Pupils enter this level typically between age 14 and 16. <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 programmes usually end 12 or 13 years after the beginning of <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 1 (or around age 18), with 12 years being the most widespread cumulative duration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> LEVEL 4 - POST-SECONDARY NON-TERTIARY education post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning experiences building on secondary education and preparing for labour market entry as well as tertiary education.
Individual acquisition of knowledge, skills and qualification does not grant such access. For example, graduates from general <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 programmes may choose to complete a non-tertiary vocational qualification; or graduates from vocational <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 programmes may choose to increase their level of qualification or specialise further. Given the complexity of their content, <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 4 programmes cannot be regarded as tertiary education programmes, although they are clearly post-secondary education. The completion of an <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 programme is required to enter <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 4 programmes. Usually, programmes at this level are designed for direct labour market entry. In some education systems, there are general programmes at this level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> levels 5 - SHORT-CYCLE TERTIARY, education Programmes at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 5, or ‘short-cycle tertiary’ education, are often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Typically they are practically based, occupationally specific and prepare students to enter the labour market.
However, programmes may also provide a pathway to other tertiary education programmes.
Academic tertiary education programmes below the level of a bachelor programme or equivalent are also classified as <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 5. Entry to <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 5 programmes requires the successful completion of <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 or 4 with access to tertiary education. Programmes at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 5 have more complex content than programmes in <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> levels 3 and 4, but they are shorter and usually less theoretically oriented than.  For example: higher technical education, community college education, technician or advanced/higher vocational training, associate degree, bac+2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 6 programmes often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions. Entry to these programmes normally requires the successful completion of an <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 3 or 4 programme with access to tertiary education. Entry to educational programmes at this level may depend on subject choice and/or grades achieved at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> levels 3 and/or 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Programmes at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 7, or ‘master or equivalent’, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification.
Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component, but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification.
Programmes at <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level 8, or ‘doctoral or equivalent’, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this <abbr title="International Standard Classification of Education">ISCED</abbr> level are devoted to advanced study and original research and typically offered only by research oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities.

<h4>Is the person engaged in education or training?</h4>
<p>Yes/No</p>

<h4>Is the person living in a jobless household?</h4>
<p>Yes/No/*Participant Chose not to say.
If no to this question the next question will automatically default to no.<br>
*Where possible, please encourage an answer to this question rather than the participant chose not to say.</p>

<p>Jobless households are households where no member is in employment, i.e. all members are either unemployed or inactive.
‘employed’ is defined as in the indicator ‘Employed, including self-employed’. ‘Inactive’ is defined as in the indicator ‘Inactive’.</p>

<p>A household, is defined as a housekeeping unit or, operationally, as a social unit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having common arrangements</li>
  <li>sharing household expenses or daily needs</li>
  <li>in a shared common residence</li>
</ul>

<p>A household includes either one person living alone or a group of people, not necessarily related, living at the same address with common housekeeping, i.e. sharing at least one meal per day or sharing a living or sitting room. The following are not interpreted as a household:</p>

<p>(i)	Collective households or institutional households (as opposed to private households). These are for instance: hospitals, old people’s homes, residential homes, prisons, military barracks, religious institutions, boarding houses and workers’ hostels, etc.</p>

<p>(ii)	In general, groups of students sharing accommodation are not considered to constitute a household because, even if they contribute towards shared common expenses such as rent or shared utility bills, they usually manage their finances independently The household situation is determined on the date of entering the operation.
An individual person may be recorded under a number of `disadvantage’ –related indicators</p>

<h4>Is the person living in a jobless household with dependent children?</h4>
<p>Yes/No/*Participant Chose not to say.<br>
*Where possible, please encourage an answer to this question rather than the participant chose not to say.</p>

<h4>Is the person living in a single adult household with dependent children?</h4>
<p>Yes/No/*Participant Chose not to say.<br>
*Where possible, please encourage an answer to this question rather than the participant chose not to say.</p>

<p>Jobless and Households: please refer to previous question.</p>

<p>Dependent children refers to individuals aged 0-17 years and 18-24 years if inactive and living with at least one parent.</p>

<h4>What is the person’s ethnicity?</h4>
<p>Please select from the options on the drop down list. This list includes the option *Participant Chose not to say.<br>

<h4>Is the person homeless?</h4>
<p>Yes/No/*Participant Chose not to say.<br>
*Where possible, please encourage an answer to this question rather than the participant chose not to say.</p>

<p>A person will be classed as being legally homeless if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have no home in the UK or anywhere else in the world</li>
  <li>have no home where they can live together with their immediate family</li>
  <li>can only stay where they are on a very temporary basis</li>
  <li>do not have permission to live where they are</li>
  <li>have been locked out of their home and are not allowed back</li>
  <li>cannot live at home because of violence or abuse or threats of violence or abuse which are likely to be carried out against them or someone else in their household</li>
  <li>it is not reasonable for them to stay in their home for any reason, for example, their home is in very poor condition</li>
  <li>cannot afford to stay where they are</li>
</ul>

<p>People who are rough sleepers should also be counted as being homeless. The definition of rough sleepers is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people sleeping, about to bed down (sitting on/in or standing next to their bedding) or actually bedded down in the open air (such as on the streets, in tents, doorways, parks, bus shelters or encampments)</li>
  <li>people in buildings or other places not designed for habitation (such as stairwells, barns, sheds, car parks, cars, derelict boats, stations, or ‘bashes’)</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition does not include people in hostels or shelters, people in campsites or other sites used for recreational purposes or organised protest, squatters or travelers. Bedded down is taken to mean either lying down or sleeping. About to bed down includes those who are sitting in/on or near a sleeping bag or other bedding.</p>

<p>Note, when completing the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 1420 form for a homeless participant, you must note the participant address postcode as ‘HS99 9ZZ’, this is needed as part of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> reporting process. As the form also needs an address completing, you can use the Jobcentre Plus address (but not the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> postcode). We will update the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Provider Guidance with this information.</p>

<h3>Initial Data Gather Part 3: Participant Eligibility</h3>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-2014-to-2020-provider-guidance/chapter-3-participant-identification-eligibility-and-referral">Provider Guidance chapter 3</a> for details of eligibility and eligibility evidence requirements.</p>

<p>There are 4 questions in this section.</p>

<p>Each section has a maximum of 150 characters allowing providers to state the relevant eligibility criteria and categories along with the type of evidence seen and retained. The detailed information and evidence to support the participant’s eligibility will be gathered separately ie on a participant self-declaration which is retained by the provider.  The questions are:</p>

<h4>Please detail in the space provided what evidence you have seen and retained to confirm the individual named in Part 1 is legally resident, has the right to take paid employment in the UK and is aged over 16.</h4>

<p>Include here the type of document you have seen to check the customer’s identity and confirm whether you have kept the reference or serial number of the documents seen.  You are not required to state the actual reference/serial numbers on this form.</p>

<h4>Please detail in the space provided what evidence you have seen and retained to confirm the individual named in Part 1 is unemployed or inactive.</h4>

<p>For the unemployed status you should note any evidence you have seen and retained but in addition <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will confirm the unemployed status by checking <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems.</p>

<h4>Please detail in the space provided the eligibility category (as detailed in provider guidance) for which the individual named in Part 1 is being referred.</h4>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area uses the narrow and wider eligibility criteria please state which of these 2 apply. The European Commission requires reporting for both narrow and wider eligibilities so the providers need to separate these out on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 14/20 returns. Note, where the referred participants fall into both eligibilities please state the narrower one as this is still a key target group for the provision.</p>

<p>Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-2014-to-2020-provider-guidance/annex-1-contract-package-area-specific-information">Annex 1 Contract Package Area specific information</a> in the provider guidance.</p>

<p>For the ‘long-term’ criteria please state if this is a period of unemployment, inactivity or a combination of the two.</p>

<p>Where there are combined periods of unemployment and inactive periods to make the 26 week long-term period you must confirm here that you have retained a self declaration to support that the participant was either inactive or unemployed throughout the 26 week period. Where known, you should detail the period of unemployment for the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Admin Team to confirm.</p>

<p>Where the participant has more than one barrier to work, each barrier must be noted here.</p>

<h4>Please detail in the space provided below what evidence you have seen and retained to confirm eligibility, including a self-declaration (where appropriate).</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will confirm any periods of unemployment or any qualifying benefits if appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not keep copies of passports, driving licences, birth certificates or identity cards. All other evidence should be copied and retained as per paragraph 3.33 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-2014-to-2020-provider-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014 to 2020 provider guidance</a>.</p>
