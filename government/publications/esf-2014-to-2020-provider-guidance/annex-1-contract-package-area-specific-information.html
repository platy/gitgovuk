<p>A1.4 The ultimate aim of the provision is for sustained employment outcomes to be attained - preferably within the key employment sectors in the D2N2 area which will support economic growth and prosperity.</p>

<h3>Eligibility for this Provision</h3>

<p>A1.5 As of December 2017 the wider eligibility comes into force for D2N2 as detailed as chapter 3 section 3.8-3.10. It is crucial the provider still target the narrow eligibility at A1.6 to 1.7 below to ensure the original contract requirement is being met but you should now supplement this with the wider referral base.</p>

<p>A1.6 To be eligible for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, all participants must be legally resident and have the right to take paid employment in the UK. Participants must be aged 16 or over. There is no upper age limit for participants.</p>

<p>A1.8 You have been advised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to widen the eligibility criteria from December 2017. Participants from the eligibility groups in Chapter 3 can now also be recruited onto your provision. See the paragraph below for information on the (Minimum Performance Levels (<abbr title="Minimum Performance Level">MPL</abbr>) for the Wider Eligibility Groups).</p>

<h3>Activities to Support the Provision</h3>

<p>A1.9 The key to the success of the provision that you will deliver will be the role of your Personal Mentors. They will use their mentoring and advocacy skills to gain the trust of participants and give them practical, professional advice tailored to meet their individual needs and personal circumstances. Your Personal Mentors must have knowledge of employment issues, the local labour market and local training provision.</p>

<p>A1.10 The provision itself consists of 2 distinct stages. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: ‘Engage and Inspire’</li>
  <li>Stage 2: ‘Support on the Pathway to Work’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stage 1: ‘Engage and Inspire’</h3>

<p>A1.11 You will deliver a motivational course at the start of the provision to participants which will usually be for 15 hours a week for two weeks. The ‘Engage and Inspire’ course is the Gateway to the provision. Delivered as a group session, ‘Engage and Inspire’ will challenge the way that people think and behave. It must address motivation and confidence issues and inspire
participants and raise their aspirations. The course, which you will design and deliver, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Energise, enthuse and instil self-belief and aspiration</li>
  <li>Teach positive thinking and the skills to achieve that mind-set</li>
  <li>Empower participants to succeed</li>
  <li>Challenge negativity and low self-esteem and other barriers to employment (real and psychological) and help participants to overcome them</li>
  <li>Develop long term improved positive attitudes towards life and work, and</li>
  <li>Deliver and emphasise the message that ‘work pays’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stage 2: ‘Support on the Pathway to Work’</h3>

<p>A1.12 Having completed Stage 1 ‘Engage and Inspire’, your Personal Mentor will meet with the participant and conduct a comprehensive and holistic diagnostic assessment of their needs. This will lead to the Action Plan being updated with the inclusion of the ‘Pathway to Work’ that is agreed between Personal Mentor and participant.</p>

<p>A1.13 The support provided by the Personal Mentor on the ‘Pathway to Work’ must include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentoring and advocacy</li>
  <li>Motivation and confidence building</li>
  <li>Unlocking the potential in each individual</li>
  <li>Identifying and addressing particular barriers to work – such as childcare and travel</li>
  <li>The identification of transferrable skills</li>
  <li>Jobseeking advice and support, applying for work online and other work search activities</li>
  <li>Reviewing the existing <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> of each participant and updating it if necessary. If a participant does not have a <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> one must be created. Each participant on the provision must have a comprehensive <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> that will be an asset to them in their quest to find employment</li>
  <li>Practical soft skills training such as interview techniques and presenting oneself to a prospective employer (which will include undertaking mock interviews)</li>
  <li>Advice on staying in work once it has been attained</li>
  <li>Discussing and promoting the merits of work experience, work trials, work tasters and volunteering. You will be expected to broker these opportunities as part of your employer engagement activities</li>
  <li>Practical work skills specific to and in partnership with local employers</li>
  <li>Discussing self-employment options and where necessary signposting to New Enterprise Allowance and local enterprise start-up programmes</li>
</ul>

<p>A1.14 The support that you will deliver on the ‘Pathway to Work’ stage will predominantly be one to one with the participant. However, when it is most appropriate and beneficial to the participant, group sessions may be delivered.</p>

<p>A1.15 Signposting to local specialist support may be appropriate for some barriers that will need to be addressed where a level of expertise will be required.
Examples might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Financial management and budgeting advice</li>
  <li>Access to childcare and care for dependents</li>
  <li>Housing issues</li>
  <li>Dependency issues</li>
</ul>

<p>A1.16 Signposting will also be appropriate when a participant would benefit from additional support available as existing provision. Examples might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Careers advice from the National Careers Service</li>
  <li>Community learning</li>
  <li>Skills for Life including literacy and numeracy</li>
  <li>Vocational and workplace skills training</li>
  <li>Training at educational establishments including provision funded through the Adult Skills Budget</li>
  <li>Other Skills Funded Agency provision including pre- employment training such as Sector Based Academies</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision</li>
  <li>Any other provision that meets the needs of the individual</li>
</ul>

<p>A1.17 If a participant has a potential job to start but requires quick, low cost training or job related certification to be able to start work, you will be expected to fund that. Typical examples might include Food Hygiene, Manual Handing, <abbr title="Security Industry Authority">SIA</abbr> and, <abbr title="Construction Skills Certification Scheme">CSCS</abbr> courses/certification for example. This will only be applicable where the absence of that certification is identified as the barrier preventing individuals from moving into work, where a real and current job opportunity is available for the individual and the certificate is at the request of the employer.</p>

<p>A1.18 You must also help the personal development of participants and help them to become more independent by reducing any sense of isolation and stress that they may feel. Examples of this might include addressing rural transport issues through developing individual confidence with public transport and/or accompanying a participant when accessing other services when it is appropriate.</p>

<p>A1.19 The ‘Pathway to Work’ activities described are not exhaustive. They will vary by location and will be determined by and tailored to individual need. They will also evolve throughout the life of the contract and be flexible to meet the changing nature of the local economy and labour market.</p>

<h3>Minimum Performance Levels – Wider Eligibility Groups</h3>

<p>A1.20 The following additional Minimum Performance Levels will apply if you are advised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to extend the participant eligibility criteria to include the eligibility groups in Chapter 3 and will be in addition to <abbr title="Minimum Performance Levels">MPLs</abbr> 1 to 8 in Annex 9.</p>

<p>A1.21 The providers specified percentage increase that will be applied to each Short Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate in relation to the Wider Eligibility Groups shall be a Minimum Performance Level. Short Job Outcome Cohort conversion rates and Cohort Profile will remain the same as submitted by the Provider for MPL6.</p>

<p>A1.22 The providers specified percentage increase that will be applied to each Sustained Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate in relation to the Wider Eligibility Groups shall be a Minimum Performance Level. Sustained Job Outcome Cohort conversion rates and Cohort Profile will remain the same as submitted by the Provider for MPL7.</p>

<h3>Performance relating to eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>A1.23 You will be performance managed against the Minimum Performance  Level number 3, ‘as a minimum the number of provision starts will never be below 85% of the cumulative starts profile’ (See Annex 9). This will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the contract, for the eligibility criteria stated above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.24 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review performance against starts from the specific groups identified above. This will be undertaken on a monthly basis, looking at the previous rolling six months of performance. If the performance is below 70% of Profile for starts within any six month period, this will be the trigger point for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to consider widening eligibility to include eligibility groups set out in Chapter 3. This will be done in consultation with the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reserve the right to extend eligibility.</p>

<h3>Eligibility criteria extended to additional groups in Chapter 3</h3>

<p>A1.25 If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> exercises its right to extend the eligibility criteria to include the eligibility groups set out in Chapter 3, you will be required to include the percentage of additional Short and Sustained Job Outcomes achievement from starts for these additional eligibility groups. This additional percentage will be applied to each Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate with Cohort Profiles remaining the same.</p>

<p>A1.26 You will not be asked to achieve specific volumes of starts in relation to the additional eligibility groups; rather the performance measurement in relation to these groups will focus on the conversion of starts to outcomes. For example, if a Provider’s tender shows they will achieve a 20% conversion of starts into Sustained Job Outcomes for each Cohort conversion rate for the eligibility groups above and show that by opening up the provision to include the additional eligibility groups they will increase outcomes by a further 2 percentage points, then for each Cohort <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect a 22% outcome conversion rate. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this metric of additional outcomes achieved as the performance management tool for these additional eligibility groups. This will be a separate and additional performance metric to that being used to deliver the provision requirements in respect of the groups above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.27 You will be managed against the Minimum Performance Levels for both sets of eligibility criteria (eligibility criteria above for this provision and the additional eligibility groups in Chapter 3), i.e. Minimum Performance Levels numbered 6 (Annex 9) and 9 (above) in relation to Short Job Outcomes and those numbered 7 (Annex 9) and 10 (above) in relation to Sustained Job Outcomes. If either is not achieved, Performance Improvement Notices may be issued. If improvements are not realised then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may terminate the contract. Not only does this impact on this particular contract, but it may also be taken in to account if you submit tenders for any future public contracts.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>This menu is not exhaustive, and will vary across locations according to participant need.</p>

<h3>Business Engagement</h3>

<p>A1.8 You are expected to engage with local businesses to encourage them to offer placements and sustainable jobs to unemployed people. There must be a clear link to maximise the employment opportunities that will be created through the Business Growth plans in European Structural and Investment Fund/Regional Growth Fund to maximise the opportunities through job creation.</p>

<h3>Minimum Performance Levels – Wider Eligibility Groups</h3>

<p>A1.9	The following additional Minimum Performance Levels will apply if you are advised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to extend the participant eligibility criteria to include the eligibility groups in Chapter 3 and will be in addition to those in Annex 9.</p>

<p>A1.10 The providers specified percentage increase that will be applied to each Short Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate in relation to the Wider Eligibility Groups shall be a Minimum Performance Level. Short Job Outcome Cohort conversion rates and Cohort Profile will remain the same as submitted by the Provider for MPL6.</p>

<p>A1.11 The providers specified percentage increase that will be applied to each Sustained Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate in relation to the Wider Eligibility Groups shall be a Minimum Performance Level. Sustained Job Outcome Cohort conversion rates and Cohort Profile will remain the same as submitted by the Provider for MPL7.</p>

<h3>Performance relating to eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>A1.12 You will be performance managed against the Minimum Performance Level number 3, ‘as a minimum the number of provision starts will never be below 85% of the cumulative starts profile’ (See Annex 9). This will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the contract, for the eligibility criteria stated above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.13 After an initial [six] month period <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review performance against starts from the specific groups identified above. This will subsequently be undertaken on a monthly basis after the initial review, looking at the previous rolling six months of performance. If the performance is below [70%] of Profile for starts within any six month period including at or after the initial review, this will be the trigger point for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to consider widening eligibility to include eligibility groups set out in Chapter 3. This will be done in consultation with the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reserve the right to extend eligibility.</p>

<h3>Eligibility criteria extended to additional groups in Chapter 3</h3>

<p>A1.14 If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> exercises its right to extend the eligibility criteria to include the eligibility groups set out in Chapter 3, you will be required to include the percentage of additional Short and Sustained Job Outcomes achievement from starts for these additional eligibility groups. This additional percentage will be applied to each Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate with Cohort Profiles remaining the same.</p>

<p>A1.15 You will not be asked to achieve specific volumes of starts in relation to the additional eligibility groups; rather the performance measurement in relation to these groups will focus on the conversion of starts to outcomes. For example, if a Provider’s tender shows they will achieve a 20% conversion of starts into Sustained Job Outcomes for each Cohort conversion rate for the eligibility groups above and show that by opening up the provision to include the additional eligibility groups they will increase outcomes by a further 2 percentage points, then for each Cohort <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect a 22% outcome conversion rate. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this metric of additional outcomes achieved as the performance management tool for these additional eligibility groups. This will be a separate and additional performance metric to that being used to deliver the provision requirements in respect of the groups above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.16 You will be managed against the Minimum Performance Levels for both sets of eligibility criteria (eligibility criteria above for this provision and the additional eligibility groups in Chapter 3), i.e. Minimum Performance Levels numbered 6 (Annex 9) and A1.9 (above) in relation to Short Job Outcomes and those numbered 7 (Annex 9) and A1.10 (above) in relation to Sustained Job Outcomes. If either is not achieved, Performance Improvement Notices may be issued. If improvements are not realised then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may terminate the contract. Not only does this impact on this particular contract, but it may also be taken in to account if you submit tenders for any future public contracts.</p>

Contract Package Area<br></p>

<h3>Aims and Objective of the Provision</h3>

<p>A1.1	This provision is voluntary and will help those furthest from the labour market to find sustained employment by providing them with intensive support tailored to individual participant need. It will engage with economically inactive people that are not claiming benefits and benefit claimants with complex needs. Participants must be aged 25 or over on their official start date.</p>

<p>A1.2	Whilst the provision must be participant led and looking after the employment aspirations of each participant, you will be expected to make links and form strong working relationships with employers in local growth sectors. Ultimately such relationships will enhance the chances of provision participants finding work.</p>

<p>A1.3 The ultimate objective of the provision is to achieve sustained employment outcomes. You will provide In-Work Support to those that require it and this will enhance the likelihood of work sustainability being achieved.</p>

<h3>Activities to Support the Provision</h3>

<p>A1.4	The priority groups that the provision is aimed at are the hardest to help.
Many will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be significantly disadvantaged and vulnerable</li>
  <li>Have complex needs and several barriers to work</li>
  <li>Be disengaged</li>
  <li>Have previously been resistant to engagement, and</li>
  <li>Be outside of the labour market</li>
</ul>

<p>A1.5	Whilst the provision is voluntary and support will always be tailored to individual need, it is anticipated that you will need to invest a significant amount of time in participants. The complexity and severity of the barriers to work faced by most participants will require intensive support from you in order for job outcomes to be achieved. This intensity of support and your investment will equate to an extension of the existing offer for the unemployed.</p>

<p>A1.6	You must deliver an intensive and enhanced Information Advice and  Guidance (<abbr title="Information Advice and  Guidance">IAG</abbr>) service alongside practical interventions. The in-depth service that you provide will be delivered by Case Workers who will ensure that added value is achieved. As a minimum the service must consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentoring and advocacy</li>
  <li>Confidence building</li>
  <li>Raising aspirations</li>
  <li>Exploring realistic training and career opportunities</li>
  <li>The creation of an up to date <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> for each participant</li>
  <li>Digital awareness and digital inclusion (incorporating looking for work online)</li>
  <li>Helping participants to look for and apply for work</li>
  <li>Assistance with application form completion</li>
  <li>Interview skills training (including undertaking mock interviews and how to present oneself to a prospective employer)</li>
  <li>Brokering supported work experience and volunteering opportunities with local employers and organisations and arranging participant attendance on these opportunities</li>
  <li>Access to mentors from local companies. (This might also include enlisting peer mentors from former provision participants that have successfully gained employment)</li>
  <li>Promoting self-employment and, where appropriate, signposting to New Enterprise Allowance and other local entrepreneurial provision</li>
  <li>Encouraging part time work, breaking down negative stereotypes about it and explaining how Universal Credit ensures that ‘Work Pays’</li>
  <li>Addressing childcare or transport concerns where they represent (or are perceived by the participant to represent) the main barrier to work, and</li>
  <li>Researching and signposting participants to the most appropriate provision given their individual circumstances</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bespoke Employability Training</h3>

<p>A1.7 Short bespoke employability training may be required when barriers to work have been identified that need to be overcome and the courses themselves do not already exist locally or as national mainstream provision. You will be expected to deliver these courses. ‘Healthy Living’, ‘Managing Personal Finances’ or ‘Health and Safety’ are examples of the type of bespoke courses which might need to be run. (Where such courses do already exist, signposting participants to them is the appropriate action, the cost of attendance being met by you).</p>

<p>A1.8	Whilst the provision will principally be delivered on a one to one basis by a Case Worker, these bespoke courses may be run as group sessions.</p>

<h3>Additional Support for those with Complex Barriers</h3>

<p>A1.9	For those with the most severe needs, even more intensive support will need to be provided to address their barriers. In addition to the support already listed above, participants may also benefit from signposting to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specialist help with complex barriers (for example, housing, drug and alcohol misuse, mental health etc)</li>
  <li>Information and Communication Technology (<abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>) support (for example accessing and using assistive technology which will increase, maintain, or improve the <abbr title="information technology">IT</abbr> capabilities of participants with disabilities for day to day living and social interaction)</li>
  <li>Literacy, numeracy, and English for Speakers of Other Languages (<abbr title="English for speakers of other languages">ESOL</abbr>) provision including pre-entry level <abbr title="English for speakers of other languages">ESOL</abbr> support, and</li>
  <li>Bespoke vocational training</li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Groups</h3>

<p>A1.10 The <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> has requested you target the following groups as a priority, but not exclusively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People with no qualifications. (i.e. persons with no formal qualifications attained from education or working in any business sector. This group is likely to have poor numeracy and literacy skills)</li>
  <li>Women returners to the labour market. (i.e. those who have not worked in the 12 months prior to starting the provision)</li>
  <li>Those with learning difficulties and / or disabilities</li>

<p>A1.6	You will need to be aware of all of the ‘free at the point of use’ <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> services available and those offered by community and voluntary sector organisations for your signposting to occur. For example, participants might benefit from:</p>

  <li>Cognitive behavioural therapy</li>
  <li>Neuro-linguistic programming, and / or</li>
  <li>Counselling</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These options are not exhaustive, and will vary across locations according to participant needs.</p>

<h3>Employer Engagement</h3>

<p>A1.10 You are expected to engage with local businesses to encourage them to offer placements and sustainable jobs to unemployed people. You are expected to advocate the benefits of employing older workers and should work to broker more flexible employment opportunities such as part time work.</p>

<h3>Integration with Local Services</h3>

<p>A1.11 You are expected to build sustainable partnerships with existing local provision and organisations that are active in offering support to unemployed people, especially those aged over 50. Integration with local services should aim to join up the support offered to participant’s based on the needs identified through the assessment and action planning process. It is expected integration will span the public (especially Local Authorities), private, health, voluntary and community sectors and further education institutions.</p>

<h3>Minimum Performance Levels – Wider Eligibility Groups</h3>

<p>A1.12 The following additional Minimum Performance Levels will apply if you are advised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to extend the participant eligibility criteria to include the eligibility groups in Para A1.7 and will be in addition to <abbr title="Minimum Performance Levels">MPLs</abbr> 1 to 8 in Annex 9.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>9: The providers specified percentage increase that will be applied to each Short Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate in relation to the Wider Eligibility Groups shall be a Minimum Performance Level. Short Job Outcome Cohort conversion rates and Cohort Profile will remain the same as submitted by the Provider for MPL6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>10: The providers specified percentage increase that will be applied to each Sustained Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate in relation to the Wider Eligibility Groups shall be a Minimum Performance Level. Sustained Job Outcome Cohort conversion rates and Cohort Profile will remain the same as submitted by the Provider for MPL7.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance relating to eligibility criteria</h3>

<p>A1.13 You will be performance managed against the Minimum Performance Level number 3, ‘as a minimum the number of provision starts will never be below 85% of the cumulative starts profile’ (See Annex 9). This will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the contract, for the eligibility criteria stated at Para A1.5 above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.14 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review performance against starts from the specific groups identified in the eligibility criteria at Para A1.5 above. This will be undertaken on a monthly basis, looking at the previous rolling six months of performance. If the performance is below [70%] of Profile for starts within any six month period, this will be the trigger point for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to consider widening eligibility to include eligibility groups set out at Para A1.7. This will be done in consultation with the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reserve the right to extend eligibility.</p>

<h3>Eligibility criteria extended to additional groups in Para A1.7</h3>

<p>A1.15 If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> exercises its right to extend the eligibility criteria in accordance with Para A1.7 to include Wider Eligibility Groups, you will be required to include the percentage of additional Short and Sustained Job Outcomes achievement from starts for the Wider Eligibility Groups. This additional percentage will be applied to each Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate with Cohort Profiles remaining the same.</p>

<p>A1.16 You will not be asked to achieve specific volumes of starts in relation to the additional eligibility groups; rather the performance measurement in relation to these groups will focus on the conversion of starts to outcomes. For example, if a Provider’s tender shows they will achieve a 20% conversion of starts into Sustained Job Outcomes for each Cohort conversion rate for the eligibility groups above and show that by opening up the provision to include the additional eligibility groups they will increase outcomes by a further 2 percentage points, then for each Cohort <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect a 22% outcome conversion rate. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this metric of additional outcomes achieved as the performance management tool for these additional eligibility groups. This will be a separate and additional performance metric to that being used to deliver the provision requirements in respect of the eligibility groups set out at Para A1.5 for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.17 You will be managed against the Minimum Performance Levels for both sets of eligibility criteria (eligibility criteria at Para A1.5 for this provision and the additional eligibility groups at Para A1.7), i.e. Minimum Performance Levels numbered 6 (Annex 9) and 9 (above) in relation to Short Job Outcomes and those numbered 7 (Annex 9) and 10 (above) in relation to Sustained Job Outcomes. If either is not achieved, Performance Improvement Notices may be issued. If improvements are not realised then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may terminate the contract. Not only does this impact on this particular contract, but it may also be taken in to account if you submit tenders for any future public contracts.</p>

<h3>Change of Address and transfer to other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 Employment Support for Older Workers in London</h3>

<p>A1.18 This information should be read in conjunction with Chapter 5.</p>

<p>A1.19 Participants who change address during the provision period, such that they reside outside of the London <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> Area, can choose to change to another <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 provision outside London if they are eligible.</p>

<p>A1.20 If a participant changes address during the provision period and moves outside the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> but stays within the London <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area, it will not be permissible for them to move from one <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Employment Support for Older Workers contract to another. They will however be able to move to other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014–2020 provision if it has a different focus or is outside the London <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area.</p>

<p>A1.21 Once a participant has completed provision, including early completion, they can only access <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 provision if it is outside the London <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area or has a different focus.</p>

<h3>London Employability Performance Rating</h3>

<p>A1.22 You are required to participate in the Greater London Authority’s (<abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>) London Employability Performance Rating (<abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr>), which uses management and performance information, supports participant choice and collects evidence of customer satisfaction. The London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> provides an evidence- based track record of delivery against contract, improves transparency of performance management and provides a framework for lead providers to performance manage themselves and sub-contractors.</p>

<p>A1.23 Participation in the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> is in addition to and can form part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Performance Management Regime described in Annex 9.</p>

<p>A1.24 The London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> system is a tool to benchmark the achievements of employability service providers in <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>. The London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> awards a performance rating based on three key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contract Delivery Performance</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Compliance</li>
</ul>

<p>A1.25 Contract Delivery Performance - Performance Scoring will be taken from published short and sustained job outcomes. 60% of the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> total score is weighted on performance.</p>

<p>A1.26 Quality - This assessment criteria will call on your knowledge and awareness of the quality of the provision, continuous improvement and participant satisfaction. You will be expected to complete a self-assessment questionnaire and participant satisfaction surveys. 30% of the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> total score is weighted on quality. A1.26 Compliance – This includes timeliness of claims returns; variance of claim forecasts; accuracy of returns and general adherence to customer service levels. 10% of the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> total score is weighted on compliance.</p>

<p>A1.27 Further information about the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> and your role in the process can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://data.london.gov.uk/london-%20employability-performance-rating/" rel="external"><abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>’s website</a>.
This website includes the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> Provider guidance which gives a detailed process of your role in capturing and reporting against the required performance, quality and compliance scores.</p>

<p>A1.28 To ensure you have the right understanding of these products and can apply your learning to the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> tool you should refer to the guidance on the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> website. The <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will work together to provide further support where necessary.</p>

<p>A1.29 You are required to undertake the initial phase of the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> assessment using the calculation tool accessible in the hyperlink above. The information that you enter into the tool will generate a series of scores. These scores will be transposed into a star rating.</p>

<p>A1.30 It is a requirement of London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> that you also undertake a separate rating of your sub-contractors. You will also need to report your sub-contractor star rating to your Performance Manager (<abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>).</p>

<p>A1.31 You must complete the London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> calculation tool on a yearly basis throughout the lifetime of the contract and submit to your <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> by 10th working day of April.</p>

<p>A1.32 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will conduct checks to verify the information you provide. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will liaise with you if there are any discrepancies before the ratings are issued to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> for publication. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will submit the agreed London <abbr title="Employability Performance Rating">EPR</abbr> to the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> during May each year to ensure they are published in time for the annual summer release.</p>

<p>A1.33 Provider ratings will be published by the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr> on a yearly basis.</p>

This will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the contract, for the eligibility criteria stated above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.18 After an initial [six] month period <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review performance against starts from the specific groups identified above. This will subsequently be undertaken on a monthly basis after the initial review, looking at the previous rolling six months of performance. If the performance is below [70%] of Profile for starts within any six month period including at or after the initial review, this will be the trigger point for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to consider widening eligibility to include eligibility groups set out in Chapter 3. This will be done in consultation with the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reserve the right to extend eligibility.</p>

<h3>Eligibility criteria extended to additional groups in Chapter 3</h3>

<p>A1.19 If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> exercises its right to extend the eligibility criteria to include the eligibility groups set out in Chapter 3, you will be required to include the percentage of additional Short and Sustained Job Outcomes achievement from starts for these additional eligibility groups. This additional percentage will be applied to each Job Outcome Cohort conversion rate with Cohort Profiles remaining the same.</p>

<p>A1.20 You will not be asked to achieve specific volumes of starts in relation to the additional eligibility groups; rather the performance measurement in relation to these groups will focus on the conversion of starts to outcomes. For example, if a Provider’s tender shows they will achieve a 20% conversion of starts into Sustained Job Outcomes for each Cohort conversion rate for the eligibility groups above and show that by opening up the provision to include the additional eligibility groups they will increase outcomes by a further 2 percentage points, then for each Cohort <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect a 22% outcome conversion rate. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this metric of additional outcomes achieved as the performance management tool for these additional eligibility groups. This will be a separate and additional performance metric to that being used to deliver the Provision requirements in respect of the groups above for this provision.</p>

<p>A1.21 You will be managed against the Minimum Performance Levels for both sets of eligibility criteria (eligibility criteria above for this provision and the additional eligibility groups in Chapter 3), i.e. Minimum Performance Levels numbered 6 (Annex 9) and 9 (above) in relation to Short Job Outcomes and those numbered 7 (Annex 9) and 10 (above) in relation to Sustained Job Outcomes. If either is not achieved, Performance Improvement Notices may be issued. If improvements are not realised then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may terminate the contract. Not only does this impact on this particular contract, but it may also be taken in to account if you submit tenders for any future public contracts.</p>
