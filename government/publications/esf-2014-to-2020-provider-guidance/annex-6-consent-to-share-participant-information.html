<p>[Name of provider] is working with Jobcentre Plus programme participants on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr>) to help these participants to increase their skills to help them find and keep work. [provider] may claim a payment from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> for every participant who finds work while or after participating in a programme.</p>

<p>To claim a payment from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> [provider] may need to confirm details of your employment.</p>

<p>To validate these claims <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> may need to confirm details of your employment. Where appropriate, this may involve confirming details with each of your employers.</p>

<p>To achieve this, [provider], <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> and your future employers need your consent to share information about you as follows:</p>

<p>Stage 1: [Provider] will give your name and national insurance number to your future employer.</p>

<p>Stage 2: Your employers will use your name and national insurance number to identify you, so that they can confirm to [provider] some or all of the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date you began each period of your employment;</li>
  <li>whether your employment is continuing;</li>
  <li>if not continuing, the date each period of your employment ended;</li>
  <li>whether you were employed during a specific period;</li>
  <li>the number of hours you worked each week;</li>
  <li>the amount of your earnings each week;</li>
  <li>your employee number or other unique identifier. This information can only be provided where company payroll/structures exist, and therefore if no payroll numbers or detail is present, this information cannot be supplied</li>
</ul>

<p>Stage 3: To validate payment claims from [provider], <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> may contact your employer using your name and national insurance number to ask for the information listed at stage 2. It will use this information to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check if the information given to it by the [provider] is correct; and</li>
  <li>evaluate the programme</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> will store your information securely for audit purposes.</p>

<p>If you do not give consent, this will not affect your entitlement to participate in the programme, or any job offer or employment obtained. You can write to [provider] at any time to withdraw your consent and this will not affect your placement on the programme or any employment or offer of employment made.</p>

<p>Participant name (Please print name in full)</p>

<p>I give consent for [provider], my future employer and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)">DWP</abbr> to share information as described in stages 1 to 3 above. 
I confirm that:</p>

<p>I have read the information above and understand why this information sharing is needed and how this information will be used.</p>

<p>I understand that:</p>

<p>If I am in receipt of any benefits, my entitlement to these benefits will not depend on whether I choose to give consent or not. 
My placement on any programme with [provider] and any employment or future offer of employment will not depend on whether I choose to give consent or not. 
I can withdraw my consent at any time by writing to [provider]</p>
