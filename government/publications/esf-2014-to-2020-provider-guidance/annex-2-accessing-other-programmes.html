<p>Where the participant leaves JSA and remains self- employed you can claim a Job Outcome provided it is within the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> tracking period and meets the definition of a Job Outcome.</p>

<h3>Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Where a participant is on your provision already the Jobcentre Plus work coach will determine their proximity to the labour market at that point, before considering a referral to sbwa. sbwa placements last for up to 6 weeks, and are for individuals who are closer to the labour market.</p>

If they have participated in your provision, the job is within the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> tracking period and meets the definition of a Job Outcome; you are able to claim a Job Outcome.</p>

Both providers are assured that   participation in both adds value to their respective provisions and action   plans are noted to evidence this.    <br>3.Both providers   can evidence that the provision adds value and does not duplicate.    Where the participant   moves into paid employment, job outcomes could be claimed by both the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>   provider and other provisions if they have both supported the customer in   their journey into employment the job outcome adheres to the relevant   contractual and provider guidance definition as per normal business.<br>    <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> cannot comment further for other organisations and providers so they will have to ensure   themselves that dual participation is acceptable.</td>
