<h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>

<h3>Action Plan</h3>
<p>A document that specifies agreed activity.</p>

<h3>BravoSolution</h3>
<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> eProcurement Solution. This website provides a suite of collaborative web-based tools that enable procurement professionals and suppliers to conduct the strategic activities of the procurement cycle over the internet.</p>

<h3>Category of Region</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations governing use of the funds in 2014-2020 define three different categories of ‘region’ in Europe:</p>

<p>Less developed regions - areas (as defined at Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics(NUTs)  2 level, which equates approximately to large counties, groups of smaller counties and some cities) with a Gross Domestic Product (<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr>)  per capita below 75% of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> average.</p>

<p>These areas would receive a higher level of structural funds, will have more headroom to fund activities outside of the four top priorities for <abbr title="European Regional Development Fund">ERDF</abbr> and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, and will need to find less matched funding (the structural funds can form up to 80% of eligible costs in the 2014-2020 period). The only area in England expected to fall into this category is Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.</p>

<p>75% and 90% of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> average. Transition regions would receive a slightly higher than average intensity of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> but this funding would have to be more heavily concentrated on selected activities than in less developed regions. Projects can be financed at a maximum rate of 60% for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Places within this category in England include: Devon, Lincolnshire, East Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire, Shropshire &amp; Staffordshire, South Yorkshire, Merseyside, Lancashire, Tees Valley &amp; Durham and Cumbria.</p>

<p>More developed regions - areas with a <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> per capita above 90% of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> average. Most parts of England fall into this category. Projects are financed at a maximum rate of 50% for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>
