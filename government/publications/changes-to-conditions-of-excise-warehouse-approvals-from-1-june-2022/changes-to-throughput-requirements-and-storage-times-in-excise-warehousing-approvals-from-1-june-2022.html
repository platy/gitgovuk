<h2>For the attention of approved excise warehousekeepers and users</h2>

<p>You should read this document if you are the approved warehousekeeper of, or hold excise goods in, any excise warehouse approved under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 or section 15 Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979. This page contains variations to conditions of warehouse approvals.</p>

<h2>Distiller’s warehouse approval variation</h2>

<p>This section has force of law.</p>

<p>This variation applies to all distiller’s warehouses which were approved prior to 1 June 2022, and which continue to be approved on this date.</p>

<p>With effect from the 1 June 2022 the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, under section 15 Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979, vary the condition in distiller’s warehouse approvals that specifies how long goods can remain in the warehouse, following the completion of the operation (including maturation) for which they were originally entered for, as follows:</p>

<p>Warehousekeepers may in any distiller’s warehouse they occupy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store their own goods indefinitely</li>
  <li>store spirit produced at the facility to which the warehouse is linked, owned by a third party for a period of 90 days following the completion of the operation (including maturation) they were entered into the warehouse for</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trade facility warehouse approval variation</h2>

<p>This section has force of law.</p>

<p>This variation applies to all trade facility warehouses which were approved prior to 1 June 2022 and which continue to be approved on this date.</p>

<p>With effect from 1 June 2022 the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, vary the condition in excise trade facility warehouse approvals that specifies how long goods can remain in the warehouse following completion of the operation for which they were originally entered for, as follows:</p>

<p>From 1 June 2022 warehousekeepers may in any trade facility warehouse they occupy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store their own goods indefinitely</li>
  <li>store goods owned by a third party for a period of 90 days, following the completion of the operation they were entered into the warehouse for</li>
</ul>

<h2>General storage and distribution warehouse approval variation</h2>

<p>This section has force of law.</p>

<p>This variation applies to all general storage and distribution warehouses which were approved prior to 1 June 2022, and which continue to be approved on this date.</p>

<p>With effect from 1 June 2022 the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, under section 92 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, vary the terms in all general storage and distribution warehouse approvals that specifies a minimum throughput level, as follows:</p>

<p>The requirements for both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a minimum potential duty liability of £500,000 on the average monthly stockholding of duty-suspended excise goods</li>
  <li>a duty liability of at least £2 million on an annual throughput of duty-suspended excise goods</li>
</ul>

<p>are revoked. This means there is no longer a minimum throughput level on general storage and distribution warehouses that meet this criteria.</p>

<h2>General storage and distribution warehouse approval — notice of amendment of Excise Notice 196</h2>

<p>This is a notification of change. The change applies to all general storage and distribution warehouses which were approved prior to 1 June 2022, and which continue to be approved on this date.</p>

<p>With effect from 1 June 2022, paragraph 4.1 of Excise Notice 196 (Registration and approval of excise goods held in duty suspension) will be amended. This change will be made in Excise Notice 196 itself.</p>

<p>The amendment of Notice 196, paragraph 4.1 removes the requirements to comply with the minimum throughput levels.</p>

<p>Specifically, there is no longer a requirement to have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a minimum potential duty liability of £500,000 on the average monthly stockholding of duty-suspended excise goods</li>
  <li>a duty liability of at least £2 million on an annual throughput of duty-suspended excise goods</li>
</ul>

<p>to be considered for approval as a general storage and distribution warehouse.</p>
