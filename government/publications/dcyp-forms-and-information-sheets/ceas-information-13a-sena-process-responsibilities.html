<h2>Aim of <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>1.	The aim of Continuity of Education Allowance (Special Educational Needs Addition) 	(<abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>)) is to contribute towards the additional costs associated with a specific 	support plan for an individual service child who has a level of Special Educational Needs 	(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr>) which cannot reasonably be met within the expected resources of a school.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>2.	Before making an application for <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>, please consider very carefully whether the 	child/young person has special educational needs.  For the purposes of <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>, <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> is defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A child or young person has <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> if they have a learning difficulty or disability which 		calls for special education provision to be made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A child of compulsory school age or a young person has a learning difficulty or 			disability if they have a significant greater difficulty in learning than the majority of 		others 	of the same age; or who have a disability which prevents or hinders them 			from making use of facilities of a kind generally provided for other children of the 			same age in mainstream schools or mainstream post-16 institution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.	Most children/young people with <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> will have their needs met through good quality 	teaching and differentiation within the mainstream classroom alongside the rest of their 	peers.  Having an identified <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> does not necessarily mean that a child/young person will 	require a personalised programme of intervention or tuition to ensure they achieve their 	potential.</p>

<p>4.	Many children/young people with identified <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> are working within the average cognitive 	range and have functional literacy and numeracy skills which should enable them to access 	a broad and balanced curriculum with additional consideration and differentiation offered by 	the classroom teacher.  Some children/young people may require a personalised, time 	restricted and targeted period of intervention to assist them to progress into the average 	range and obtain functional literacy and numeracy.  It is also acknowledged that not all 	barriers to learning are of a cognitive nature and that some children/young people may 	benefit from support for presenting social, emotional and mental health needs.  We expect 	that families would have sought professional guidance for these needs to inform the 	provision offered by the school.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> application and approval process</h2>

<h2>Parent/families role and responsibilities:</h2>

<p>5.	It is essential that parents are conversant with JSP 752 Chapter 14 prior to the application for <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>. The parent holds the contract with the school they have chosen for their child/ young person.  It is the parent’s responsibility to ensure that the provision being made for their child/young person is adequate and is allowing the child/young person to make progress in line with their peers.  The parent has the right to request information on how the school are meeting the needs of their child/young person and what reasonable adjustments the school are making to ensure their child/young person’s needs are being catered for.</p>

<p>6.	In relation to the <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> process, the parent should request that the member of staff responsible for co-ordinating learning support at the school completes the <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application form (DCS Form 013 – <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>)) provided by CEAS in the appropriate detail. Guidance on the completion of DCS Form 013 – <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) is provided within the application form itself.  The completed <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) 	Application form is returned to the parents who then check the detail, complete the section asking for their comments on the additional provision proposed, sign the form and return to DCS professionals for consideration.  It can take up to 9 weeks for a <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> application to be reviewed and processed so forward planning is recommended.  It is advised that you make your application for a <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> renewal at least a half term prior to the current <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> certificate expiring to avoid any lapse in funding.</p>

<p>7.	CEAS will not accept documentation sent directly from the school. DCS staff will not 	contact schools directly and ask for additional evidence or information in support of a 	<abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) application. Therefore, it is essential that the documentation provided by the 	school is complete and accurately reflects the current presenting needs of the child/young 	person concerned.</p>

<p>8.	It is the responsibility of parents to be instrumental in overseeing the support provided to 	their child/young person.  It is a parent’s right to ask the school to account for the provision 	delivered and to provide evidence of what impact any provision has had on their 	child/young person’s progress and well-being.</p>

<h2>Child/young person’s role and responsibilities:</h2>

<p>9.	The child/young person should have a voice in planning and reviewing any additional 	support they are receiving.  The child’s voice should be recorded in a format which is most 	suitable to their needs.</p>

<p>10.	It is very important that the child/young person feels involved in the provision and is an 	active participant.  There is a section on the <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application form for the 	child/young person to complete or we will accept any other preferred format.  DCS 	professionals welcome and encourage children/young people to express their views and 	opinions on the education and additional provision they are receiving.</p>

<h2>DCS’ role and responsibilities</h2>

<p>11.	DCS professionals sit on a panel to review <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> applications as they are received from 	families. DCS professionals involved in assessing the evidence submitted by schools in 	support of the <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> application, must read all the evidence presented, look at the context 	of the school (via the website), and assess whether the evidence is sufficiently robust with 	which to make a decision about agreeing, or not, to any <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> request.</p>

<p>12.	DCS professionals are tasked to adhere to the military regulations, whilst having the 	needs of the child/young person as paramount. As a general rule, a child/young person at 	an independent boarding school should not be advantaged because they have more than 	would normally be found in a state school, to meet their <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr>. This is with the 	understanding that Independent schools do not have to abide by the SEND Code of 	Practice (apart from the section 41 list), but as the Independent Schools Council states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Independent schools should already have systems in place to identify <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> and provide 	<abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> support.  The Code sets out good practice and independent schools may therefore 	want to look at this to help them review the systems they already have in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>13.	DCS professionals will review the evidence presented on the <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application 	form and any other supporting documentation provided by the school and ascertain if:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.	The needs presented by the child/young person require remediation to allow them 		to achieve in the average cognitive range and obtain functional literacy and/or 			numeracy when compared to other children of the same age;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b.	The proposed programme of support matches the evidenced <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> of the child;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.	There is evidence of a graduated response to the child/young person’s <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> by the 		school;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d.	Advice offered by specialist agencies in relation to the child/ young person’s 			presenting <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> has been considered in the planning of the support for the child;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e.	There is evidence of measurable outcomes of any prior support provided by the 			school to meet presenting <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr>.</p>

<p>14.	<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> applications will not be approved if insufficient or inappropriate evidence is provided. 	It is expected that schools will complete a personalised <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application form for 	each child/young person focused on their current individual <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr>.  DCS professionals 	have access to all prior <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> applications and any documentation previously forwarded to 	CEAS.</p>

<p>15.	<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> will not be awarded for study skills, developing higher order skills or preparation for 	examinations.  It is considered that these should form part of normal classroom teaching 	and that all children/ young people will be taught these skills.  However, it is accepted that 	some learners may require support with basic skills which, without remediation, could 	cause barriers for them in accessing these skills.  Therefore, we would anticipate that any 	requests for <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> would present evidence identifying the barriers and present a plan to 	potentially overcome them which measures impact and outcomes.</p>

<h2>School/College’s Role &amp; Responsibilities</h2>

<p>16.	Upon parental request, schools will be asked to complete a <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application form 	following the guidance within detailing the expectations and requirements of completion.  	Once school staff have completed the <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application form, they should return it to 	the parent so that it can be used to process their <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> application.</p>

<p>17.	The <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application form is a school’s opportunity to share with DCS	professionals the reasons behind the requirement for additional funding in support of the 	<abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr> currently presented by a child/young person.  DCS professionals need to ensure due 	rigour and consistency in how <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> is considered and awarded. It is therefore important 	that school staff provide as much information as possible within the <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>(<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>) Application 	form.</p>

<p>18.	Current school generated information is required to evidence the level and impact of a 	child/young person’s <abbr title="Special Educational Needs">SEN</abbr>. It is acknowledged that school staff have the experience and 	knowledge of individual children/young people and should be the best source of detailed 	information, collected over time, as to an individual child/ young person.</p>

<p>19.	We would expect that any information presented by the school would demonstrate the 	reasonable adjustments the school makes for the individual and also displays how any 	proposed funding via <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> would provide something additional to or different from this 	provision.  We also anticipate that any presenting needs can be evidenced over time and 	that there is indication of a graduated response to the presenting need.  We also anticipate 	that the school would be able to evidence how they have supported the inclusion of the 	individual in accessing a broad and balanced curriculum alongside their peers.</p>

<p>20.	If schools are re-applying for <abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr>, we would expect that current documentary evidence is 	presented to demonstrate the measurable impact of any previous intervention and how any 	next steps will further enhance the child/ young person’s learning and well-being.</p>

<p>21.	We anticipate that all schools will demonstrate within the evidence they present for the 	<abbr title="Special Educational Needs Addition">SENA</abbr> application how they are working with the duties outlined by the 2010 Equality Act, 	which requires all schools to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ when working with a child/ 	young person with special educational needs.</p>
