<h2>Books and stationery</h2>

<p>When children attend non-MOD schools overseas, the refund of the cost of essential books and stationery as required by the school authorities and that would be normally provided free of charge in England’s State maintained sector, is admissible. Such claims are subject to audit, and refunds will be made only on production of suitable receipts.</p>

<h2>What do pupils usually have access to (free of charge) when attending a primary school in England?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pencil</li>
  <li>Pen</li>
  <li>Ruler</li>
  <li>Rubber</li>
  <li>Sharpener</li>
  <li>Coloured pencils (shared)</li>
  <li>Felt pens (shared)</li>
  <li>Maths exercise book</li>
  <li>English exercise book</li>
  <li>Sketch/art technology</li>
  <li>Exercise book</li>
  <li>Topic exercise book</li>
  <li>Reading books</li>
  <li>Reading diary.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> This is not an exhaustive list and there may be other items which some schools in England refund, where others don’t. Parents should be aware that there is no 100% automatic refund of stationery items purchased whilst overseas and without valid receipts, refunds cannot be processed. If stationery costs are included as mandatory by the school (written evidence required), then parents will be able to apply for a refund to ensure they are not disadvantaged.</p>

<h3>Secondary Pupils</h3>

<p>In England, children in secondary schools are expected to have their own stationery and therefore refunds are not admissible overseas.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>Where electronic devices are provided on a staged payment or deposit basis, costs cannot be reclaimed if the device becomes the property of the claimant/child at any time during the posting.</p>
