<h2>Withdrawing from Continuity of Education Allowance (<abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr>): queries and concerns</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Can I claim <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> again at a later date if I am assigned away from my child’s school?</h2>

<p>Withdrawing from <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> is seen as a permanent decision <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tri-service-regulations-for-expenses-and-allowances-jsp-752">(JSP 752, Chap 14, Para 14.0125)</a>.  If you are considering reapplying for the allowance after you have withdrawn, you will need to submit casework to DBS PACCC through your Admin Unit.</p>

<p>Your casework should be robust with strong reasons as to why you feel reapplying for <abbr title="Continuity of Education Allowance">CEA</abbr> is now necessary.  Each case will be looked at individually by DBS PACCC before a decision is made about the allowance.  CEAS may be asked to give educational input, but we are not decision makers in this respect.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	How do I go about finding a new school?</h2>

<p>If you are having difficulty finding a place at a local school, we would suggest that you get in touch with CEAS who can give you bespoke educational advice depending on where in the country you are living.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Will my child receive a lower standard of education?</h2>

<p>Not necessarily. There are many differences between independent and state schools, and there are fantastic schools in both sectors.  Some of the top performing state schools in the country have students who achieve equally as well as their counterparts in independent schools.  Children from state schools go on to achieve wonderful things.  The Russell Group of universities, which includes Oxford and Cambridge universities, state that currently around 4 out of 5 children studying with them have been educated at a state school.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> I feel that my child is just not going to cope at a large school, I’m afraid they will get ‘swallowed up’.</h2>

<p>Some independent schools have children grouped in small classes, and it can be a bit of a shock when you arrive at a large 1,000 plus secondary school.  However, bear in mind that a larger school will, by its very nature, be able to provide a much wider range of extra-curricular activities and subjects.  Your child will also have a much wider group of peers to engage with to find like-minded friends.</p>

<p>Consider approaching the school to ask for some enhanced transition work.  This may help if your child is anxious about the move.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>	What are the positives of attending a state school?</h2>

<p>There are many:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state schools are bound by documents such as the National Curriculum, <abbr title="Special Educational Needs and/or Disability">SEND</abbr> Code of Practice and the Schools Admission Code.  This is not the case with independent schools</li>
  <li>a state school is able to access Local Authority educational services, whereas an independent school cannot</li>
  <li>the mix of people your child will encounter at state school is far more reflective of ‘the real world’.  This may help them when transitioning from school to adult life</li>
  <li>having the opportunity to be actively engaged in your child’s school and becoming part of the school community. Parent and Teacher association, school governor, regularly attending assemblies and sports’ fixtures are examples of how you can be proactively involved</li>
  <li>it may be easier for you to visit the school and talk informally to your child’s teachers</li>
  <li>your child will become a part of their local community, with school friends living close by and easily accessible after school and at weekends.</li>
</ul>
