<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The National Tutoring Programme (<abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>) is an ambitious scheme intended to provide additional, targeted support for those children and young people in schools who have been most affected by disruption to their education as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>During the first year of the programme introduced in November of the 2020 to 2021 academic year, state-maintained primary and secondary schools in England were able to access high-quality subsidised tutoring provision for 5 to 16-year-olds using 2 routes, tuition partners and academic mentors.</p>

<p>The second year covers the 2021 to 2022 academic year and builds on the first phase. Based on feedback from schools, we have expanded the <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> for the second year of the programme, offering state-funded schools and academy trusts 3 routes to tutoring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tuition partners</li>
  <li>academic mentors</li>
  <li>school-led tutoring</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reasons for introducing <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Tutoring is one of the most effective ways to accelerate pupil progress. Evidence suggests that small group and one-to-one tuition can boost progress by 3 to 5 months per pupil. By providing high-quality tuition to pupils through the <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr>, we want to extend this catch-up opportunity to pupils whose education has been impacted the most by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Impact of <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> in the 2020 to 2021 academic year</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> was launched in November 2020, and 240,200 pupils were enrolled for tuition in the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>

<p>As of the 2 July 2021, tuition partners are working with over 5,700 schools. 46% of schools on the programme have a greater than average percentage of pupils receiving pupil premium funding.</p>

<p>Tuition partners have recruited almost 27,000 tutors. This exceeds the end of year target and means supply is well developed across all regions.</p>

<p>We have also placed over 1,000 academic mentors in almost 950 schools. 83% of placements have been in schools with a greater than average proportion of pupils in receipt of pupil premium. As of the 18 May 2021, academic mentors have supported over 62,000 pupils.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> in the academic year 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>On 2 June 2021, the Department for Education announced that it was <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/huge-expansion-of-tutoring-in-next-step-of-education-recovery">investing a further £1 billion in its education recovery programme over the next 3 years</a>. Alongside extra provision for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.teachneli.org/" rel="external">NELI (Nuffield early language intervention) programme</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund">16 to 19 tutoring provision</a>, this includes a huge expansion to the <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> which will support up to 6 million pupils aged 5 to 16 and 15-hour tutoring packages.</p>

<p>Building on the success of <abbr title="The National Tutoring Programme">NTP</abbr> in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, we have listened to feedback from schools and stakeholders and further developed the breadth of the programme for 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<p>We recognise that each school has pupils with varying needs so have developed a tutoring proposition that provides a high degree of flexibility and choice. We have developed options that make it easier for schools to access tutoring while ensuring that schools can still exercise a high degree of discretion to support the pupils schools believe are most in need.</p>

<h2>National tutoring programme options</h2>

<p>There are 3 subsidised tutoring options available to state-funded schools in England for the 2021 to 2022 academic year. The remaining costs will be funded by schools using, for example, the recovery premium or pupil premium.</p>

<h2>Tuition partners</h2>

<p>Schools can access subsidised tutoring from an approved list of tutoring providers known as tuition partners. Approved tuition partners have passed a set of quality, safeguarding and evaluation standards. Tuition partners offer a range of subjects and provide targeted support for pupils in small group or one-to-one sessions. This option offers additional tutoring capacity to schools, especially in some regions where this is scarce. It also provides a high level of flexibility to schools and academy trusts without them having to use their own staff and a selection of providers who can tailor their expertise to support particular identified needs.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tuition-partners">apply for tuition partners</a>.</p>

<h2>Academic mentors</h2>

<p>Academic mentors are salaried members of staff and will work alongside teachers to provide a range of interventions, focusing on small group and one-to-one sessions. They provide support tailored to schools, including subject-specific work, revision lessons and additional support. Academic mentors are carefully selected based on skills and experience and undergo intensive training before being placed in a school.</p>

<h3>School-led tutoring</h3>

<p>School-led tutoring is available for eligible state-funded schools and academy trusts based on the number of pupil premium students. This payment is ring-fenced to fund locally sourced tutoring provision for disadvantaged pupils. This could include using existing staff such as teachers and teaching assistants or external tutoring resources such as private tutors or returning teachers. The grant gives schools and academy trusts the flexibility to use tutors with whom they are familiar.</p>
