<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The National Tutoring programme (<abbr title="National Tutoring programme">NTP</abbr>) was launched in November 2020 to provide additional, targeted support for children and young people whose education has been most affected by the disruption of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Tutoring is one of the most effective ways to accelerate pupil progress. Evidence suggests that small group and one-to-one tuition can boost progress by 3 to 5 months per pupil, as evidenced by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit/small-group-tuition?utm_source=/education-evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit/small-group-tuition&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=site_search&amp;search_term=tui" rel="external">Education Endowment Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>The programme offers state-funded schools and academy trusts the option to deliver tutoring through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tuition partners</li>
  <li>academic mentors</li>
  <li>school-led tutoring</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="National Tutoring programme">NTP</abbr>&nbsp;in the 2022 to 2023 academic year</h2>

<p>On 31 March 2022, the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) announced plans to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-tutoring-programme-simplified-to-reach-as-many-pupils-as-possible">simplify the&nbsp;<abbr title="National Tutoring programme">NTP</abbr>&nbsp;for academic year 2022 to 2023</a> to ensure high quality tuition reaches pupils who need it the most and to streamline the process for schools. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all schools will receive their tuition funding directly</li>
  <li>all tuition options will have the same 60% subsidy rate</li>
</ul>

<p>To assist forward planning and to avoid disruption to pupils:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools currently using approved&nbsp;<abbr title="National Tutoring programme">NTP</abbr>&nbsp;tuition partners will be able to continue working with them in 2022 to 2023, where the organisation remains on the programme</li>
  <li>schools with&nbsp;academic mentors (<abbr title="Academic mentors">AMs</abbr>)&nbsp;on their staff can continue to employ them in 2022 to 2023</li>
  <li>schools can continue to recruit&nbsp;<abbr title="Academic mentors">AMs</abbr>&nbsp;– both through the delivery partner and via headteacher nominations</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on how to organise tuition delivered through the <abbr title="National Tutoring programme">NTP</abbr> for the academic year 2022 to 2023, please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-tutoring-programme-guidance-for-schools-2022-to-2023">guidance for schools</a>.</p>

<h3>Tuition partners</h3>

<p>Schools can access subsidised tutoring from an approved list of tutoring providers known as tuition partners (<abbr title="Tuition partners">TPs</abbr>). Approved&nbsp;<abbr title="Tuition partners">TPs</abbr>&nbsp;have passed a set of quality, safeguarding and evaluation standards. They offer a range of subjects and provide targeted support for pupils in small group or one-to-one sessions.</p>

<p>This option offers additional tutoring capacity to schools and the ability to offer tuition without using their own staff. In addition, they have access to a selection of providers who can tailor their expertise to support specific needs.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tuition-partners">apply for tuition partners</a>.</p>

<h3>Academic mentors</h3>

<p>Academic mentors (<abbr title="Academic mentors">AMs</abbr>) are salaried members of staff who work alongside teachers to provide a range of interventions, focusing on small group and one-to-one sessions. They provide tailored support to schools, including subject-specific work and revision lessons. <abbr title="Academic mentors">AMs</abbr> are carefully selected based on skills and experience and undergo intensive training before being placed in a school.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academic-mentors">apply for academic mentors</a>.</p>

<h3>School-led tutoring</h3>

<p>The school-led tutoring grant allows eligible schools to fund locally sourced tutoring provision. The grant is ring-fenced and gives schools the flexibility to use tutors with whom they are familiar. This could include existing staff such as teachers and teaching assistants or external tutoring resources such as private tutors or returning teachers.</p>
