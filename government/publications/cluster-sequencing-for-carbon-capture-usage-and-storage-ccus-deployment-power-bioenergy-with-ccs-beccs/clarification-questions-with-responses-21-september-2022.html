<p><strong>001: Will funding for the power <abbr title="bioenergy with carbon capture and storage">BECCS</abbr> projects come from the same funding pot as the other power <abbr title="carbon capture, usage and storage">CCUS</abbr> projects that have been shortlisted for Phase-2 of the Cluster Sequencing Process?</strong></p>

<p>Response: As set out in the Net Zero Strategy the government has an ambition to deploy 5MTCO2/year of engineered greenhouse gas removals by 2050. Government also will seek to bring forward at least one power <abbr title="carbon capture, usage and storage">CCUS</abbr> plant in the mid-2020s through the Cluster Sequencing Process. The realisation of these will be subject to the outcome of project assessment and selection&nbsp;processes that will include value for money and affordability considerations of projects.</p>

<p><strong>002: Will the power <abbr title="bioenergy with carbon capture and storage">BECCS</abbr> project submissions have the same negotiation timeline as Phase-2 shortlisted projects?</strong></p>

<p>Response: After the assessment of project submissions, shortlisted projects will be invited to participate in a due diligence stage from 15 December 2022, and negotiations on a timeline which is yet to be confirmed. Following evaluation of projects and close of negotiations and due diligence processes, government intends to announce the list of Projects it intends to provide financial support. The timelines for these announcements will be made in due course.&nbsp;Timelines are indicative, and government reserves the right to alter these timelines at any stage in the process.</p>
