<h2>Key information</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-and-borders-bill-chagossian-nationality-factsheet/update-on-the-proposed-new-route-for-chagossians-to-acquire-british-nationality">update on the proposed new route for Chagossians to acquire British nationality</a>.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Chagossians are the former residents of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) also known as the Chagos Islands, who were removed from the islands, predominantly to Mauritius, between the mid-1960s and early-1970s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>while those Chagossians born on the islands and their children born outside British territory hold British nationality, subsequent generations born outside British territory currently have no entitlement to it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Nationality and Borders Bill will create an entitlement for direct descendants of Chagossians who were born on the islands that now form part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, and who are not already British Overseas Territory citizens (BOTCs) or British citizens, to acquire both those forms of British nationality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Home Office will create an application process that will allow direct descendants, to apply to be registered as a BOTC and as a British citizen. Applicants will not be required to pay an application fee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the application process will be time limited. All applications from adults must be made within 5 years of the process commencing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those under the age of 18 years old and those born during the 5-year period for making applications will have until the age of 23 to decide if they wish to apply under this route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why we have created this route</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Home Office has listened to the concerns raised by the Chagossian community about the impact the combination of the removal of the Chagossians from the British Indian Ocean Territory in the 1960s and 1970s, and the limited recognition of their removal in nationality legislation, has had on their ability to access British nationality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having carefully considered the unique situation of the Chagossians, we have concluded it would be feasible to create a bespoke British nationality route for Chagossians, without weakening the general legal principles governing the acquisition of British nationality overseas by descent</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Who will be able to apply</h3>

<ul>
  <li>direct descendants of those born on the Chagos Islands, who aren’t already BOTC or British citizens, will be able to apply to register as a BOTC and British citizen</li>
</ul>

<h3>How the time limited element will work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>adults will have 5 years from the commencement of the measure to make an application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who are children when the route is launched or who are born within the 5-year application period after commencement, will have until they are 23 years old to claim this entitlement to British nationality</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When this provision will start</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we are working to implement this provision as soon as possible once we have all the necessary processes in place to allow Chagossian descendants to apply</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we will announce further details and communicate the commencement date to the Chagossian community in due course</p>
  </li>
</ul>
