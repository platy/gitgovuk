<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 9-series National Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 — 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>95P: Goods from a Special Fiscal Territory or Territory with which the EU has formed a customs union, placed under a non-customs warehousing procedure (excise warehousing) where both VAT and Excise duty is suspended</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a>) should be declared first (see <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a> must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2>
