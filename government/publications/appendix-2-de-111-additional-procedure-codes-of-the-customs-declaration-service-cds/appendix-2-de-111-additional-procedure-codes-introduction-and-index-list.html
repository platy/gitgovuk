<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for each 3-digit Union and National Additional Procedure Code that can be used in Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 2 take precedence.</p>

<p>The Appendix is broken into two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#Appendix-2A-DE-1-11-Additional-Procedure-Codes-Union-Codes">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#Appendix-2B-DE-1-11-Additional-Procedure-Codes-National-Codes">Appendix 2B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: National Codes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a>) should be declared first (see <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<h3>General declaration completion notes:</h3>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2>Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes Index List</h2>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 — 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>Where this Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) is used to specify a Union Additional Procedure Code, the first character of the code identifies a customs procedural treatment in the following series:</p>

<p>Inward processing Axx<br>
Outward processing Bxx<br>
Relief Cxx<br>
Temporary admission Dxx<br>
Agricultural products  Exx<br>
Other Fxx<br></p>

<p>The following tables provide an index list of each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code that may be used in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 and its description:</p>

<h3>Relief (Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009(1))</h3>

<h4>C-Series</h4>

<p>(C series codes relieve the customs duty only, the notes for each code should be read to see if VAT relief is also possible. Where VAT relief is also allowed, code F45 or 1RV (*) should be used in addition to the C code in order to claim VAT relief as instructed by the specific C codes guidance notes.)</p>
