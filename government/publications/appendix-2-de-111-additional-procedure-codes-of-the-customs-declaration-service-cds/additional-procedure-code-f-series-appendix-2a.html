<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declarations Service (CDS) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a>) should be declared first (see CDS Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<h3>General declaration completion notes:</h3>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence.</p>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h2>F01: Relief from import duties for returned goods (Article 203 of the Code)</h2>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>): Relief from import duties for returned goods (Article 203, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Any customs duties refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export.</p>

<p>Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236</a> for additional conditions for eligibility for <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate 4-digit Procedure Code completion notes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10).</p>

<h2>F07: Processed products which returned to the European Union after having been previously re-exported subsequent to an inward processing procedure where the import duty is determined in accordance with Article 86(3) of the Code (Article 205(2) of the Code)</h2>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<p>Processed products which are re-imported to the European Union after having been previously re-exported after an inward processing procedure where the import duty is determined in accordance with Article 86(3) and Article 205(2) of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Goods covered:</h3>

<p>Goods previously placed under inward processing, subsequently re-exported from the EU, which are now returning to the EU where the customs debt is incurred on the basis of Article 86(3) of the <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code is used to claim a reduced valuation for duty purposes under <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> on their release to free circulation for goods re-imported in an unaltered state, that were previously re-exported under <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> (Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>The customs value at re-importation may be based upon the raw materials originally entered to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> where the declarant has opted to use the Article 86(3) customs debt rules, as laid down in EU Reg. No. 952/2013.</p>

<p>The description and particulars of the goods entered on the re-import declaration must be completed on the basis of the details declared at re-export. However, the customs duty calculation may be based upon the details of the goods originally entered to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>) may be claimed on their release to free circulation on any elements of the re-imported products which had Union status at the time of re-export.</p>

<p>Duty is payable on their release to free circulation on any non-Union elements of the re-imported products (i.e. any goods/parts originally entered to Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>)). F07 may only be used at re-import where Additional Procedure Code F44 was declared on both the original declaration entering the goods to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> as well as the re-export declaration.</p>

<p>Goods must return in an un-altered state from export, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods whilst exported, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods whilst exported that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at export and re-import must be the same entity (the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number or named person shown in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 at export and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/15 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 at import must be the same).</p>

<p>VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union unless the specific conditions <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236</a> are met.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236</a> for additional conditions for eligibility for <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate 4-digit Procedure Code completion notes used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10).</p>

<h3>Restriction on usage:</h3>

<p>Where F44 was not used to enter the goods to <abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr> originally or was not declared on the previous re-export declaration, the goods are not eligible for F07 on re-import.  Additional Procedure Code F04 must be used instead.</p>

<p>Where an INF document code is declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>) may not be used.</p>

<h2>F47: Simplification of the drawing-up of customs declarations for goods falling under different tariff subheadings</h2>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<h4>Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>):</h4>

<p>Simplification of the drawing-up of customs declarations for goods falling under different tariff subheadings provided for in Article 177 of the Union Customs Code (Regulation No. (EU) 952/2013 and Article 228 of Regulation No. (EU) 2015/2447.</p>

<h4>Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>):</h4>

<p>Simplification of the drawing-up of customs declarations for goods falling under different tariff subheadings provided for in Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (TCTA 2018), Schedule 1(7) and (8).</p>

<h3>Goods covered:</h3>

<p>Where a consignment is made up of goods falling within different tariff subheadings, the declarant may opt for the import duty be charged on the whole consignment on the basis of the tariff subheading for the goods which are subject to the highest rate of import duty.</p>

<p>Subject to the conditions and restrictions stated below, goods may be grouped on the declaration as a single goods item declared using the commodity code that attracts the highest duty rate.</p>

<h3>Permitted Import Movements:</h3>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code may be used to declare goods moving from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Rest of the World (<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr>) to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr> to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<h4>General Conditions:</h4>

<p>The use of the Additional Procedure Code forms a legal undertaking by the legal Declarant to accept liability for any debts that arise as a result of its use.</p>

<p>The use of this Additional Procedure Code constitutes a legal declaration that the following conditions for grouping will be complied with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all goods being grouped are exempt or eligible for a waiver from prohibitions, restrictions and licensing requirements</li>
  <li>the grouped goods will be declared under the commodity code that attracts the highest duty rate</li>
  <li>where grouped goods are eligible for preference, they are declared at the highest preferential duty rate applicable</li>
  <li>all grouped goods are eligible to be declared for the Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10) being used</li>
  <li>all grouped goods meet the terms and conditions for any other Additional Procedure Codes (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) declared</li>
  <li>evidence must be held and made available to customs on request demonstrating compliance with the terms and conditions of the Additional Procedure Code</li>
  <li>a detailed breakdown of the goods being grouped must be held in the commercial records and will be subject to audit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grouping Variable Duty Rate Goods (specific duty):</h3>

<p>Variable Duty Rate goods may be grouped providing the following conditions are met:</p>

<h4>Goods subject to the same measurement unit (Regulation No. (EU) 2015/2447, article 228(1)/ TCTA 2018, Schedule 1(8)):</h4>

<p>Where goods are subject to a variable duty rate and the same measurement units applies to all the goods being grouped (e.g. the duty is calculated on litres for all the grouped goods) then the commodity code subject to the highest rate of specific duty must be used.</p>

<h4>Goods subject to different measurement units (Regulation No. (EU) 2015/2447, article 228(2)) TCTA 2018, Schedule 1(8):</h4>

<p>Where goods are subject to a variable duty rate and different measurement units apply, then the commodity code that attracts the highest specific duty rate must be identified for each separate measurement unit that applies to the goods.</p>

<p>The duty must then be calculated (OVR01 is not required unless specified by another Procedure Code, Additional Procedure Code or AI statement) for each type of measurement unit applicable and applied to the customs value to identify the ad valorem duty for each item. The highest ad valorem duty rate will then be charged on the whole consignment.  For example, where a consignment is made up of an item subject to a duty of £2 per litre and another item subject to a duty of £3 per kg, calculate the total duty applicable on each item by multiplying rate by the measure (e.g. £2 per litre multiplied by the number of litres and £3 per kg by the number of kgs). Then divide each respectively by the customs value of the item in question to get the ad valorem duty for each item (e.g. if there are 10 litres at £2 per litre and the item value is £100 divide 20 by 100 to get an ad valorem duty of 20% and if there are 20kgs at £3 per kg and the item value is £600 divide 60 by 600 to get an ad valorem duty of 10%). Duty would then be charged on the whole consignment, this being the highest ad valorem duty.</p>

<p>The quantity of goods being imported must then be converted into the single measurement unit type that applies to the chosen commodity code (for example, the commodity code is calculated in litres, all quantities must be converted to litres).</p>

<h4>Grouping variable rate and ad valorem duty rate goods (Regulation No. (EU) 2015/2447, article 228(3))/ TCTA 2018, Schedule 1(8):</h4>

<p>For consignments being grouped where some goods attract an ad valorem duty rate and some are subject to a variable rate (specific duty):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the highest rate of duty for the goods subject to a standard ad valorem rate must be identified</li>
  <li>the highest specific duty must be identified for the goods subject to a variable rate</li>
  <li>the specific duty must be converted into an ad valorem duty (see above) — OVR01 is not required unless specified by another Procedure Code, Additional Procedure Code or AI statement</li>
  <li>the commodity code selected must then be the item subject to the highest rate of either: the converted specific duty or the standard ad valorem rate goods</li>
</ul>
