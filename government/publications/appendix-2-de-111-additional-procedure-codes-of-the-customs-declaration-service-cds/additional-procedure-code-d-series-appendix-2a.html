<h2>General Notes on D-Series Additional Procedure Codes:</h2>

<p>The importer (declared in Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 3/15 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16) must be the authorisation holder for Temporary Admission.</p>

<p>The authorisation holder must also be the user of the goods unless an exemption is allowed for the specific the Additional Procedure Code (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11). This will be indicated by the inclusion of a GEN Additional Information (AI) Statement Code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information). The appropriate GEN Code must be declared on the declaration according to the type of authorisation held (Full or Authorisation by Customs Declaration).</p>

<p>All D-series codes can be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>) unless the declarant is using Authorisation by Customs Declaration (AI statement 00100 declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information)). However, to be eligible to use simplified procedures, the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code must also permit the use of Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the D-series Union Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 — 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (CDS) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a> should be declared first (see CDS Declaration Completion Instructions for Import, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes:</h2>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence.</p>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>
