<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 6-series National Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) 1/11 for Imports.</p>

<p>Use the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 — 1/11 correlation matrix, Additional Procedure Code index list and their respective completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for additional guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>63P: Free Circulation goods, previously exported, now being re-imported with a simultaneous claim to Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr>) and Onward Supply Relief (<abbr title="onward supply relief">OSR</abbr>)</p>

<p>68P: Free circulation goods, previously exported, now being entered to an excise warehouse with a simultaneous claim to Returned Goods Relief</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a>) should be declared first (see <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<span class="number">63P: </span> Free Circulation goods, previously exported, now being re-imported with a simultaneous claim to Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr>) and Onward Supply Relief (<abbr title="onward supply relief">OSR</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>Description of procedure:</h3>

<h3>Goods covered:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Release for free circulation of re-imported goods in an unaltered state simultaneously claiming Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr>, Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) upon payment of any customs duties and other charges, where the goods were temporarily exported to a third country.</li>
  <li>Release for free circulation of goods simultaneously onward supplied to another Member State which are the subject of a VAT exempt (and where applicable excise duty-suspension) onward supply to another Member State (Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112 and/ or Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC), and where the goods have not been subject to any previous procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code may also be used where the goods are being released from a customs warehouse and claiming both <abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr> and <abbr title="onward supply relief">OSR</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Conditions for use:</h3>

<p>The goods must meet the conditions applicable for both <abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr> and <abbr title="onward supply relief">OSR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.</p>

<p>This additional procedure code is only to be used where the full conditions of both <abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr> and <abbr title="onward supply relief">OSR</abbr> are met.</p>

<h3>Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under <abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr> with simultaneous release for free circulation of goods re-imported in an unaltered state, where the goods were temporarily exported to a third country (Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<p>Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export.</p>

<p>The MRN of the export declaration or C21e must be declared as a previous document in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using previous document code MRN.</p>

<p>Where alternative evidence is provided in lieu of an export declaration/ C21e MRN, the evidence used must:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants. 
No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<h3>Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>This Additional Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under <abbr title="returned goods relief">RGR</abbr> with simultaneous release for free circulation of goods re-imported in an unaltered state, where the goods were temporarily exported to a third country (Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.</p>

  <li>stock record book.</li>
</ul>

<p>Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.</p>

<p>No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at export and re-import must be the same entity (the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number or named person shown in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 at export and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/15 or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 at import must be the same).</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Procedure Code used on the declaration (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10).</p>

<h3>Restrictions on usage:</h3>
