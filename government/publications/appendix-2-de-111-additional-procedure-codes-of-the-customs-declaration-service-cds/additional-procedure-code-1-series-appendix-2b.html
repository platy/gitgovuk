<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires the use of both Union and National Additional Procedure Codes, Union Codes (from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds/appendix-2-de-111-additional-procedure-codes-introduction-and-index-list">Appendix 2A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11: Additional Procedure Codes: Union Codes</a>) should be declared first (see <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Declaration Completion Instructions for Imports, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 for more details).</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 1: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes are not repeated against or superseded by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 completion notes.</p>

<h2>General declaration completion notes</h2>

<p>Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item</li>
  <li>Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item</li>
  <li>It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that while <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The use of this Additional Procedure Code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief aren’t met.</li>
  <li>Agents must have prior written approval from the importer to enter goods to <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> on their behalf and ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder.</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236: Returned Goods Relief</a> defines what is meant by ‘Goods in free circulation’.</li>
  <li>All supporting materials (for example rope, wood and plastic) used for the storage and protection of the goods are also eligible for relief.</li>
  <li>Evidence of export and End Use status as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236: Returned Goods Relief</a>  except where the export declaration reference is quoted in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 (Previous Documents).</li>
  <li>Entry under this Procedure Code is a declaration that:</li>
  <li>If claiming duty relief:
    <ul>
      <li>The goods are eligible to claim <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>.</li>
      <li>Any additional security which may be needed will be provided.</li>
      <li>All other conditions and requirements associated with claiming <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> have been met.</li>
      <li>The goods had been entered to end use prior to their exportation from the customs territory of the EU or Territory with which the EU has formed a customs union.</li>
      <li>The goods are being entered for free circulation with <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> and End Use within 3 years of them being exported from that territory unless a valid waiver is claimed. A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.</li>
      <li>If the waiver of the 3-year time limit for reimportation is claimed due to special circumstances, insert ‘Waiver of time limit claimed’ in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 as a GEN03 AI Statement. This waiver must be shown to be reasonable to HMRC when requested.</li>
      <li>The goods haven’t undergone any process or repair outside that territory other than routine maintenance to keep them in good condition, or handling which only altered the goods appearance, for example attaching operating instructions in foreign languages.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If claiming VAT relief, it is a further declaration that:
    <ul>
      <li>the goods were exported from the EU by the importer or on their behalf.</li>
      <li>any VAT due on the goods was paid and not refunded on export from the EU.</li>

<p>VAT must be paid at importation unless relief is claimed in the following circumstances.</p>

<p>Parts and equipment (including safety equipment) for qualifying ships (excluding parts and equipment imported by a government department):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing the parts and equipment are of a kind ordinarily installed in the propulsion, navigation, or communication systems or the general structure of any ship of 15 tons or more not being a ship designed or adapted for use for recreation or pleasure or safety equipment for use in such a qualifying ship, relief from VAT may be claimed by additionally entering Additional Procedure Code 1RV in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</li>
</ul>

<p>Goods for drilling or production platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provided that the goods are incorporated into offshore drilling or production platforms for the purposes of the construction, repair, maintenance, conversion, fitting out or equipping of these platforms or to link such platforms to the mainland, relief from VAT may be claimed by additionally entering Additional Procedure Code 1RV in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</li>
</ul>

<p>Goods temporarily exported for treatment or process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods were in home use when last exported outside the EU</li>
  <li>were intended at their time of export to be re imported after completion of the treatment or process outside the EU</li>
  <li>have been repaired, processed, adapted, reworked or made up outside the EU</li>
  <li>ownership was not transferred to any other person at exportation or during the time they were outside the EU</li>
  <li>VAT was not reclaimed or zero rated at export.</li>
</ul>

<p>VAT will be payable on the difference in value between the exported and re-imported goods (i.e. increase in value as a result of processing).</p>

<p>If VAT was reclaimed or repaid at Export, VAT will be due on the full value of goods at reimport unless placed back under End Use.</p>

<h3>Re-imported goods where the importer is a VAT registered person importing the goods in the course of his business</h3>

<p>VAT relief may only be claimed if the following conditions for claiming relief are satisfied. The conditions require that the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>were last exported outside the EU by or on behalf of the importer who is a taxable person reimporting the goods in the course of his business</li>
  <li>have not been subjected to any process or repair outside the EU, other than necessary running repairs, which have increased their export value</li>
  <li>were owned by the importer at the time of exportation and have remained his property or were so owned and have been returned after rejection by a customer outside the EU or because it was not possible to deliver them to such customer; or have been returned from the continental shelf</li>
  <li>if supplied in, acquired in or imported into the EU before their export, any tax chargeable on that supply, acquisition or importation was accounted for or paid and neither has been, nor will be refunded</li>
</ul>

<p>VAT is chargeable at importation, unless exemption is claimed using Additional Procedure Code 1RV in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 in addition to 1SW.</p>

<p>If the process has been carried out free of charge, for example because the goods are covered by warranty, guarantee or service agreement, no VAT is chargeable on re-importation.</p>
