<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>General population COVID-19 testing is for asymptomatic individuals who want to book and pay for their own test.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out the minimum standards that private providers must meet when offering this testing service to organisations and members of the public.</p>

<p>It includes standards for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>asymptomatic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</li>
  <li>asymptomatic lateral flow tests</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different minimum standards, with separate guidance, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 2 lateral flow tests for international arrivals</li>
  <li>day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for international arrivals</li>
  <li>the Test to Release scheme for international travel</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access all these guidance pages from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/minimum-standards-for-private-sector-providers-of-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">Minimum standards for private sector providers of COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>General population tests cannot be used for day 2 or day 8 tests after international travel, or as part of the Test to Release scheme, because they have different minimum standards.</p>
</div>

<h2>Self-declaration</h2>

<p>Providers must <a rel="external" href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/PrivateSectorSelfDeclaration" class="govuk-link">complete a self-declaration form</a> stating that their tests meet all of these standards.</p>

<p>As well as declaring that they meet the minimum standards at the start of the service, they must maintain these standards.</p>

<p>This self-declaration must only be completed by front-end providers who will be directly selling general population COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic individuals.</p>

<p>The providers completing the self-declaration will self-declare on behalf of themselves and all of the organisations they’re working with to provide these tests. They will need to list all organisations that they will be working with (whether by subcontract or otherwise) in order to carry out this service.</p>

<p>If there’s a change to any information submitted in their self-declaration, the provider will need to notify the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) of the nature of the new arrangement.</p>

<p>Providers cannot legally sell tests until the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has provided written confirmation that it considers the provider meets the standards required.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation and the GOV.UK lists</h2>

<p>Providers that have completed their self-declaration and have been successfully assessed against the relevant minimum standards by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) will be published on the GOV.UK list of providers for the testing service they offer.</p>

<p>For more information and guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/find-an-organisation/"><abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>read government guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-become-a-private-provider-of-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">how to become a private provider of COVID-19 testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Penalties and offences</h2>

<p>If a private provider does not meet the standards required, they may be committing an offence and subject to enforcement action and the resultant penalty.</p>

<h2>Problems with test kits and results</h2>

<p>Where a test kit is broken, is not delivered or gives an inconclusive or invalid test result, the provider should offer a replacement kit as soon as possible to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards that apply to general population COVID-19 testing (domestic asymptomatic)</h2>

<p>The current minimum standards are summarised as follows:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Requirement of a clinical or medical director or equivalent and healthcare scientist</h3>
<p>The provider must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical issues. The individual must be a registered medical practitioner.</p>

<p>The provider must also have a designated resourced role that has oversight of clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting clinical issues. This individual must be a registered medical practitioner or a healthcare scientist, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.</p>

<p>The same individual can fulfil both roles (medical and clinical) providing they are duly registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> The test product must be permitted to be put into service in accordance with part 4 of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, other than solely by virtue of an authorisation made under regulation 39(2) of those regulations</h3>

<p>This requirement is to ensure that the test product has a CE marking (or, following the UK’s exit from the European Union, a <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> marking).</p>

<p>A CE mark is a logo that is placed on an in vitro diagnostic (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr>) medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC, as implemented by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (note: it’s currently an offence under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to place a device on the market or supply without a CE mark, unless a derogation has been obtained from <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002).</p>

<p>A CE mark shows that the device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety.</p>

<p>The word ‘approved’ relates to a process by which coronavirus test devices must be approved by the Secretary of State at the time that it is provided or dispatched to the international arrival. This is under regulation 34A of the Medical Devices Regulations, which was inserted into Part 4 by the Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>Tests with a <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> mark can be used. Tests with a CE mark can be used until July 2023.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Alignment to DHSC <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> target product profile scope</h3>
<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, setting out the ‘scope’ of what that test should be used for, including target use, target user and target use settings.</p>

<p>The provider must declare that they’re using the test in line with its published scope. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has set out guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work.</p>

</ul>

<p>Note: this standard only applies to providers solely providing COVID-19 testing services for domestic purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Reporting of coronavirus test results</h3>
<p>The test provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, negative, inconclusive (indeterminate) and void test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<p>Providers who use a laboratory to process test results are not under a legal requirement to report but should ensure they pass all relevant information to their laboratory to meet statutory requirements for reporting COVID-19 test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. Every effort should be made to provide the testing laboratory with the required case information. If the laboratory does not receive sufficient case information to report to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> directly, the laboratory will need to agree a process with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to ensure that the provider of the test, or a third-party client, provides the required test and case information to meet the laboratory’s legal reporting obligations.</p>

<h4>Point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>)</h4>

<p><abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> providers using NHS Test and Trace or government-provided kits should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report results online</a>.</p>

<p>For those using privately acquired <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> kits, please contact the <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> support team on <a href="mailto:poct.contact@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">poct.contact@phe.gov.uk</a>. This data must follow a specific format, and the template is available from the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> support team. Read the full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-and-influenza-point-of-care-testing-results-how-to-report">COVID-19 and influenza point-of-care testing results: how to report</a>.</p>

<p>It is a requirement that <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> providers transfer the following information to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, insofar as it is known to the test provider.</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>NHS number (if known)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>home address (including postcode)</li>
  <li>telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
  <li>email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the test provider</li>
  <li>the type of establishment of the test provider (for example school)</li>
  <li>test result code (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve or influenza A +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>specimen identification number (if applicable)</li>
  <li>specimen type</li>
  <li>specimen date</li>
  <li>date the test was performed</li>
  <li>test method (for example <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>name of the testing equipment manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<p>Positive and indeterminate COVID-19 test results should be reported to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> as soon as they are available from the test device and, at the latest, within 24 hours, which is the statutory requirement.</p>

<p>Negative and void COVID-19 test results, and positive, indeterminate, negative and void influenza test results, can be sent to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> within 7 days of testing.</p>

<h4>Laboratories</h4>

<p>There is a legal requirement for laboratories to report positive, negative, inconclusive (indeterminate) and void test results cases to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<p>To support the reporting of the required infectious diseases, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has developed the Second Generation Surveillance System (<abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr>). This is the national surveillance system that holds all test results.</p>

<p>It is understood that laboratories may not have established systems to report results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. However, there is a legal requirement to report. It is recommended that laboratories in this situation contact the <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> helpdesk on <a href="mailto:sgss.helpdesk@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sgss.helpdesk@phe.gov.uk</a> or the <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> COVID Incident Team on <a href="mailto:sgss.covidincident@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sgss.covidincident@phe.gov.uk</a> and they will put the laboratory in touch with the local <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> support team. Read the full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report#reporting-of-sars-cov-2-test-results-to-public-health-england">Notifiable diseases and causative organisms: how to report</a>.</p>

<p>Laboratories are legally required to report the following information to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, insofar as the laboratory has this information.</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>home address (including postcode) or alternative address if not home address</li>
  <li>contact telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for positive or indeterminate  results)</li>
  <li>contact email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for positive or indeterminate  results)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample taken date and time</li>
  <li>date and time sample was received by lab</li>
  <li>details of causative agent</li>
  <li>the result of any antimicrobial susceptibility test and any resistance mechanism identified in respect of the sample</li>
  <li>sample type</li>
  <li>test method (for example <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>result (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>name of laboratory</li>
  <li>address of laboratory</li>
  <li>name, address and organisation of the person who solicited the test</li>
</ul>

<p>Laboratories should ensure they receive all relevant information from the provider to ensure accurate reporting.</p>

<div role="note" class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning">
<p>If laboratories do not have this data, they should request the missing data from the provider who solicited the test, as it assists with daily contact tracing and helps to break down the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the legally required information outlined above, laboratories should also provide the following fields, insofar as the laboratory has this information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample number/specimen ID – the format of the specimen must be as follows: ‘Reporting Laboratory Shortcode’ (the laboratory shortcode is the code provided by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) – ‘sample ID’ (this should be unique regardless of test method). The specimen ID should be a maximum of 25 characters and you should quote this ID in any communication of the sample (for example ABC-8263792).</li>
  <li>result date</li>
  <li>other – please detail if additional information is available (any other required information should be submitted through this field)</li>
</ul>

<p>COVID-19 positive test results must be reported within 24 hours of being detected so that timely contact tracing can be employed to prevent the onward spread of the virus and, if possible, to report multiple times per day. Diagnostic laboratories are required to notify <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> of other test results within a maximum of 7 days, but daily reporting is preferred to enable timely public health action.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report" class="govuk-link">guidance for reporting notifiable diseases</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Relevant systems in place to report adverse test incidents</h3>

<p>The provider must be able to demonstrate that it has systems in place to identify any adverse incidents or quality control issues in respect of the test device and be able to report them in a timely manner to the relevant regulatory body. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has a dedicated COVID-19 Yellow Card portal to report adverse incidents with medicines, medical devices and diagnostics.</p>

<p>For further information, see:</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Samples shall be taken by a provider meeting or working towards ISO standard ISO15189 or ISO/IEC17025</h3>

<p><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, which outlines who should collect test samples under the ‘target user’ description.</p>

<p>The provider must have relevant competency-based trained test operators undertaking or overseeing sample collection dependent on test sample collection requirements.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.GOV.UK/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/for-industry-and-manufactures-covid-19-tests-and-testing-kits" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Read more about <abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr></a></p>

<p>The ISO standard and technical specifications set out the key components that should be considered to provide safe and reliable sample collection service.</p>

<p>Sampling can be accredited as part of a wider lab-based activity, or sampling can be the scope of a standalone, separately accredited legal entity.</p>

<p>For further information, see:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66912.html">ISO 17025</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Clinical governance</h3>
<p>The provider must have clear clinical governance procedures in place. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear governance and lines of accountability such as senior responsible officer, clinical lead, quality lead, training lead</li>
  <li>staff are appropriately trained and there is evidence of competency assessment and participation in relevant external quality assessment (<abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>liability and indemnity cover for staff</li>
  <li>a verification report for the laboratory element of the test (known as the assay), in line with national protocols for laboratory-based testing</li>
  <li>information management systems to monitor sample delivery and tracking</li>
  <li>systems to meet the provisions for handling, transportation and analysis of test samples</li>
  <li>working to containment level CL3 or CL2+ with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) approval for laboratory-based testing</li>
  <li>systems, processes and record management to support the delivery of safe and reliable service</li>

<p>For polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing, all samples must be processed by a <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited laboratory, or <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> applicant laboratory (the laboratory has applied for <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation but has not yet achieved it), and have quality management systems operating according to ISO 15189 and/or ISO/IEC 17025. ISO 15189 is the standard used in all NHS laboratories.</p>
