<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>General population coronavirus (COVID-19) testing is for asymptomatic individuals who want to book and pay for their own test.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out the minimum standards that private providers must meet when offering this testing service to organisations and members of the public.</p>

<p>It includes standards for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>asymptomatic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</li>
  <li>asymptomatic lateral flow tests</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different minimum standards, with separate guidance, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for international arrivals, also known as arrivals test</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access all these guidance pages from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/minimum-standards-for-private-sector-providers-of-covid-19-testing">Minimum standards for private sector providers of COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>General population tests cannot be used for day 2 tests after international travel, because they have different minimum standards.</p>
</div>

<h2>Self-declaration</h2>

<p>Providers must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/PrivateSectorSelfDeclaration" rel="external">complete a self-declaration form</a> stating that their tests meet all of these standards.</p>

<p>This self-declaration must only be completed by front-end providers who will be directly selling general population COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic individuals.</p>

<p>The providers completing the self-declaration will self-declare on behalf of themselves and all of the organisations they’re working with to provide these tests. They will need to list all organisations that they will be working with (whether by subcontract or otherwise) in order to carry out this service.</p>

<p>If there’s a change to any information submitted in their self-declaration, the provider will need to notify the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) of the nature of the new arrangement.</p>

<p>Providers cannot legally sell tests until they meet the standards required.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation and the GOV.UK lists</h2>

<p>Providers that have completed their self-declaration and have been successfully assessed against the relevant minimum standards by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) will be published on the GOV.UK list of providers for the testing service they offer.</p>

<p>For more information and guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/find-an-organisation/" rel="external"><abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</a>
</li>
  <li>read government guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-become-a-private-provider-of-covid-19-testing">how to become a private provider of COVID-19 testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Penalties and offences</h2>

<p>If a private provider does not meet the standards required, they may be committing an offence and subject to enforcement action and the resultant penalty.</p>

<h2>Problems with test kits and results</h2>

<p>Where a test kit is broken, is not delivered or gives an inconclusive or invalid test result, the provider should offer a replacement kit as soon as possible to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards that apply to general population COVID-19 testing (domestic asymptomatic)</h2>

<p>The current minimum standards are summarised as follows:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Requirement for a medical director and clinical scientist</h3>
<p>The provider must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical issues. The individual must be a registered medical practitioner – registered with the General Medical Council.</p>

<p>The provider must also have a designated resourced role that has oversight of clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting clinical issues. This individual must be a registered clinical scientist, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.</p>

<p>The same individual can fulfil both roles (medical and clinical) providing they are duly registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> The test device must be an approved COVID-19 test device which is permitted to be put into service in accordance with part 4 of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, other than solely by virtue of regulation 39(2) of those regulations</h3>

<p>This requirement is to ensure that the testing device has a CE marking (or, following the UK’s exit from the European Union, a UK marking) and does not benefit from a derogation from those standards. A CE mark is a logo that is placed on an in vitro diagnostic (<abbr title="in vitro diagnostic">IVD</abbr>) medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC.</p>

<p>A CE mark shows that the testing device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety. Tests with a CE mark can be used until 30 June 2023.</p>

<p>Alternatively a test with a <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> mark can be used.</p>

<p>All COVID-19 tests being supplied and put into service by private providers must have been approved under the Coronavirus Test Device Approvals (CTDA) legislation or listed on the protocol. The validation of COVID-19 tests has set a minimum bar for the performance of COVID-19 tests, which will drive up performance standards and give confidence to UK consumers in the accuracy and performance of the tests they procure.</p>

<p>The word ‘approved’ relates to a process by which coronavirus test devices must be approved by the Secretary of State at the time that it is provided/dispatched to the international arrival. This is under regulation 34A of the Medical Devices Regulations, which was inserted into Part 4 by the Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles:">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, setting out the ‘scope’ of what that test should be used for, including target use, target user and target use settings.</p>

<p>The provider must declare that they’re using the test in line with its published scope. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has set out guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Reporting of coronavirus test results</h3>
<p>The test provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, negative, inconclusive (indeterminate) and void test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<p>Providers who use a laboratory to process test results are not under a legal requirement to report but should ensure they pass all relevant information to their laboratory to meet statutory requirements for reporting COVID-19 test results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. Every effort should be made to provide the testing laboratory with the required case information. If the laboratory does not receive sufficient case information to report to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> directly, the laboratory will need to agree a process with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to ensure that the provider of the test, or a third-party client, provides the required test and case information to meet the laboratory’s legal reporting obligations.</p>

<h4>Point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>)</h4>

<p><abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> providers using NHS Test and Trace or government-provided kits should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report results online</a>.</p>

<p>For those using privately acquired <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> kits, please contact the <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> support team on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:poct.contact@phe.gov.uk">poct.contact@phe.gov.uk</a>. This data must follow a specific format, and the template is available from the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> support team. Read the full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-and-influenza-point-of-care-testing-results-how-to-report">COVID-19 and influenza point-of-care testing results: how to report</a>.</p>

<p>It is a requirement that <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> providers transfer the following information to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, insofar as it is known to the test provider.</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>NHS number (if known)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>home address (including postcode)</li>
  <li>telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
  <li>email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the test provider</li>
  <li>the type of establishment of the test provider (for example school)</li>
  <li>test result code (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve or influenza A +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>specimen identification number (if applicable)</li>
  <li>specimen type</li>
  <li>specimen date</li>
  <li>date the test was performed</li>
  <li>test method (for example <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>name of the testing equipment manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<p>Positive and indeterminate COVID-19 test results should be reported to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> as soon as they are available from the test device and, at the latest, within 24 hours, which is the statutory requirement.</p>

<p>Negative and void COVID-19 test results, and positive, indeterminate, negative and void influenza test results, can be sent to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> within 7 days of testing.</p>

<h4>Laboratories</h4>

<p>There is a legal requirement for laboratories to report positive, negative, inconclusive (indeterminate) and void test results cases to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in accordance with public health legislation.</p>

<p>To support the reporting of the required infectious diseases, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has developed the Second Generation Surveillance System (<abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr>). This is the national surveillance system that holds all test results.</p>

<p>It is understood that laboratories may not have established systems to report results to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. However, there is a legal requirement to report. It is recommended that laboratories in this situation contact the <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> helpdesk on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:sgss.helpdesk@phe.gov.uk">sgss.helpdesk@phe.gov.uk</a> or the <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> COVID Incident Team on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:sgss.covidincident@phe.gov.uk">sgss.covidincident@phe.gov.uk</a> and they will put the laboratory in touch with the local <abbr title="Second Generation Surveillance System">SGSS</abbr> support team. Read the full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/notifiable-diseases-and-causative-organisms-how-to-report#reporting-of-sars-cov-2-test-results-to-public-health-england">Notifiable diseases and causative organisms: how to report</a>.</p>

<p>Laboratories are legally required to report the following information to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, insofar as the laboratory has this information.</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>home address (including postcode) or alternative address if not home address</li>
  <li>contact telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for positive or indeterminate  results)</li>
  <li>contact email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for positive or indeterminate  results)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample taken date and time</li>
  <li>date and time sample was received by lab</li>
  <li>details of causative agent</li>
  <li>the result of any antimicrobial susceptibility test and any resistance mechanism identified in respect of the sample</li>
  <li>sample type</li>
  <li>test method (for example <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>result (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>name of laboratory</li>
  <li>address of laboratory</li>
  <li>name, address and organisation of the person who solicited the test</li>
</ul>

<p>Laboratories should ensure they receive all relevant information from the provider to ensure accurate reporting.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If laboratories do not have this data, they should request the missing data from the provider who solicited the test, as it helps to break down the transmission of COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the legally required information outlined above, laboratories should also provide the following fields, insofar as the laboratory has this information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sample number/specimen ID – the format of the specimen must be as follows: ‘Reporting Laboratory Shortcode’ (the laboratory shortcode is the code provided by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) – ‘sample ID’ (this should be unique regardless of test method).
