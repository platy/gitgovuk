<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>New international travel testing requirements</h3>

<p>Everyone entering England from abroad must take one or more tests for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Travellers will be required to take a test either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on or before day 2 only</li>
  <li>on or before day 2 and on or after day 8</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different rules for people who have been in a country on the red list during the 10 days before they arrive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Read an overview of the rules for travelling to England from abroad and find out who needs to take which tests</a></p>

<p>This guidance sets out the minimum standards that private providers must meet when offering Test to Release for people arriving in England.</p>

<p>There are different minimum standards, with separate guidance, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 2 lateral flow tests for international arrivals – valid for travellers who arrive in England after 4am on 9th January</li>
  <li>day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for international arrivals</li>
  <li>general population COVID-19 testing for people without symptoms (domestic asymptomatic).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access all these guidance pages from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/minimum-standards-for-private-sector-providers-of-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">Minimum standards for private sector providers of COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<h3>Test to Release for international arrivals requirements</h3>

<p>Travellers can take an extra test to leave quarantine early using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel">Test to Release scheme for international travel</a> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are arriving in England from a country that is not on the red list</li>
  <li>they are not fully vaccinated</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Read the rules on who must quarantine when they enter England from abroad</a></p>

<p>By law, all testing services used for the purpose of shortening the quarantine period for international arrivals must meet certain minimum standards. The standards for the Test to Release scheme for international arrivals are outlined below.</p>

<h3>Red list arrivals</h3>

<p>All travellers who’ve been in a red list country in the 10 days before they arrive in England must quarantine for 10 full days in government-managed facilities. They cannot opt in to the Test to Release scheme for international travel.</p>

<p>It is important that Test to Release providers place warnings on their booking page to highlight that people who’ve been in a red list country in the 10 days before they arrive in England cannot use the Test to Release scheme.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">Read guidance for people arriving from red list countries</a></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>Self-declaration</h2>

<p>Providers must <a href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/PrivateSectorSelfDeclaration" rel="external" class="govuk-link">complete a self-declaration form</a> stating that their tests meet all of these standards.</p>

<p>As well as declaring that they meet the minimum standards at the start of the service, they must maintain these standards.</p>

<p>Any organisation involved in manufacturing, selling and reporting testing services will not be able to sell tests until the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has written to the provider that is self-declaring to confirm that the testing service meets the standard.</p>
</div>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/PrivateSectorSelfDeclaration" class="govuk-link">Start the private sector provider self-declaration process</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">See the list of successful self-declared private providers of COVID-19 testing</a></p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>UKAS accreditation and the GOV.UK lists</h2>

<p>Providers that have completed their self-declaration, and that have been successfully assessed against the relevant minimum standards and have received confirmation in writing can choose to be included in the GOV.UK list of providers for the testing service they offer.</p>

<p>For more information and guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit the <a href="https://www.ukas.com/find-an-organisation/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">UKAS website</a>
</li>
  <li>read government guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-become-a-private-provider-of-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">how to become a private provider of COVID-19 testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Penalties and offences</h2>

<p>If a private provider does not meet the standards required they may be committing an offence and subject to enforcement action and the resultant penalty.</p>

<h2>Problems with test kits and results</h2>

<p>Where a test kit is broken, is not delivered or gives an inconclusive or invalid test result, the provider should offer a replacement kit to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards that apply to Test to Release for international arrivals</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>In this guidance, when we talk about ‘eligible’ arrivals, we mean those who are eligible to follow the rules for people who have been fully vaccinated under an approved vaccination programme.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Requirement for a medical director and clinical scientist</h3>

<p>The provider of the test must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical issues. The individual must be a registered medical practitioner ‒ registered with the General Medical Council.</p>

<p>The provider must also have a designated resourced role that has oversight of clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting clinical issues. The individual must be a registered clinical scientist, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. The same individual may fulfil both roles (medical and clinical), providing they are duly registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Requirement for effective system of clinical governance</h3>

<p>The provider of the test must have an effective system of clinical governance in place, which includes appropriate standard operating procedures in relation to the carrying out of the tests being provided for ‘Test to Release for international travel’.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear governance and lines of accountability such as senior responsible officer, clinical lead, quality lead, training lead</li>
  <li>staff are appropriately trained and there is evidence of competency assessment and participation in relevant external quality assessment (EQA)</li>
  <li>liability and indemnity cover for staff</li>
  <li>for laboratory testing, a verification report for the laboratory element of the test (known as the assay), in line with national protocols (for laboratory-based testing)</li>
  <li>information management systems to monitor sample delivery and tracking</li>
  <li>systems to meet the provisions for handling, transportation and analysis of test samples</li>
  <li>for laboratory testing, working to containment level CL3 or CL2+ with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) approval</li>
  <li>systems, processes and record management to support the delivery of safe and reliable service</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> The test device must be permitted to be put into service in accordance with part 4 of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, other than solely by virtue of regulation 39(2) of those regulations</h3>

<p>This requirement is to ensure that testing devices used in relation to ‘Test to Release for international travel’ have a CE marking (or, following the UK’s exit from the European Union, a UK marking) and do not benefit from a derogation from those standards.</p>

<p>A CE mark is a logo that is placed on IVD medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC. A CE mark shows that the testing device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety.</p>

<p>A test with a UKCA mark can be used. Tests with a CE mark can be used until 30 June 2023.</p>

<p>Further information is available on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking" class="govuk-link">CE marking</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking">UKCA marking</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/in-vitro-diagnostic-medical-devices-guidance-on-legislation" class="govuk-link">in-vitro diagnostic medical devices</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Use of tests that meet minimum performance characteristics</h3>

<p>The provider must use test devices that use an established molecular detection method and have the following performance characteristics as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sensitivity greater than or equal to 95% (or a 95% 2-sided confidence interval entirely above 90%)</li>
  <li>specificity greater than or equal to 97% (or a 95% 2-sided confidence interval entirely above 95%)</li>
  <li>limit of detection less or equal to 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 copies per millilitre (≤1000 copies/ml)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, test devices must have been independently validated as having the required sensitivity and specificity using at least 150 positive clinical samples and 250 negative clinical samples against a laboratory-based RT-PCR test that is itself within the performance specification of the target product profile published by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for laboratory-based SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests.</p>

<p>Independent validation must have been conducted, no more than 18 months before the test is provided, by one of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an independent lab which is accredited by UKAS to ISO 15189 or 17025</li>
  <li>a scientific committee which is overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care, including the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/coronavirus-covid-19-serology-and-viral-detection-testing-uk-procurement-overview" class="govuk-link">Technologies Validation Group</a> or the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/protocol-for-evaluation-of-rapid-diagnostic-assays-for-specific-sars-cov-2-antigens-lateral-flow-devices" class="govuk-link">Lateral Flow Device Oversight Group</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/target-product-profile-antibody-tests-to-help-determine-if-people-have-recent-infection-to-sars-cov-2-version-2">Further guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work has been published by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Use of age-appropriate test devices</h3>

<p>The test device should be age-appropriate, so it must be suitable to administer or provide a test to a person of the same age as the international arrival.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Reporting of coronavirus test results, as a notifiable disease</h3>

<p>The provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, negative and inconclusive test results cases in accordance with their obligations under public health legislation.</p>

<p>More information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/739854/PHE_Laboratory_Reporting_Guidelines.pdf">guidance for reporting notifiable diseases</a>.</p>

<p>At booking, the provider (or sub-contractor, if relevant) must, therefore, collect the following data fields from international arrivals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>NHS number (if known and applicable)</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>home address, including postcode, and the address at which they intend to self-isolate (if different)</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>telephone number</li>
  <li>COVID-19 vaccination status</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with data required to be reported under <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/739854/PHE_Laboratory_Reporting_Guidelines.pdf" class="govuk-link">public health legislation</a>, the provider (or their subcontractor, if relevant) will need to have a system in place to collect from the international arrival and report the following additional data fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date of their arrival in the UK</li>
  <li>their coach number, flight number or vessel name (as appropriate)</li>
  <li>the date on which they arrived in England from country or territory outside of the Common Travel Area</li>
  <li>the country or territory they were travelling from when they arrived in the UK, and any country or territory they transited through as part of that journey</li>
  <li>COVID-19 vaccination status</li>
  <li>test reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the provider must collect the international arrivals’ passport number (or travel document or ID card reference number), and include this information on the notification of result, and confirm this to the police upon request.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Relevant systems in place to report adverse test incidents</h3>

<p>The provider must be able to demonstrate that it has systems in place to identify any adverse incidents or quality control issues in respect of the test device and be able to report them in a timely manner to the relevant regulatory body. MHRA has a dedicated COVID-19 Yellow Card portal to report adverse incidents with medicines, medical devices and diagnostics.</p>

<p>For more information, go to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/coronavirus-covid-19-new-dedicated-yellow-card-reporting-site-for-medicines-and-medical-devices" class="govuk-link">MHRA COVID-19 Yellow Card portal</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> For lab-based testing</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Providers must be or use a UKAS applicant laboratory to either ISO 15189 (Medical Laboratories – requirements for quality and competence) or ISO/IEC 17025 (General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, samples must be taken by a provider (or sub-contractor, if relevant) applicant to ISO standard ISO15189 or ISO/IEC17025. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>UKAS (UK Accreditation Service) accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of laboratories. This accreditation is an important element in establishing and maintaining confidence in a testing service.</p>

<p>For polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other lab-based testing, all samples must be processed by a UKAS applicant laboratory (the laboratory has applied for UKAS accreditation but has not yet achieved it) and have quality management systems operating according to ISO 15189 and/or ISO/IEC 17025. Samples must also be taken by or under the instruction of, a provider (and their sub-contractors, if relevant) that is applicant to ISO 15189 and/ or ISO/IEC 17025. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</p>

<p>UKAS appraisal status (‘stage 2’) will become mandatory for providers of ‘Test to Release for international travel’ (or their sub-contractors, if relevant) and commercial providers COVID-19 testing on 4 weeks after they become a UKAS applicant. UKAS appraisal status is an assessment of compliance with the requirements published by UKAS in relation to the relevant ISO standard.</p>

<p>UKAS accreditation (‘stage 3’), which is full accreditation to the relevant ISO standard, needs the provider to receive a positive recommendation from UKAS within 4 months of completing stage 2 (the date the organisation submitted evidence to UKAS showing compliance with the UKAS appraisal requirements) and achieve full accreditation within 6 months after completing stage 2 UKAS appraisal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> For point of care testing: providers must be applicant to ISO 15189 and 22870 (point-of-care testing – requirements for quality and competence)</h3>

<p>UKAS accreditation provides confidence in the competence, impartiality and integrity of point of care test providers to provide a safe and reliable point of care testing service.</p>

<p>For point of care testing, all providers (or sub-contractors, if relevant) must be applicant to ISO 15189 and 22870.
Providers are encouraged to adhere to <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/73506.html">ISO 22583 guidance for supervisors and operators of point-of-care testing devices</a>.</p>

<p>UKAS appraisal status (‘stage 2’) will become mandatory for providers of point of care tests for ‘Test to Release for international travel’ (or their sub-contractors, if relevant) and commercial providers COVID-19 testing 4 weeks after they become a UKAS applicant. UKAS appraisal status is an assessment of compliance with the requirements published by UKAS in relation to the relevant ISO standard.</p>

<p>UKAS accreditation (‘stage 3’), which is full accreditation to the relevant ISO standard, needs the provider to receive a positive recommendation from UKAS within 4 month of completing stage 2 (the date the organisation submitted evidence to UKAS showing compliance with the UKAS appraisal requirements) and achieve full accreditation within 6 months after completing stage 2 UKAS appraisal.</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> Date tests can be provided or administered</h3>

<p>Providers may only provide or administer tests to international arrivals on or after the fifth full day after the day on which the traveller arrives. The provider should base the day of arrival on the day the international arrivals declares on their booking form, meaning that the day of arrival is day 0.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> Reference number</h3>

<p>At the time the test is booked the test provider must provide a test reference number to the person booking the test.</p>

<p>If the provider sells multiple tests to one person, each test will require its own booking reference.</p>

<p>The booking reference must be in the required format which the provider must provide to UKHSA at the point of on-boarding.</p>

<p>Providers must only issue a booking reference to a customer once payment has been taken.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span> Sub-contractors</h3>

<p>If the test provider arranges with another provider or person (for example a sub-contractor) to carry out any element of the single end-to-end testing service on their behalf, the test provider must ensure that such person complies with the following requirements, as relevant to the carrying out of that element of the service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>requirement for a medical director and clinical scientist (standard 1)</li>
  <li>requirement for system of clinical governance (standard 2)</li>
  <li>requirement to report data to UKHSA (standard 6)</li>
  <li>requirement for systems in place to report issues (standard 7)</li>
  <li>requirement to be an applicant, to have reached appraisal status or to be accredited to the relevant ISO standard (standard 8, 9)</li>
  <li>requirement to not administer the test before the end of the fourth day after the traveller has departed from a non-exempt country (standard 10)</li>
  <li>requirement to provide results within 24 hours and in a set format (standard 13)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> Notification of test result: providers must issue the result of tests in a set notification which instructs the international arrival on whether they are required to self-isolate</h3>

<p>Test providers must notify the international arrival taking the test within 24 hours of their result becoming available by email, text message, letter or secure web portal. Providers must issue test results in a set notification, to ensure that the international arrival receives the relevant public health advice and notifications are recognisable.</p>

<p>The set format must include the international arrival’s name and date of birth and passport or ID card number, as provided at booking, the name and contact details of the test provider and the reference number for the test.
