<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>New international travel testing requirements</h3>

<p>Everyone entering England from abroad must take one or more tests for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Travellers will be required to take a test either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on or before day 2 only</li>
  <li>on or before day 2 and on or after day 8</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different rules for people who’ve been in a country on the red list during the 10 days before they arrive.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Read an overview of the rules for travelling to England from abroad and find out who needs to take which tests</a></p>

<p>This guidance sets out the minimum standards that private providers must meet when offering day 2 lateral flow tests from 4am on 7 January.</p>

<p>The day 2 lateral flow tests described in this guidance are not for arrivals from red list countries or unvaccinated travellers. Providers must not sell these tests to people who have been in a red list country in the 10 days before arriving in England or to travellers who have not been fully vaccinated.
There are different minimum standards, with separate guidance, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and day 2 and day 8 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>  tests for international arrivals</li>
  <li>the Test to Release scheme for international travel</li>
  <li>general population COVID-19 testing for people without symptoms (domestic asymptomatic)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access all these guidance pages from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/minimum-standards-for-private-sector-providers-of-covid-19-testing">minimum standards for private sector providers of COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<h2>Self-declaration</h2>

<p>Providers must complete a <a rel="external" href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/LFDday2" class="govuk-link">self-declaration form</a> stating that their tests meet all of these standards.</p>

<p>As well as declaring that they meet the minimum standards at the start of the service, they must maintain these standards.</p>

<p>This self-declaration must only be completed by front-end providers who will be directly selling day 2 lateral flow tests for mandatory COVID-19 testing for international arrivals who are eligible to follow the rules for fully vaccinated individuals.</p>

<p>The providers completing the self-declaration will self-declare on behalf of themselves and all of the organisations they’re working with to provide these tests. They will need to list all organisations that they will be working with (whether by subcontract or otherwise) in order to carry out this service.</p>

<p>Any organisation, excluding postal and courier organisations who are only carrying out collection, courier or delivery services will not be able to sell tests until the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) has written to the provider that is self-declaring to confirm that the testing service meets the standard.</p>

<p>If there is a change to any information submitted in their self-declaration, the provider will need to notify the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) of the nature of the new arrangement.</p>

<p>Start the self-declaration process.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">See the list of successful self-declared private providers of COVID-19 testing.</a></p>

<h3>
<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation and the GOV.UK lists</h3>

<p>Providers that have completed their self-declaration, and that have been successfully assessed against the relevant minimum standards and have received confirmation in writing can choose to be included in the GOV.UK list of providers for the testing service they offer.</p>

<p>For more information and guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit the <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</li>
  <li>read government guidance on how to become a private provider of COVID-19 testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Penalties and offences</h2>

<p>If a private provider does not meet the standards required, they may be committing an offence and subject to enforcement action and the resultant penalty.</p>

<h2>Problems with test kits and results</h2>

<p>Where a test kit is broken, is not delivered or gives an inconclusive or invalid test result, the provider should offer a replacement kit as soon as possible to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards that apply to day 2 lateral flow tests</h2>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>In this guidance, when we talk about ‘eligible’ arrivals, we mean those who are eligible to follow the rules for people who have been fully vaccinated under an approved vaccination programme.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Requirement for a medical director and clinical scientist</h3>

<p>The provider of the test must have a designated resourced role that has oversight and approval of medical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting medical issues. The individual must be a registered medical practitioner, registered with the General Medical Council.</p>

<p>The provider must also have a designated resourced role that has oversight of clinical practices undertaken by the provider and responsibility for reporting clinical issues. The individual must be a registered clinical scientist, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. The same individual may fulfil both roles (medical and clinical), providing they are duly registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Requirement for effective system of clinical governance</h3>

<p>The provider of the test must have an effective system of clinical governance in place, which includes appropriate standard operating procedures in relation to the carrying out of the tests being provided for mandatory day 2 lateral flow testing for eligible international arrivals.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear governance and lines of accountability such as senior responsible officer, clinical lead, quality lead, training lead</li>
  <li>staff are appropriately trained and there is evidence of competency assessment and participation in relevant external quality assessment (<abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>liability and indemnity cover for staff</li>
  <li>information management systems to monitor sample delivery and tracking</li>
  <li>systems to meet the provisions for handling, transportation and analysis of test samples</li>
  <li>systems, processes and record management to support the delivery of safe and reliable service</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> The test device must be an approved lateral flow device which is permitted to be put into service in accordance with part 4 of the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, other than solely by virtue of regulation 39(2) of those regulations</h3>

<p>This requirement is to ensure that the testing device has a CE marking (or, following the UK’s exit from the European Union, a UK marking) and does not benefit from a derogation from those standards.</p>

<p>A CE mark is a logo that is placed on an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical device to show that it conforms to the requirements of the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC.</p>

<p>A CE mark shows that the testing device is fit for its intended purpose stated and meets legislative requirements relating to safety. Tests with a CE mark can be used until 30 June 2023.</p>

<p>Alternatively a test with a <abbr title="UK Conformity Assessed">UKCA</abbr> mark can be used.</p>

<p>The word ‘approved’ relates to a process by which coronavirus test devices must be approved by the Secretary of State at the time that it is provided/dispatched to the international arrival. This is under regulation 34A of the Medical Devices Regulations, which was inserted into Part 4 by the Medical Devices (Coronavirus Test Device Approvals) (Amendment) Regulations 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Alignment to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> target product profile scope and the test must be supplied in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for use</h3>

<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has published target product profiles (<abbr title="target product profiles">TPPs</abbr>) for different types of test, setting out the ‘scope’ of what that test should be used for, including target use, target user and target use settings.</p>

<p>The provider must declare that they’re using the test in line with its published scope. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has set out guidance explaining how both virus and antibody tests work.</p>

<p>The manufacturer’s instruction for use (<abbr title="instruction for use">IFU</abbr>) set out the target use, target user and target setting and seek to ensure that, for example, the tests which are being sent for self-administration at home are the right sort of tests for that purpose.</p>

<p>The manufacturer must demonstrate that they hold evidence to support the intended use as stated in their <abbr title="instruction for use">IFU</abbr>. For example, if the self-test may be used by a lay person to help another lay person take the test, they must have evidence to support this use scenario. The <abbr title="instruction for use">IFU</abbr> should make this clear and there should also be evidence of performance data to support their use in these situations.</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> The test must use either nasal swabbing (mid turbinate or anterior nares) and/or tonsillar swabbing or saliva, in accordance with the manufacturer’s <abbr title="instruction for use">IFU</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Where the international arrival self-administers the lateral flow test, the international arrival will be required to send their evidence of the test result for provider verification within 15 minutes of the read time of the test. These measures increase the overall reliability and user acceptance of the lateral flow test.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Each test device must be uniquely identifiable</h3>

<p>The provider must ensure that each test device that is sold is uniquely identifiable, and the provider must have a system in place to reject results from previously used devices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> The test result must be verified by the provider with, as a minimum, a single photographic evidence when the provider does not witness the test service (self-administered tests taken over video call still require photographic evidence)</h3>

<p>The provider is responsible for analysing and verifying the result and reporting it to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. The test result must be verified by the provider with, as a minimum, a single photographic evidence, when the test is self-administered meeting the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the lateral flow test device must be identifiable as the test provider’s</li>
  <li>the photograph must also show the international arrival’s unique test booking reference</li>
  <li>the result must be clearly visible</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Reporting of coronavirus test results, as a notifiable disease</h3>

<p>The provider must have a system in place for reporting positive, negative and inconclusive test results cases in accordance with their obligations under public health legislation. All results of tests for this purpose must be reported within 24 hours of them receiving evidence of the test result.</p>

<p>At booking, the provider (or subcontractor, if relevant) must have a system in place to collect the following data fields from international arrivals:</p>

<p>In relation to the person being tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>NHS number</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>home address (including postcode)</li>
  <li>the address provided to the test provider as the place where the international arrival is able to receive a confirmatory test</li>
  <li>telephone number (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
  <li>email address (only in the case of SARS-CoV-2 positive or indeterminate results)</li>
  <li>whether or not the individual has received a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2</li>
  <li>passport number or travel document number (as appropriate)</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with data required to be reported under public health legislation, the provider (or their subcontractor, if relevant) will need to have a system in place to collect from the international arrival and report the following additional data fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their coach number, flight number or vessel name (as appropriate)</li>
  <li>the date on which they last departed from or transited through a country or territory outside the common travel area</li>
  <li>the country or territory they were travelling from when they arrived in the UK, and any country or territory they transited through as part of that journey</li>
  <li>test booking reference</li>
  <li>the date of their arrival in the UK</li>
  <li>confirmation that the test complies, and was undertaken in accordance, with the requirements applicable under the International Travel and Operator Liability Regulations</li>
  <li>confirmation that the test is a lateral flow device test undertaken by an eligible traveller</li>
  <li>where the test provider did not administer sample collection services (that is, take the swab), the date and time that the test provider received evidence of the test result</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the test provider and a description of its operations</li>
  <li>test result code (such as COVID-19 +ve/-ve or influenza A +ve/-ve)</li>
  <li>specimen identification number</li>
  <li>specimen type</li>
  <li>specimen date</li>
  <li>date the test was performed</li>
  <li>test method (lateral flow test)</li>
  <li>name of the testing equipment manufacturer</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> Reporting test sales</h3>

<p>Each day the provider must complete a daily report that details total sales to travellers arriving into England on the day of report completion, including the number of tests they sold on that day.</p>

<p>The report must also include the following details in relation to each test sold on that day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date of the arrival in England of the person in respect of whom the test was sold</li>
  <li>the type of test used (lateral flow test)</li>
  <li>whether the purchase of the test has been cancelled</li>
  <li>the test reference number given to the person who bought the test</li>
</ul>

<p>Test sales should be reported by the traveller’s date of arrival in England. Providers must report whether tests sold are for eligible or non-eligible arrivals from countries not on the red list. Test providers must also provide the test booking references for the sale completed on that day.</p>

<p>This will need to be filled in by each customer-facing provider that is selling tests directly to international arrivals.</p>

<p>These reports must be submitted daily through a live form provided to testing providers who meet minimum standards.</p>

<p>This information will not be used for any commercial purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> Relevant systems in place to report adverse test incidents</h3>

<p>The provider must be able to demonstrate that it has systems in place to identify any adverse incidents or quality control issues in respect of the test device and be able to report them in a timely manner to the relevant regulatory body. <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has a dedicated COVID-19 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/coronavirus-covid-19-new-dedicated-yellow-card-reporting-site-for-medicines-and-medical-devices">Yellow Card portal</a> to report adverse incidents with medicines, medical devices and diagnostics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> Reference number format</h3>

<p>At the time the test is booked, the test provider must provide a single test reference number to the person booking the test. If the provider sells multiple tests to one person, each test will require its own booking reference.</p>

<p>The booking reference must be in the required format which the provider must provide to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> at the point of on-boarding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span> Issuance of booking reference</h3>

<p>Providers must only issue a booking reference to a customer once payment has been taken.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> Subcontractors or organisations you are working with</h3>

<p>If the test provider arranges with another provider or person (for example, a subcontractor) to carry out any element of the single end-to-end testing service on their behalf, the test provider must ensure that such person complies with the necessary requirements as relevant to the carrying out of that element of the service. This must result in the full end-to-end process meeting all the relevant minimum standards.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14. </span> Notification of test result: providers must issue the result of tests in a set notification which tells the person arriving from abroad whether they are required to quarantine</h3>

<h4>Form A: negative lateral flow test result</h4>

<p>Your COVID-19 test result is negative. You did not have the virus when the test was done.</p>

<p>You are not required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>You should self-isolate again if you get symptoms of COVID-19 – get an NHS COVID-19 test from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test</a> and self-isolate until you get the results.</p>

<p>For advice on when you might need to self-isolate and what to do, go to <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19</a> and read ‘Self-isolation and treating symptoms’.</p>

<h4>Form B – positive lateral flow test result</h4>

<p>Your coronavirus test result is positive. This means that you probably have the virus.</p>

<p>Even if you have not had symptoms of coronavirus you must now self-isolate for 10 days from the day after your test date.</p>

<p>You must obtain, take and return a free follow up polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test from NHS Test and Trace to confirm this. You can obtain your confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test by visiting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test</a> or by calling 119.</p>

<p>This test will be free of charge and will be sent to you as a home test kit.</p>

<p>You must take this test in accordance with this notice. If this confirmatory test is negative, you no longer need to self-isolate.</p>

<p>You may be contacted for contact tracing and to check that you, and those who you live or are travelling with, are self-isolating.</p>

<p>You must not travel, including to leave the UK, during self-isolation.</p>

<p>Contact 111 if you need medical help. In an emergency dial 999.</p>

<h4>Form C: unclear lateral flow test result</h4>

<p>Your coronavirus test result is unclear. It is not possible to say if you had the virus when the test was done.</p>

<p>You must self-isolate for 10 days from the day after your test date.</p>

<p>You may choose to take another test, and if it comes back with a negative result, you no longer need to self-isolate. You may be contacted to check that you are self-isolating.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15. </span> Confirm the address for the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>
</h3>

<p>When a person arriving from abroad gets a positive lateral flow test result, the provider must confirm with the traveller the address to which a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> must be sent, and report that address to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16. </span> Compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements, for sample collection, processing and sharing of results including the requirements of data protection legislation</h3>

<p>The Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>) has set out frequently asked questions (‘<abbr title="frequently asked questions">FAQs</abbr>’) on data collection and data protection relating to coronavirus (COVID-19) that provide further information, including <abbr title="general data protection regulation">GDPR</abbr> (general data protection regulation) considerations:</p>

However, you will want to take full account of the fact that the processing of an international arrival’s health data is subject to additional levels of protection by Article 9 of the <abbr title="general data protection regulation">GDPR</abbr> and can only be disclosed where it is necessary and proportionate for one of the specific purposes set out in that Article.</p>

<p>You are also reminded that you run a risk of breaching Article 5 of the <abbr title="general data protection regulation">GDPR</abbr> and the Data Protection Act 2018 and being subject to significant regulatory penalties if, having obtained health data from an international arrival under these standards, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retain that data for longer than is necessary in order to fulfil your role as a test provider operating in accordance with these standards</li>
  <li>process that data for a purpose that would be incompatible with the purpose for which the data was initially collected. Further processing the data for your own commercial or research objectives are examples of an incompatible purpose in these circumstances</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">19. </span> Provider accreditation requirements: Only required for organisations providing sample collection and/or point-of-care testing services. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Providers must be or use a United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) accredited or applicant point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>) provider ISO standards ISO 15189 and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71119.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">ISO 22870</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Samples must be taken by a provider (or subcontractor, if relevant) who is <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accredited or an applicant to ISO standard ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, providers are encouraged to adhere to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/73506.html" class="govuk-link" rel="external">ISO 22583</a> ‘Guidance for supervisors and operators of point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>) devices.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation provides an assurance of the competence, impartiality and integrity of providers. This accreditation is an important element in establishing and maintaining confidence in a testing service.</p>

<p>For point-of-care testing, providers need to meet ISO standards ISO 15189 and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71119.html">ISO 22870</a> ‘point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>) – requirements for quality and competence’. These ISO standards and technical specifications set out the key components that should be considered to provide safe and reliable <abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr> service. Providers are encouraged to adhere to <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/73506.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">ISO 22583</a> ‘Guidance for supervisors and operators of point-of-care testing (<abbr title="point-of-care testing">POCT</abbr>) devices’. Samples must also be taken by or under the written instruction of, a provider (and their subcontractors, if relevant) that is applicant to ISO 15189 or ISO/IEC 17025. This requirement does not prevent issue of tests which are self-swabbed or self-administered since those samples would be taken under written instruction from the person responsible for taking the samples.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal status (‘stage 2’) is mandatory for commercial providers of COVID-19 testing 4 weeks after they become a <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> applicant and have self-declared on the GOV.UK website confirming they meet minimum requirements. <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal status is an assessment of compliance with the minimum requirements published by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> for fulfilment of stage 2. <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation (‘stage 3’), which is full accreditation to the relevant ISO standard, requires the provider to receive a positive recommendation from <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> within 4 months of completing stage 2 (that is, the date on which the organisation submitted evidence to <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> demonstrating compliance with the <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal requirements) and achieve full accreditation within 6 months after completing stage 2 <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> appraisal.</p>
