<p>You need a permit under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 to discharge treated effluent from a waste water treatment works (<abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr>) to surface water or groundwater. Permits contain conditions that control the quality of the effluent you can discharge.</p>

<p>You may not be able to comply with your permit if you cannot get the chemicals you use to treat the effluent, to reduce phosphorus, you discharge because of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK’s new relationship with the EU</li>
  <li>coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
  <li>other unavoidable supply chain failures, for example the failure of a treatment chemical supplier</li>
</ul>

<p>This regulatory position statement (<abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>) does not alter your legal obligations under your permit or relevant legislation. However, if you follow the conditions in this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> the Environment Agency will not normally take enforcement action for discharging effluent in breach of the conditions in your permit.</p>

<p>You must get <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">written agreement</a> from your Environment Agency water company account manager before you use this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>When this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> applies</h2>

<p>This <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> only applies to water and sewerage company discharges from <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr> that cannot comply with permit conditions because of a shortage of chemicals to treat effluent due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK’s new relationship with the EU</li>
  <li>coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
  <li>other unavoidable failure in the supply chain</li>
</ul>

<p>You must demonstrate that you have taken all reasonable steps to comply with your permit. Reasonable steps include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contingency planning to avoid or minimise disruption to your business</li>
  <li>response planning to minimise the impact and duration of not complying with your permit</li>
</ul>

<p>This <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> does not apply to any other activity, even if it is under the same legislation. You may still need other permits or licences for other activities you carry out.</p>

<h2>Conditions you must comply with</h2>

<p>You must contact your Environment Agency water company account manager if you think you will not be able to comply with your permit. You must contact them when you have at least 2 weeks’ supply of chemicals left and you are unlikely to get enough further supplies.</p>

<p>You must prioritise using the chemicals you have, as far as is practicable, to treat the effluent at <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr> which have the greatest potential to cause environmental harm.</p>

<p>Contact your Environment Agency water company account manager to discuss how to prioritise using chemicals. Apply the joint Water UK and Environment Agency risk assessment. This is <a href="#contact" class="govuk-link">available from the Environment Agency</a>. The assessment identifies 3 categories of <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr>. Use one of these 3 categories for your <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: low risk – protecting discharges from these <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr> is less critical and likely to have low environmental and downstream abstraction impact</li>
  <li>B: medium risk – you should protect discharges from these <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr> for as long as possible</li>
  <li>C: high risk – it is critical you protect discharges from these <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr>, they are likely to have a high environmental or downstream abstraction impact</li>
</ul>

<p>You must give highest priority to using chemicals for category C <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr>.</p>

<p>You cannot use this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> for discharges from category C <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr> because the risk is too great.</p>

<p>Contact your water company account manager if your chemical supplies will not adequately treat all category C <abbr title="waste water treatment works">WwTW</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must resume use of chemicals to treat effluent as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p>You must comply with all the other requirements of your environmental permit.</p>

<p>You must keep records that show why you needed to use this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>. For example, records of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff absences</li>
  <li>contractors being unavailable</li>
  <li>supply chain failures</li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep these records for 2 years after this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> has expired, including any extensions to it. You must make them available to the Environment Agency on request.</p>

<p>You must make sure your activities do not endanger human health or the environment.</p>

<p>You must make sure that your discharge does not cause or risk causing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significant environmental damage, including causing environmental damage as defined by the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (England) Regulations 2015</li>
  <li>significant pollution or significant harm to water, air, soil, plants or animals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enforcement</h2>

<p>An <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> means that the Environment Agency will not normally take enforcement action against you provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your activity meets the description set out in this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you comply with the conditions set out in this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>your activity does not, and is not likely to, cause environmental pollution or harm human health</li>
  <li>you have taken all reasonable steps to comply with your permit</li>
</ul>

<p>If you operate under this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>, but think you may no longer be able to comply with its conditions, you must tell the Environment Agency immediately.</p>

<h2>When to check back</h2>

<p>We will withdraw this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> on 31 December 2021 unless we extend it. After this date you must have a permit that authorises the activity covered by this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr> or stop the activity.</p>

<h2>Contact the Environment Agency</h2>

<p>Contact your water company account manager to get written agreement to use this <abbr title="regulatory position statement">RPS</abbr>.</p>
