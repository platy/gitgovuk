<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Chapter 1: Key points</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Malaysia and who can help.  A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody.  We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Contacting us</h3>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Consulate (and must do so if you want them to)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Consulate even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested.  This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Who we are</h3>

<p>You can contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on +44 (0) 20 7008 5000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgmental help. Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you. We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>When a British National is arrested and detained in Malaysia, the Malaysian authorities must inform the British High Commission. This is done formally in writing through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and can take two to three days to reach us. In certain cases it can take up to 21 days or longer. We may be informed quicker over the phone by friends or relations, by the arresting officer, or, exceptionally, by the prison social worker.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide a list of local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-malaysia">English-speaking lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malaysia-list-of-translators-interpreters">interpreters</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called Prisoners Abroad</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities on mistreatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services are not available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>What we can’t do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>First steps</h3>

<h4>Can you / will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have.  For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Will the UK Police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Malaysia.</p>

<h4>Do I need a lawyer?  / How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British. However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>Who else can help me?</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Malaysia</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>You are generally allowed a 45 minute visit from friends and family, depending on which prison or detention facility you are held in. Visit regulations for family and friends visits may vary from prison to prison, or from one detention facility to another.</p>

<p>You may be allowed extra or longer visits for special or compassionate reasons (for example, distance) Requests for longer visits at a prison have to be make with the Prison Head Office before each visit. Requests for longer visits at a detention facility has to be made with the facility’s Records Office.</p>

<p>For certain prisons, your family or friends will be able to make a request for visits directly through the prison themselves. They will need to make a call to the prison’s registration counter and request for a visit.  Alternatively, requests for these visits can be made through us. Your family or friends can inform us about their visits before travelling. We will forward the requests to the Prison Head Office or detention facility’s Record Office for a longer visit.</p>

<p>Frequency of visits allowed may vary at different stages of your trial/prison sentence, from prison to prison, or from one detention facility to another. We can enquire and clarify with the authorities, on your behalf.</p>

<h4>What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>In most prisons, visits will be made in a communal meeting area separated by booths. The meeting will take place behind solid glass, with a telephone on each side to facilitate communication. The telephone connection is timed, and will automatically shut off without warning once the allocated time has lapsed. Depending on the prison, a prison guard may or may not be in the vicinity on either side during the interaction.</p>

<p>Visitors must bring along their original identification document (e.g. passport) when visiting, as they must identify themselves upon arrival at the prison. This identification document will be held by the prison, your visitors will then be issued with a pass. Your visitor’s identification document will be returned to them at the end of the visit.</p>

<h4>What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Visitors are allowed to bring reading materials for you, however these reading materials will be subjected to security checks by the authorities at the prison or detention facility.</p>

<p>Visitors are not permitted to bring in any food items and other articles from outside, unless otherwise authorised by the Records Office and it is subject to approval from the Prison Director. All toiletries and some items (for example, soap, toothpaste, shorts, white T-shirt or face towels) are not permitted to be brought in by your visitors, and have to be purchased from the prison canteen. It is possible for a Consular Representative to bring in prison comforts. Items requested are also subject to approval from the Prison Director.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>We will offer to contact your family or next-of-kin to tell them the situation. With your consent, we can give them advice on prison procedures, regulations, your morale and how you are doing. We can also pass on any messages from you. You can write to us at any time on matters of concern.</p>

<p>If you are detained or on remand we aim to visit you as required in order to monitor your welfare, with a possibility of more frequent visits in the immediate period after your arrest.</p>

<p>After sentencing, we aim to visit you once every 6 months, unless there are reasons to visit you more frequently.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern, but if it is urgent it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf.</p>

<h4>Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>In the event of an urgent situation such as the funeral or critical illness of your next-of-kin, it may be possible to apply for a trip outside of prison under exceptional circumstances. This would apply only for prisoners with higher clearances (blue suits, etc.) and only for domestic journeys within Malaysia. Any decision on the matter will have to be cleared by the prison authorities in advance of the trip.
 
### Police custody and initial arrival at prison</p>

<h4>Arrival at the police station and basic rights</h4>

<p>Investigation begins before a charge is brought against you, in order to determine if there is any or enough evidence, which can sustain the charge.</p>

<p>When the police are investigating a case and think you have information or knowledge about the case, the police may question you and take down your response (112 Statement). Most times, the police will make an informal request that you give a 112 Statement. Please seek legal advice if you have been asked to give a 112 Statement.</p>

<p>When giving a 112 Statement, you have the right to ask a lawyer to accompany you. You may refuse to answer any question or remain silent if the answer is likely to expose you to a criminal offence. Check your 112 Statement to ensure that the information recorded is as accurate as you have conveyed, before signing the Statement.</p>

<p>Any enforcement authority, with power of arrest, may search any property entered by the person sought to be arrested and may enter the property by force if refused entry.</p>

<p>You may be searched and any articles found, which are reasonably believed to be evidence of the crime may be confiscated, until your release. Any offensive weapon found on you may be seized.</p>

<p>If you are unable to give a reasonable account of your identity, the police and other enforcement authority may search you to ascertain your name and your address.</p>

<h4>Appearance at court</h4>

<p>If you are detained by the police for longer than 48 hours, you will be brought to court for an extension to police remand for up to 14 days. The police officer investigating your case will need to justify to the judge that they need to detain you longer for further investigation.</p>

<p>You will be required to speak when the police brings you to court to charge you for an offence. When the charge has been read out to you, you will be asked as to whether you understand the charge levied against you, and you are then required to enter into a plea of guilty or not guilty to the charge.</p>

<p>Some courts in Malaysia conduct proceedings in Bahasa Malaysia (Malay language) and some may conduct proceedings in English. You can request for interpreters.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to have legal representation with you during your court attendances.</p>

<p>More information about the Malaysian judicial system can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#chapter-3-the-malaysian-judicial-system">Chapter 3</a>.
 
#### Initial arrival at the prison</p>

<p>If you are sentenced to imprisonment or are remanded awaiting trial, you will be sent to a prison. When you arrive into prison, any personal items you have will be taken off you and kept safe. Your details will be entered in the system, and you will be given a unique body reference number. You will then be given a uniform.</p>

<p>You will not be allowed visitors until you have completed the initial quarantine on arrival. This is a standard procedure for all prisons to prevent the spread of disease, and you will generally be quarantined for 14 days.
 
### Prison: conditions and daily life</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>You do not have the right to a single cell. Only prisoners who are sentenced with the death penalty have right to a single cell. Overcrowding is a problem in Malaysian prisons. Often you will be placed in a shared cell with others.</p>

<p>You may be given a mattress to sleep on the floor, although this may be unavailable in some prisons. There is usually a squat toilet in the cell itself.</p>

<p>Normally, unless otherwise specified by the prison authorities, you will be with the general population of the prison block. However, upon your return to court (for example, court hearings or trials), you will be placed in quarantine for up to 14 days. During this period, you will not be allowed any visitors and may have limited access to prison facilities. Once this period ends, you will return to your usual prison block.</p>

<p>If detained for Immigration offences, you may be detained in an immigration deportation centre or holding area. Conditions in these camps can be very basic and crowded.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>You will be provided 3 meals a day. The prison authorities have assured the British High Commission that the food they provide is a balanced diet giving the necessary daily nutritional requirements. This is in line with the Prison Regulations 2000. A special diet, based on medical grounds, can only be approved when the prison medical officer has given his authority. The prisons have separate menu for vegetarians.</p>

<p>You are able to purchase additional meals from the prison canteen.  The costs of the additional meals will be deducted from your prison account.</p>

<p>In some facilities, boiled drinking water is sent every day to the cells in large containers for the cell to share amongst themselves. Some facilities will only have water straight from the tap. Tap water in Malaysia is generally potable, but will have a strong chemical taste due to chlorination.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Bathing facilities are communal and located within your cell. All toilets in the cell will be squat toilets. Toiletries are not provided on arrival. However, you will be able to purchase toiletries at the prison shop with the funds in your prison account.</p>

<h4>Work and study</h4>

<p>Prisoners may work if certified fit by the Prison Medical Officer. The prison will determine the job or vocational training most suited for you, based on your sentences and interests, and the prison capacity and resources. If you wish to work and it is practical, safe and suitable, you may be employed and paid a wage by the prison as determined by the Prisons Regulations 2000.</p>

<p>You will be permitted to spend up to two thirds of your monthly earnings to purchase necessities (e.g. toiletries) for you own use.</p>

<p>The balance of your earnings will be placed in your prisoner account and the total credit will be paid to you upon release or part of the earnings sent to your family.</p>

<p>Not many prisons offer study courses, and even then only for long-term prisoners. You may wish to approach the welfare officer to enquire on whether these are available at the prison.</p>

<h4>Contact and languages</h4>

<p>Depending on capacity, some prisons do put foreign national prisoners together within the same block or cell. However, their proficiency in English may be limited. Orders issued by the prison guards will usually be in Malay.</p>

<p>Whilst on remand in a police lock-up or a detention facility, generally you are not permitted to make telephone calls. Police officers may have the discretion to allow you to make telephone calls, but this is however on case-by-case basis. You can also ask the police officers to contact the High Commission or to inform your next-of-kin, on your behalf.</p>

<p>Internet access is not allowed except for certain prisoners with higher clearance such as Blue Suits, and with the explicit authorisation of the prison.</p>

<p>Once sentenced and imprisoned, you are permitted to register up to 5 contact telephone numbers on your prison record. You are able to purchase telephone cards from the prison canteen, and with the telephone card, you can request to contact any of the 5 registered numbers.</p>

<p>You may receive reading materials from your family or friends, but this is subject to checks and possible censorship by the prison authorities. Some prisons or detention centres may also have a library, where you are allowed to have library books and to exchange them as often as practicable. The library can however be limited.</p>

<p>You may have the use of books and writing materials received or secured through the prison officer with the permission and approval of the prison authorities.</p>

<p>Any religious books or articles recognised for your denomination and personal use are acceptable for prison use.</p>

<p>There is the possibility to request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>Daily exercise and physical recreated is allowed under Prison Regulations, provided that security and discipline is maintained by the prisoner.</p>

<p>However, exercise may not be possible if the prison is under COVID-19 rules to prevent outbreaks.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>

<p>Malaysia has a tropical climate with consistent temperatures year-round of between 25 degrees to 35 degrees, with a noticeable dry and wet season depending on monsoon winds. Temperatures are typically warmer during the dry season and cooler during the wet season. High humidity levels of around 60 to near 100% is prevalent year-round due to the tropical climate.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>Bibles are usually allowed through the censors, and Qurans are available through the Welfare Officer as well, although English translations may not be available.</p>

<p>If you wish to meet with any religious personnel from the Government Department or members of religious associations, you can seek for assistance from the Record Office. However, they have the right to object to the visit or stop this service at any time for security purposes.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>According to Prison Regulations, prison rules on the treatment and conduct of prisoners are explained to the prisoner within 24 hours of arrival and then once every three months thereafter.</p>

<p>In addition to shouting, physical punishment such as beatings may be utilised by the prison guards as part of disciplinary measures while in prison.</p>

<p>Prison guards exercise great authority within prison walls and expect to be treated with deference and respect. They would expect to be addressed as “Tuan” or Sir (if male) and “Puan” or Ma’am (if female).</p>

<p>It is considered as an aggravated prison offence if you are caught in possession, in custody, in control, abusing or distributing any dangerous drugs or substance. If you are caught and found guilty of an aggravated prison offence, the prison authorities may punish you with one or more punishment. This includes reprimand, forfeiture of privileges, and reduction of earnings or separate confinement.</p>

<p>If you are subjected to forms of mistreatment such as beatings during your time in detention, you have the option of letting us know as soon as possible through your lawyer or directly to the High Commission. Once contacted, we will aim to make a visit to you as soon as possible to check on your welfare, and should you wish to, can raise the matter with the prison authorities on your behalf. However, if you do not feel safe to raise the matter during your detention, please let us know and we will follow the matter up with you after your release.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are two ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends. We will be able to discuss with your family or friends on how to transfer funds to you directly in prison, or through the Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prisoners Abroad: Depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO to arrange this.</p>

<p>We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<p>As a result of COVID restrictions, certain prisons in Malaysia now have the facility to accept money directly from family members. You may wish to ask the prison’s front desk for more information on how to transfer funds directly to prison.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources.</p>

<h4>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, Malaysia is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met. Malaysia has a universal healthcare system, and basic healthcare is provided in prisons without additional charges.</p>

<p>Each prison has a resident Medical Officer who may attend the prison daily. If you are sick, inform the prison guards immediately, who will arrange the Medical Officer to examine you. The medical officer will then report to the prison’s Record Office if they think that it is necessary to recommend further treatment or prescribe additional medications to you.</p>

<p>In case of serious illness in which there are inadequate facilities for your treatment, the prison may transfer you to a government hospital, accompanied with the referral certificate of the medical officer.</p>

<p>If you need dental care, you should inform the prison who can arrange a dentist to visit you.</p>

<p>Some prisons offer counselling services to those who are experiencing psychological distress. Please speak to the Welfare Officer for more information on counselling services available.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor.  We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>Mail/parcels</h4>

<p>You may be able to send or receive mail whilst in prison. Your letters will be subject to inspection by the prison authorities, and the clearance for delivery is at the discretion of the prison.</p>

<p>Mail can also be delivered through the High Commission, but are also subject to inspection by the prison authorities.</p>

<p>If the prison authorities have deemed that the contents of your outgoing letters are inappropriate, they will give you an opportunity to rewrite your letter. If the prison authorities find that the content of a letter sent to you inappropriate, the letter in question will either be returned to sender or destroyed.</p>

<p>You cannot possess any unauthorised articles and if found, they will be confiscated by the prison authorities. Reading materials with explicit contents are not permitted in prison or detention centres.</p>

<p>If your visitors want to deposit certain articles during their visits (for example, money, clothing, food, drink, tobacco, letters, paper, book or tools), they must be approved by the prison authorities before the article can be given to you. The prison authorities reserve the right to refuse an article that is inconsistent with the prison regulations.</p>

<h4>Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>Whilst on remand in a police lock-up or a detention facility, generally you are not permitted to make telephone calls. Police officers may have the discretion to allow you to make telephone calls, but this is however on case-by-case basis. You can also ask the police officers to contact the High Commission or to inform your next-of-kin, on your behalf.</p>

<p>Once sentenced and imprisoned, you are permitted to register up to 5 contact telephone numbers on your prison record. You are able to purchase telephone cards from the prison canteen, and with the telephone card, you can request to contact any of the 5 registered numbers. Mobile phones are not permitted within prison, and anyone caught possessing one may be punished by the prison. Your personal mobile phone will be taken from you and kept along with your other belongings when first entering the prison.</p>

<h4>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>With your permission, we will request an official investigation to be conducted by the Prison Director into your report of mistreatment. We will provide you with update on the outcome of the prison authorities’ investigation.</p>

<p>Where possible we can request for you to be moved to a different block or detention facility. You may also want to consider seeking legal advice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Chapter 3: the Malaysian judicial system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>There are two types of trials in Malaysia; the civil and the criminal. The hierarchy of courts begin at Magistrates’ Court, Sessions Court, High Court, Court of Appeal, and Federal Court. The courts in Malaysia are presided over by magistrates or judges.</p>

<p>Malaysia also has a parallel system of Syariah Courts, which has some jurisdictions over matters of Islamic law such as family and religious law, and are only applicable on matters where both parties are Muslims.</p>

<p>Generally, the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) is applicable to any criminal arrests. When there is no specific provision made by this Code or by any other law and legislations, the English criminal procedures shall be applicable so far as the same rules do not conflict or are consistent with the CPC.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>An arrest occurs when a police officer informs you that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are arresting you; or</li>
  <li>They will be using force to stop you if you try to escape.</li>
</ul>

<p>The police officer must identify themselves by showing their authority card to you when arresting you. If the police officer is in plain clothes, they must state their authority very clearly.</p>

<p>When effecting arrest, the police must inform you of the grounds or reasons for your arrest. It could be classed as an unlawful arrest if you are not informed of the reason.</p>

<p>However, when a police officer stops a person only to make enquiries, it does not amount to an arrest. The police officer cannot compel you to answer any question but you may willingly give information.</p>

<p>After you are arrested, the police officer must inform you of your right to remain silent. If the police officer does not do so, any statement made by you cannot be used as evidence in court.</p>

<p>The Police may ask you to make a statement, and sign it as correct. All statements must be read back to you, in the language you understand. You must be satisfied the statement that you have given is recorded accurately. If you are not satisfied it is recorded accurately, or it has not been adequately translated to you, you should ask for a full translation before you sign it, making any corrections. It is also very important that the statement is made voluntarily. Any statement taken under inducement, threat or promise is not admissible in court.</p>

<p>*Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers is available.</p>

<h4>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>After you are arrested, the police must produce you before a Magistrate within 24 hours. The police must do so without any unnecessary delay. If you are arrested on a public holiday, you will be taken before a Magistrate on the next working day. You will remain in police custody until the police produces you before a Magistrate. You can request to be represented by a lawyer during the remand hearing.</p>

<p>A Magistrate is a judicial officer. The Magistrate has the power to decide whether you should be further remanded and remain in police custody for more than 24 hours. The remand period gives more time to the Police to complete their investigations and decide whether there is evidence to charge you for an offence. The Police cannot ask for a Remand Order from the Magistrates only for the purpose of taking a statement from you.</p>

<p>The police must satisfy the Magistrate that the remand is necessary. The police must show that:</p>

<p>(a)	Their investigation cannot be completed; and</p>

<p>(b)	There are reasons for believing that the accusation or information against you are well founded</p>

<p>The Magistrate has the jurisdiction to grant the Remand Order as the Magistrate thinks fit for a term not exceeding 14 days in the whole (inclusive of the day of arrest). The Magistrate authorising the detention would have to record his reasons for doing so. Within that period, you must be charged with an offence. Otherwise, you must be released.</p>

<p>In serious cases however, there are provisions where remand can be extended while the investigation is carried out. There are offences where bail is not applicable (for example, offences with mandatory death penalty) and therefore the remand period would be extended as required.</p>

<h4>What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>Depending on the offence, you would either be eligible to apply for bail whilst awaiting trial or you would be transferred to a remand prison, whilst you await your next court appearance. If you are remanded in prison, a Consular Representative will visit you to check on your welfare and to pass any messages you may have from your family or friends. You may want to engage with a lawyer, who can provide legal advice on your case.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<h4>Criminal offences and bail:</h4>

<p>For the purpose of bail, criminal offences can be categorised into 3 types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where bail is granted as of right, i.e. as a matter of course (offences eligible for bail)</li>
  <li>where bail is granted at the discretion of the court (offences not eligible for bail)</li>
  <li>where bail cannot be granted at all, for example, some dangerous drugs or firearms offences (offences not eligible for bail)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bailor and the bail bond:</h4>

<p>The court will impose a reasonable sum of money as security to ensure that you appear on the next date. The amount depends on the seriousness of the offence.</p>

<p>Before the court makes a decision, you (or your lawyer) and the prosecuting officer may put forward the arguments on the amount to be imposed.</p>

<p>In practice, after the bail is granted, your lawyer must alert you to have a bailor on standby. A bailor is a person who is willing to furnish the security for your release. You may ask a family member or a friend to be your bailor. Bailors can deposit some security in the form of fixed deposit receipts, savings passbooks or even land title deeds. The court may require 2 Malaysians, aged between 21 years and 60 years old, to pose as sureties.</p>

<h4>Bail for serious offences:</h4>

<p>For serious offences, the court may impose certain conditions for bail to prevent you from leaving Malaysia without permission, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Impounding (retaining) of your passport. 
*Requiring you to report to the nearest police station once a week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> 
### Trial and legal assistance</p>

<h4>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, a list of English-speaking lawyers is available. The list also states the availability of Pro bono (legal firm funded) and legal aid (government funded, not immediately available to foreign nationals) services for each local lawyer. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>At the remand proceedings, you have the right to appoint lawyer to represent you. The Magistrate must allow this unless the police can satisfy the Magistrate that it would interfere with police investigation.</p>

<h4>What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>Depending on your offence, the court may set dates for case management hearings where you and your lawyer, if one was appointed, are required to attend. Some courts in Malaysia conduct proceedings in Bahasa Malaysia (Malay Language) and some may conduct proceedings in English. You can request for interpreters.</p>

<p>Consular Representatives do not usually attend court, nor are we able to provide you with legal advice. We may consider attending court for certain cases, to support you or your family. This is on case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If you do not appear in court when you are instructed to, a warrant of arrest will be issued against you.</p>

<p>At the same time, the court may issue a “notice to show cause” to the bailor. The court will fix a hearing date for the bailor to come to court. If the court does not accept the bailor’s explanation, the security bond will be forfeited.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>If you are found guilty, the court may impose a fine or may sentence you to a period of imprisonment, or both. The amount of fine imposed or the length of your imprisonment sentence would depend on your offence. Some offences in Malaysia may also include the corporal punishment of strokes of whipping.<br>
It is at the discretion of courts whether or not to impose the maximum sentence for your offence.</p>

<p>Malaysia imposes the mandatory death penalty for serious offences including drug trafficking, murder, or firearm offences, if found guilty of these offences.</p>

<p>In most cases, upon serving your sentence, you will be handed by the prison to the immigration authorities who will then make a decision on whether to issue a deportation order or not.</p>

<p>The High Commission will not be able to make representations on a proposed deportation, however, you are advised to seek legal advice on the matter.</p>

<h4>How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>If you are found guilty of an offence, you can file an appeal with the courts. It is advisable to seek legal advice on this process and discuss with your lawyer on your options.</p>

<p>When you file an appeal, your case will first be heard at the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal will consider your case and the evidence that was presented during your trial.</p>

<p>If the Court of Appeal decides to uphold your conviction, you then have another opportunity to appeal through the Federal Court. A panel of five judges will sit and consider your case.</p>

<p>There are a number of possible outcomes of the appeals process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the courts may decide that you were wrongfully convicted and acquit you of your charge(s)</li>
  <li>the courts may to convict you of a lesser charge, and may reduce your sentence</li>
  <li>the courts may uphold the original decision and uphold your conviction</li>
</ul>

<p>If the decision is maintained at Federal Court, then the formal judicial process will be exhausted. The only other option open to you is to seek clemency from the highest state official. The power to grant clemency is given to the King (“Yang di-Pertuan Agong) for offences committed in the Federal Territories, Malacca, Penang, Sabah and Sarawak. For the remaining states in Malaysia, the power to grant clemency is given to the Ruler of the State (“Yang d-Pertua Negeri”) for offences committed in these states.</p>

<p>The members sitting in the Pardons Board are the Attorney-General, Chief Ministers of the State and not more than 3 members who are appointed by the King or the Ruler of the State. Under the Prison Regulations 2000, the Prison Director has a responsibility to support you in making a clemency application.</p>

<p>If you are acquitted of an offence, the prosecutor can also file an appeal with the courts. The Court of Appeal may remand an acquitted person who is a foreigner pending disposal of the Prosecution’s appeal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>With a view to encouraging good conduct, you are entitled to be granted remission as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are sentenced with a term of imprisonment exceeding one month, you may be granted as remission one-third of your sentence</li>
  <li>if you are sentenced with a term of imprisonment of one month or less, you will not be granted remission</li>
</ul>

<p>For your benefit under this provision it is important that your conduct, whilst in prison, is good.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>Parole can be considered, with a view of encouraging good conduct and to facilitate reformative treatment. The Parole Board, which consists of prison officers, prison welfare offices and the general public, will consider parole applications based on the prisoner’s eligibility and good behaviour. However, only some of the offences committed can be eligible for parole. Offences that would not qualify for parole include drug offences and firearm offences.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>You may seek clemency or pardon if you have exhausted all formal judicial process of appealing against your conviction. Application for clemency or pardon will be considered by the highest state official of the state where your conviction was handed down.</p>

<p>The power to grant clemency is given to the King (“Yang di-Pertuan Agong) for offences committed in the Federal Territories, Malacca, Penang, Sabah and Sarawak. For the remaining states in Malaysia, the power to grant clemency is given to the Ruler of the State (“Yang di-Pertua Negeri”) for offences committed in these states.</p>

<p>The members sitting in the Pardons Board are the Attorney-General, Chief Ministers of the State and not more than 3 members who are appointed by the King or by the Ruler of the State. Under the Prison Regulations 2000, the Prison Director has a responsibility to support you in making a clemency application.</p>

<p>If you are convicted of an offence which carries the death penalty, and if you have exhausted all formal judicial process of appealing against your conviction, you may be able to seek clemency against the death penalty. If successful, the state official or Pardon Board could consider commuting your death penalty to an imprisonment sentence instead. This is on case-by-case basis, and is at the discretion of the state official.</p>

<h4>What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>If you are found guilty, the court may impose a fine or may sentence you to a period of imprisonment, or both. The amount of fine imposed would depend on your offence. Fines must be paid to the court where your case was heard.</p>

<p>It is at the discretion of courts whether or not to impose the maximum fine for your offence.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to another prison within Malaysia possible?</h4>

<p>The Director General may remove or transfer prisoners confined in a prison to any other prison in Malaysia.</p>

<p>A prisoner under the death sentence which the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Ruler or Yang diPertua Negeri has ordered to be carried out may, by order of the Director General, be transferred to any other prison, to undergo his sentence.</p>

<p>You can make a request to transfer to another prison within Malaysia with the prison authorities; however this is on case-by-case basis and is at the discretion of the prisons.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>No. There is currently no Prisoner Transfer Agreement between the UK and Malaysia.</p>

<p>To find out more about transfers to the UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/in-prison-abroad/in-prison-abroad-transfer-to-a-uk-prison">In prison abroad: transfer to a UK prison</a></p>

<h4>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>Upon the completion of your custodial prison sentence, you may be transferred to the care of Malaysian Immigration Department. If you are moved into an immigration deportation camp, your exit papers will be processed and you will be deported from Malaysia.</p>

<p>Malaysian Immigration Department has explicitly specified that convicted offenders must be deported to the country of origin, which is the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Malaysian Immigration Department has also specified that the costs of your flight to the UK and any additional costs (for example, issuance of emergency travel document) must be borne by you or by your family.</p>

<p>In some cases, Malaysian Immigration Department may also impose a blacklist record upon you, which could prohibit you from re-entering Malaysia. The blacklist period could be up to 5 years.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<p>Other sources of practical help back in the UK are The Salvation Army – UK Helpline 020 7367 4888, Monday to Friday 8 AM to 4 PM, or contact your local Salvation Army branch – and The Prison Fellowship, UK Helpline 020 7799 2500, Monday to Friday 9 AM to 5 PM.</p>

<h4>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>
