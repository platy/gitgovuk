<p>HMRC has today announced an agreement reached with Jersey about the interpretation of paragraph 2(1)(f) of the 1952 Jersey-UK Double Taxation Agreements (<abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTA</abbr>) (company residence tie-breaker).</p>

<p>Following a review of other <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTAs</abbr> including identical or very similarly-worded provisions, HMRC now takes the view that the better interpretation of the equivalent provisions in these <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTAs</abbr> is that they include a tie-breaker clause to decide where a company is to be treated as resident for the purposes of the affected <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTAs</abbr>. This represents a change of view.</p>

<p>HMRC’s previous view was that a dual-resident company — for example, a company resident in the UK by virtue of incorporation and resident in the other jurisdiction by virtue of management and control — was not a resident of either jurisdiction under the terms of the provisions and so was outside the scope of the <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTA</abbr>. HMRC now takes the view that these provisions should be read as treating such a dual-resident company as a resident of the jurisdiction in which it is managed and controlled, for the purposes of applying the affected <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>In cases where the company is managed and controlled in both the UK and the other jurisdiction, it will remain outside the scope of the <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTA</abbr>. A schedule of the affected <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreements">DTAs</abbr> and provisions is set out:</p>
