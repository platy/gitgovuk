<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What is “Rule 6 status”?</h2>

<p>1.1 “Rule 6 status” refers to Rule 6(6) of the Inquiries Procedure Rules relevant to the particular inquiry. These are The Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000 and The Town and Country Planning Appeals (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000.</p>

<p>1.2  Rule 6(6) states that:</p>

<p>“The Secretary of State may in writing require any other person, who has notified him of an intention or wish to appear at an inquiry, to send within 4 weeks of being so required –</p>

<p>(a) 3 copies of their statement of case to him; and</p>

<p>(b) a copy of their statement to any statutory party,</p>

<p>and the Secretary of State shall, as soon as practicable after receipt, send a copy of each such statement of case to the local planning authority and to the applicant/appellant.”</p>

<p>1.3 From this extract from the Rules you will see that Rule 6 parties have the responsibility to send us a statement of case. They also have rights which are explained in this guide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How do I apply for “Rule 6 status”?</h2>

<p>2.1 If you wish to take a very active part in an inquiry you should contact us immediately requesting “Rule 6” status. However, to avoid making the inquiry too repetitious, we encourage participants with similar views to group together and elect a spokesperson to appear at the inquiry on the group’s behalf. You should state who you are representing (for example, a parish council or local community group), why you want “Rule 6 status” and briefly explain what you can bring to the inquiry that another party may not. It is unusual for “Rule 6 status” to be granted to individuals.</p>

<p>2.2 Rule 6 parties can offer significant value to the inquiry process. However this is only the case where Rule 6 parties add substantively to the case being made by the local planning authority or the appellant (for an appeal) or the applicant (for an application which has been “called-in”).</p>

<p>2.3 For further information please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/called-in-planning-applications-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>. This document is subsequently referred to throughout this guide, other than for information on a called-in planning application. For further information about a called-in planning application please see Annexe A of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/called-in-planning-applications-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals and called-in planning applications – England”</a>.</p>

<p>2.4 Depending on whether you oppose or support the appeal or the application you may wish to consult the local planning authority or the appellant or applicant to find out what their position will be at the inquiry to help you decide whether your position can be satisfactorily represented by them. If this is the case, you would not need to ask us for Rule 6 status.</p>

<p>2.5 With “Rule 6 status” you will be considered to be a main party. You will be sent copies of the documents sent to us by the other main parties (eg. the applicant/appellant, the local planning authority and any other Rule 6 parties). You will be entitled to appear at the inquiry and to cross-examine other parties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>The inquiry procedure</h2>

<p>3.1 At:</p>

<p>Annexe A there is a timetable for planning appeals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appeals where the local planning authority has taken enforcement action so the 28 days appeal period applies see paragraph 2.4.3 of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide – Planning appeals - England”</a> (except householder appeals);</li>
  <li>for householder and minor commercial development appeals which we determine are not suitable for the Part 1 written representations process and that an inquiry is necessary; and</li>
  <li>which are recovered for the Secretary of State to make the decision (rather than one of our Inspectors).</li>
</ul>

<p>Annexe B there is a timetable for planning appeals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not a ‘recovered’ appeal;</li>
  <li>the time limit of 28 days does not apply where the local planning authority has taken enforcement action (as explained in paragraph 2.4.3 of our  <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide – Planning appeals - England”</a>;
it is not an appeal where we have determined that the appeal is not suitable for written representations under the Part 1 process and that an inquiry is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2 For further information please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals</a>.</p>

<p>3.3 It is very important for all parties to keep to the timetable for the receipt of documents, whatever timetable the appeal is following.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Statement of case</h2>

<p>4.1 We will instruct Rule 6 parties to send us a statement of case, usually within 4 weeks of the date of our letter which grants “Rule 6 status being confirmed by the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

<p>4.2 For appeals where the dates in paragraph 3.3 apply and for called-in applications – in your statement of case you will need to give full details of the case you will put forward at the inquiry. You must list any documents, including maps and plans, to which you intend to refer or use in evidence. Although you only have to list documents at this stage, it would be helpful if you supplied copies with your statement of case.</p>

<p>4.3 For appeals where the dates in paragraph 3.1 – Annexe A apply you need to provide a <strong>full</strong> statement of case. A “full statement of case means, and is comprised of, a written statement which contains full particulars of the case which a person proposes to put forward and <strong>copies of any documents</strong> which that person intends to refer to or put in evidence”. For further information please see Annexe
J of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>4.4 You must send us one copy of your statement of case/full statement of case for the Inspector and one each for the appellant or applicant, the local planning authority and any other Rule 6 parties. On larger inquiries where 2 Inspectors are appointed, or where an additional copy of documents is required for the Secretary of State, we will ask you to provide 2 copies for the Inspector(s).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Statement of common ground</h2>

<p>5.1 The appellant/applicant and the local planning authority must jointly prepare a statement of common ground. This should list all agreed matters and should include basic facts such as the site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, and as many other matters as possible relating to the application.</p>

<p>5.2 Please see Annexe R of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a> to see when the agreed statement of common ground must be received by us.</p>

<p>5.3 With the agreement of the appellant/applicant and the local planning authority, Rule 6 parties can also agree a statement of common 
ground. This will establish those matters which are agreed with the main parties, which means that the inquiry can then focus on the issues which are in dispute (uncommon ground). If you wish to do this you should contact the appellant/applicant and the local planning authority at the earliest opportunity - even if this is before you have asked us for “Rule 6 status”. The local planning authority will be able to tell you the deadline for the agreed statement of common ground.</p>

<p>5.4 If there is more than one Rule 6 party it can also be helpful if they can jointly produce a statement of common ground.</p>

<p>5.5 For further information please see Annexe R of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Proofs of evidence</h2>

<p>6.1 If you propose to give, or to call another person to give, evidence at the inquiry by reading a proof of evidence you must send:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 copies of it and any written summary to us; and</li>
  <li>one copy of it and any written summary to any statutory party;</li>
</ul>

<p>no later than 4 weeks before the date fixed for the holding of the inquiry.</p>

<p>6.2 A ‘proof of evidence’ is the document containing the written evidence about which a person appearing at a public inquiry will speak. Proofs of evidence should be concise and ideally contain facts and expert opinion deriving from witnesses’ own professional or local knowledge as applied to individual cases.</p>

<p>6.3 Accordingly, the main role of a ‘proof of evidence’ is to allow witnesses to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marshal previously provided evidence in a way which is convenient to the presentation of their case at the inquiry;</li>
  <li>give their professional opinion or opinion based on local knowledge on evidence provided by other parties in their statements of case.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.4 Your proof of evidence should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>refer to the information that your witnesses wish the Inspector to take into account;</li>
  <li>cover only areas where you disagree with another party;</li>
  <li>contain the witness’s concisely expressed opinion and argument;</li>
  <li>contain a clear cross reference to any supporting documents, for example containing data, analysis or copies of legal cases which should have been be provided with your statement of case;</li>
  <li>not include new areas of evidence unless, exceptionally, there is good reason why new factual evidence has to await the exchange of written proof(s);</li>
  <li>not repeat or quote national or local policy, but should 
provide policy name and paragraph numbers;</li>
  <li>not omit necessary detail;</li>
  <li>not include long irrelevant biographical detail of the witness.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.5 The evidence of each of your witness(es) should address distinct topics and not overlap another’s.</p>

<p>6.6 Witnesses and their advocates should limit the length of proofs. If the proof exceeds 1,500 words it should be accompanied by a
summary. It is normally only the summaries that will be read out at the inquiry.</p>

<p>6.7 Summaries should concentrate on the main points at issue. They must not introduce new or different evidence nor go beyond the scope of the text they summarise. It may sometimes be difficult to summarise complex technical evidence effectively, and the above advice is not intended to prevent witnesses properly explaining their evidence. Successful summaries of complex evidence will help make the salient points clearer to the interested parties, as well as saving time.</p>

<p>6.8 If the proof of evidence includes evidence given by an expert witness please see Annexe O of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>7.1 These are documents that are of general/background relevance to the inquiry. With the agreement of the other parties, a document that will be referred to by more than one party can be added to the core documents list. Either the local planning authority or appellant/applicant may coordinate the core documents list. If you wish to suggest inclusion of a core document you should provide copies of that document to the appellant/applicant, the local planning authority and to any other statutory party.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Sending documents to us electronically</h2>

<p>8.1 Whilst we encourage electronic working, we strongly encourage parties additionally to provide hard copies of certain documents such as statements of case, proofs of evidence and appendices to ensure the smooth running of the inquiry. If any document is sent electronically we may ask you to provide hard copies if the document is particularly lengthy. Any printed copies must be of the final versions provided to us.
Do not use hyperlinks within documents you send. If you wish to refer to a document then, if it is not a core document, it needs to be provided with your statement of case.</p>

<p>8.2 Please see Annexe I “Communicating electronically with us” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a> for additional guidance about sending us documents through the Planning Portal or by email.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Case Management conference</h2>

<p>9.1 This will take place with the appellant, LPA, any Rule 6 party and anyone else invited by the Inspector.</p>

<p>9.2 A pre-conference note will be sent out in advance. Amongst other things this will set out what the Inspector considers the main issues are likely to be and any other matters that may need to be addressed. Also the note will set out how the Inspector thinks that the evidence can best be addressed in order to conduct the inquiry in the most efficient and effective manner.</p>

<p>9.3 The parties are requested to consider these matters, which will be discussed at the conference. The note will also be accompanied by an agenda and a reminder of case conference call etiquette.</p>

<p>9.4 The matters to be discussed will be decided by the Inspector but will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a preliminary identification of the main issues;</li>
  <li>consideration of whether the evidence would be most efficiently
dealt with through a topic- by- topic approach</li>
  <li>identification of parts of the evidence that could be dealt with in a round table discussion or written representations rather than formal cross-examination;</li>
  <li>agreement on further matters through position statements, topic
papers or updated statements of common ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>9.5 A note of the proceedings, which will include the Inspector’s decision on how the evidence is to be dealt with, will be produced within 5 working days of the case conference.</p>

<p>9.6 For some appeals the Inspector may decide to issue a Case Management Note rather than hold a Conference. In the largest cases the Inspector may decide to hold a Pre-Inquiry Meeting.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Pre-inquiry meetings</h2>

<p>10.1 When a planning inquiry is likely to last 8 or more days a pre- inquiry meeting is usually held, although one may be held before a shorter inquiry. A pre-inquiry meeting is a public meeting but it is principally for the benefit of the Inspector and main parties. We will invite Rule 6 parties to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>10.2 The purpose of the meeting is to prepare for the actual inquiry by discussing procedural and other arrangements. No evidence about the case will be heard at the meeting. The meeting should help to ensure that the inquiry runs efficiently and will help everyone to concentrate on the main issues in dispute, saving time and expense for all.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Openness and transparency</h2>

<p>11.1 Inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>11.2 If you want to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, you should contact us and the local planning authority in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Inquiry arrangements</h2>

<p>12.1 We ask the local planning authority to arrange the inquiry venue. Inquiries are usually held in local planning authority offices, village halls or community centres. For further information please see the Planning Inspectorate: <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/setting-up-a-venue-for-a-public-inquiry-hearing-or-examination">“The venue and facilities for public inquiries and hearings”</a>.</p>

<p>12.2 We will notify the appellant/applicant, the local planning authority and every person entitled to appear at the inquiry of the date, time, place and expected length of the inquiry and the name of the Inspector.</p>

<p>12.3 We want to hold all inquiries in buildings with proper facilities for people with disabilities. If you, or anyone you know, want to go to the inquiry and you have particular needs, please contact the local planning authority to confirm that they can make proper arrangements.</p>

<p>12.4 Inquiries usually open on a Tuesday at 10:00. Unless there has been a pre-inquiry meeting (see section 9 above) the Inspector will agree the sitting times with the main parties at the start of the inquiry. It is often agreed that the inquiry will start at 9:30 on subsequent days. Inquiries usually sit until about 17:00 or 17.30 each day but may finish earlier on a Friday. There will usually be a mid-morning and mid- afternoon break and a 1 hour break for lunch. The Inspector should not be approached during breaks as other participants in the inquiry would not know what was being said. Inquiries do not usually sit on a Monday.</p>

<p>12.5 At the discretion of the Inspector, and dependent on a suitable inquiry venue being available, an evening inquiry session is occasionally held if there are a significant number of interested parties who cannot attend during the daytime inquiry sessions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Advocates</h2>

<p>13.1 There is no requirement for anyone to be legally represented by a solicitor or barrister. However it is customary for each of the main parties at an inquiry to have an advocate representing them. Advocates do not need to have legal qualifications. Their role is to present their party’s opening statement, go through each of their witness’s evidence in chief, cross-examine the opposing parties’ witnesses, and present their party’s closing statement. When advocates are inexperienced the Inspector will assist and advise, where necessary, of the procedures to be followed.</p>

<p>13.2 If a Rule 6 party does not have an advocate then one of their witnesses can act as advocate. This is especially important if you wish to cross-examine any of the other main parties. If you do not nominate somebody to be your advocate then you will need to introduce yourself to the inquiry and present your proof of evidence without anyone taking you through it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>What happens at the inquiry?</h2>

<p>14.1 An inquiry is the most formal of the appeal procedures, and it usually involves larger or more complicated appeals. An inquiry may last for several days, or even weeks. It is not a court of law, but the proceedings will often seem to be quite similar. Often expert evidence is presented and witnesses are cross-examined (questioned).</p>

<p>14.2 The Inspector will normally have seen the site location and the surrounding area before the inquiry event but will normally make a further accompanied visit during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>14.3 When the Inspector opens the inquiry on the first day he/she will firstly deal with any ‘housekeeping’ matters (such as what the inquiry is about, where the fire exits are etc). The Inspector will then usually give an outline of what will happen at the inquiry. The Inspector will ask whether there are any interested parties who wish to speak at the inquiry, this is often called “taking the appearances”.</p>

<p>14.4 The order of appearances is at the discretion of the Inspector who will usually take into account the views of the parties and the particular circumstances of the case. The Inspector will make it clear at the start of the inquiry what the order of appearances will be.</p>

<p>14.5 Each of the main parties will make their opening statements, which set out what their case will be. For a planning inquiry the order of these is usually the appellant/applicant, the local planning authority and then any Rule 6 parties. When the witnesses give their evidence it is 
usual for the local planning authority to go first, followed by any Rule 6 parties that oppose the appeal/application, then any Rule 6 parties that support the appeal/application and finally the appellant/applicant. The order may be different for call-in inquiries.</p>

<p>14.6 The Inspector will usually ask if you are willing to answer questions about your evidence. You do not have to do this, though it is often helpful to do so and it may add weight to your evidence. Do not feel intimidated. The Inspector will not let anyone ask you hostile or unfair questions.</p>

<p>14.7 Each witness will be taken through their evidence by reading their summary proof of evidence and/or parts of their main proof. Leading questions, ie. a question in which the answer is suggested by the question, are not allowed (for example “Would you agree that…”). The witness then may be subject to cross-examination by opposing parties.</p>

<p>14.8 If you object to the proposal, the appellant’s representative may ask you questions. If you support it, the local planning authority’s representative may ask you questions. In turn, Rule 6 parties should ensure that their cross-examination of other parties is succinct, fair and relevant to the planning matters at issue.</p>

<p>14.9 After cross-examination, parties can do what is called “re- examination”. If a witness has made a mistake or got in a muddle during their cross-examination, their advocate can try to correct things by discussing the subject again and asking further questions of their witness to ensure that their case is clarified. It is not the function of re- examination to invite the witness to revisit clear answers given in cross- examination.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>At the end of the inquiry</h2>

<p>15.1 After the evidence has been heard the parties may make closing statements which are an opportunity to sum up their case. They are usually read out loud from a pre-prepared written version and this can be added to, by hand if necessary, before being given to the Inspector and other main parties.</p>

<p>15.2 After the closing statements the Inspector will normally close the inquiry.  This is followed by the Inspector making arrangements to visit the appeal site.</p>

<p>15.3 If the inquiry was closed before the site visit no further detailed discussion on the merits of the case will be permitted during the formal site visit. This is because it could lead to further oral evidence being given by one party or interested person and could compromise the fairness, openness and impartiality of the process.  The Inspector will necessarily be courteous but firm about not allowing any inappropriate discussions or comments to be made at the site visit.</p>

<p>15.4 However, where the parties have referred in their evidence to certain physical characteristics of a site, building or area, the Inspector will allow those to be pointed out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Costs</h2>

<p>16.1 There is no cost to being a Rule 6 party other than what you may incur in preparing your evidence (eg photocopying, binding and posting) and attending the inquiry.</p>

<p>16.2 All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>16.3 There is guidance about costs awards in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/collections/planning-practice-guidance">Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a></p>

<p>16.4 It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>16.5 Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<p>16.6 The Inspector will remind parties that any application for costs should be made before the end of the inquiry.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>The decision</h2>

<p>17.1 If it is an inquiry into a called-in application or a “recovered” appeal to be decided by the Secretary of State, the Inspector will write a report with recommendations to the Secretary of State. Our Case Officer will normally write to the parties, within 10 working days of the close of the inquiry, to let them know the date by which the Secretary of State’s decision will be issued.</p>

<p>17.2 For other appeals the decision will be made by the Inspector.</p>

<p>17.3 When made, the decision (either by the Inspector or the Secretary of State) will be published on GOV.UK and can be viewed using <a class="govuk-link" href="/appeal-planning-inspectorate">the search facility</a>.</p>
