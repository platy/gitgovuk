<p>We are collecting evidence on the research and innovation (<abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr>) workforce to create a better evidence base for policy decision-making in <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and other relevant government departments.</p>

<p>This notice sets out how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and/or 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Your data</h2>

<p>The Research and Innovation (<abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr>) Workforce Survey will include optional questions about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>health conditions</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>first half of home postcode</li>
  <li>first half of work postcode</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants who agree to be recontacted (for an in-depth interview or for a future wave of the survey) will be asked to provide their name, job title, email address and phone number.</p>

<p>Participants who agree to have their data linked with other datasets will be asked to provide their date of birth.</p>

<p>Participation in the survey is voluntary and questions relating to personal data can be left unanswered.</p>

<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) (data controller) commissioned Market &amp; Opinion Research International Limited (data processor), a specialist research agency, commonly known as Ipsos, to collect and analyse data for this survey on <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ behalf: see the <a class="govuk-link" href="">Ipsos privacy notice</a>.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Boosting innovation is one of the government’s priorities and forms one of the pillars for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/build-back-better-our-plan-for-growth">Build back better: plan for growth</a>. Innovation is a key driver of economic growth and improvements to living standards, through the development of new ideas, products and processes and their adoption and diffusion across the economy. The UK government is increasing its investment in research and development (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>) and will use it to boost <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> strengths across the UK as one of the key tools to increase innovation, backing the priorities set out in the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-research-and-development-roadmap">Research and Development Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>This project will be the first survey taking in all sectors of the wider <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce run by the UK government. At present, decision makers are reliant on a patchwork of surveys and data sources for different <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> sectors. This survey hopes to fill crucial data gaps on the wider <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce, including information on protected characteristics which is critical to supporting equality, diversity and inclusion in the <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce.</p>

<h2>Data linking</h2>

<p>You will be asked if you agree to match your personal data to:</p>

<p>a) one or more existing government datasets: Higher Education Statistical Authority data, Longitudinal Educations Outcomes data, UK Innovation Survey or <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> Expenditure data. This will give <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> a better overall picture of the <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce, their education and career paths</p>

<p>b) UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) grants datasets. This will provide UKRI with evidence on how to better tailor the policy and grants support that they offer to the <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce</p>

<p>All information collected as part of this project will be used for research purposes and forming an evidence base for better policy decision-making.</p>

<h2>Legal basis of processing</h2>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>public task</strong>: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller, such as the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of this project, the public task relates to collecting evidence on the <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce to create a better evidence base for policy decision-making in <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and other relevant government departments that is covered by paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (statutory and government purposes).
All information would be used for research and statistical purposes only and all data analysis will be about groups of people rather than individuals.</p>

<p>The legal basis for processing Special Category Personal Data (also known as Sensitive Personal Data) is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest for the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice; and an appropriate policy document is in place. For the purposes of this project, the public task relates to collecting evidence on the <abbr title="research and innovation">R&amp;I</abbr> workforce including its diversity to create a better evidence base for policy decision-making in <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and other relevant government departments that is covered by paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (statutory and government purposes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>Special Category Personal Data is personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
