<h2>Cross-departmental</h2>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>The department believes that the statistics provided by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> must be accessible to the widest possible audience. This is not only in making statistical releases straightforward to understand, but also by ensuring the documents that we publish are accessible to those with disabilities, and work with computer software. HTML releases are designed to meet accessibility standards as they can reach many users, including those with disabilities.  This is also in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made" rel="external">Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</a>. These regulations state that an organisation must make their website or mobile app more accessible by making it ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’.</p>

<p>We have published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics/accessibility-statement-for-dwp-statistics">Accessibility Statement for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Statistics</a> that provides full information on the strategy <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has adopted.</p>

<p>The strategy is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publishing statistical releases as fully accessible HTML documents</li>
  <li>publishing static tables in open source Open Document Spreadsheet format</li>
  <li>using Stat-Xplore for accessible underlying data and interactive graphs and tables</li>
  <li>ensuring that the information from interactive charts and tools are made available in an accessible format, by publishing the underlying data in accessible spreadsheets</li>
</ul>

<p>All publications released by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> after 23 September 2020 are fully compliant and all new iterations of statistical bulletins released from 23 September 2020 onward are fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made" rel="external">Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary statistics</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Benefits Statistical Summary (Quarterly)</h3>

<p>This is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-statistical-summaries">compendium publication</a> that brings together key statistics on benefits administered by the department to provide a complete picture of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> responsibility. Statistics on Housing Benefit (administered by Local Authorities) and Universal Credit are also included.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changed the working age methodology and statistics to reflect the rising State Pension age</li>
  <li>introduced more formal user engagement by forming working groups with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expert analysts for both pension age and Housing Benefit to ensure published data reflects policy and user need</li>
  <li>improved Quality Assurance consistent with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government">The Aqua Book</a> guidance on producing quality analysis and increased documentation of risks and assumptions</li>
  <li>in 2020, the statistics underwent assessment by the Office for Statistics regulation, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/assessment-report-benefit-statistics/" rel="external">published report</a> recommended that the statistics continue to be designated as National Statistics</li>
  <li>published Housing Benefit Flows data on Stat-Xplore for the first time in November 2020</li>
  <li>published Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit data on Stat-Xplore for the first time in June 2021</li>
  <li>provided data on claim times, decision times and reassessments for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit in August and November 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefit Combinations</h3>

<p>The aim of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/dwp-benefits-statistics-may-2022">Benefit Combinations statistics</a> is to provide both Working Age and Pension Age statistics on the number of individuals claiming a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit in total ( only counting each individual claimant once) – and to show the key combinations of benefits claimed. The statistics have been developed using guidelines set out by the UK Statistics Authority, and as official statistics undergoing evaluation they have accordingly been badged as Experimental Statistics.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in February 2021, the publication was extended to include Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit and a marker showing the number of benefits claimed to existing series (February 2013 onwards), alongside a number of methodological changes to improve data quality and efficiency. The addition allows the series to better meet original user requirement of being able to state how many people are on benefits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>from February 2022, Bereavement Support Payment (<abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr>) was added to the Benefit Combinations statistics for the first time. It has been included in every quarter’s data since <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> was first introduced in April 2017. The addition of <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> allows the series to better meet the original user requirement of being able to state how many people are on benefits.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Children, Families and Bereavement</h2>

<h3>Child Maintenance Service Statistics</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-on-the-2012-statutory-child-maintenance-scheme">Child Maintenance Service statistics</a> report on the quarterly performance of the Child Maintenance Service. Child maintenance is financial support between separated parents to help with the everyday living costs of looking after children.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in response to user demand, via Parliamentary Questions (<abbr title="Parliamentary Questions">PQs</abbr>) and Freedom of Information (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) requests, more detailed information around sanctions options available to Child Maintenance Service, such as the confiscation of passports and driving licences and imprisonment, have been included in the publication</li>
  <li>completed a methodology review to improve how cases are assigned to Direct Pay and Collect and Pay</li>
  <li>in December 2020, an external user group was created. This routine interaction with external stakeholders helps ensure the data is as useful as possible both internally and publicly</li>
  <li>information on arrangements and children was published on Stat-Xplore during 2020. This will be maintained with the release of each new quarter and tables will be developed relating to parents for future iterations of Stat-Xplore releases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Children in low income families</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/children-in-low-income-families-local-area-statistics">Children in low income families (<abbr title="Children in low income families">CiLIF</abbr>) publication</a> was first released in March 2020 and was produced jointly by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.  The publication provides information about the number and proportion of children living in low income families by local area. Previously, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> published Official Statistics on children in low income families, however these statistics did not include families on Universal Credit and thus were no longer fit-for-purpose. The new Children in Low Income Families publication is more comprehensive and analyses family income across all <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits including Universal Credit, Tax Credits, as well as earning from employment and self-employment.</p>

<p>The statistics in this release complement and should be viewed as a companion to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">Households Below Average Income (<abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>)</a> release which provides survey estimates of children in low income households at national and regional level.</p>

<p>There has been a steady stream of interest subsequently in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/north-east-child-poverty-figures-18148779" rel="external">local news reporting</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn07096/" rel="external">House of Commons Research Reports</a>.</p>

<p>User requirement for publication:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local area measures enable Local Authorities to target resources at smaller areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the experimental statistics label was removed in March 2021 after assessment by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Head of Profession for Statistics. This means that the statistics meet the high standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value and comply with the Code of Practice and reflect factors including user feedback, methodological robustness, coverage, and that the defined development phase for these statistics has ended</li>
  <li>to align with Household Below Average Income (<abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>) statistics the coverage of the statistics was extended to Northern Ireland in the March 2021 publication and the statistics were published solely by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The <abbr title="Children in low income families">CiLIF</abbr> publication complements <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> stats and is intended to be viewed as a companion to the <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> release</li>
</ul>

<h2>Employment Support Schemes</h2>

<h3>Access to Work recipients</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/access-to-work-statistics">Access to Work</a> is a programme that aims to help people who have a disability or long-term health condition start or stay in work. The associated publication is released annually in August or September.</p>

<p>There are 2 main types of Access to Work provision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Assessments’</li>
  <li>‘Elements’</li>
</ul>

<p>Assessments involve exploring workplace-related barriers to employment while Elements are intended to supplement the reasonable adjustments that employers are required to make under the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terminology has been improved throughout the publication to remove ambiguity for example to provide clarification on the distinction between “new starts” and “new customers”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health, Disability and Care</h2>

<h3>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>): outcomes of Work Capability Assessments (<abbr title="work capability assessment">WCA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/employment-and-support-allowance-outcomes-of-work-capability-assessment"><abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> publication</a> presents information on both new claims and claims undergoing reassessment of incapacity benefits for Employment and Support Allowance in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in 2020 a review of Mandatory Reconsideration narrative and matching methodology was undertaken to reflect the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connor-SSWP-CO-2253-2019-Final-judgment-24Jul20.pdf" rel="external">High Court judicial review</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal Independence Payment</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/personal-independence-payment-statistics">Personal Independent Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</a> was introduced from April 2013 for new claimants and from October 2013 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> began inviting claimants in receipt of Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) who were aged between 16 and 64 years on 8 April 2013, or reached age 16 after that date, to claim <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in June 2020, the frequency of the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> award review and change of circumstance registration and clearance statistics was updated on a quarterly basis rather than annually; clearance and cases with entitlement (caseload) datasets will have a new measure added so that users can tabulate average amounts of money received as a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> award (mean financial award) and a breakdown was added to all Stat-Xplore datasets to show whether a customer is of State Pension Age or not. The new information was particularly important when explaining initial COVID-19 impact on processing volumes for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>in December 2020, <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> reassessments to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> outcomes of existing child <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claimants was published. This meets internal stakeholder demand and will also contribute to reducing the number of <abbr title="Parliamentary Questions">PQs</abbr> and <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOIs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>addition of “Coronavirus COVID-19” disability classification into disability breakdowns to reflect the addition of the code operationally from March 2021</li>
  <li>showing disability as recorded at caseload date instead of at on-flow date as in the current methodology</li>
  <li>in December 2021, released Award Review and Change of Circumstance information in Stat-Xplore rather than ODS or Excel tables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Income and Living Standards</h2>

<h3>Cold Weather Payments</h3>

<p>The Social Fund Cold Weather Payments scheme runs from 1 November 2021 to 31 March 2022. This is known as the Cold Weather Payment season. The statistics are based on the estimated number of benefit units linked to each weather station that is eligible for Cold Weather Payments. A benefit unit is an adult and their partner (if applicable) and any dependent children living with them.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the weekly and monthly estimated payments for 2021 to 2022 include new breakdowns for England, Scotland and Wales, in addition to the estimates for Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family Resources Survey</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/family-resources-survey--2">Family Resources Survey (<abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>)</a> is a continuous household survey which collects information on a representative sample of private households in the United Kingdom. Detailed information is recorded on each respondent: their incomes, from all sources including self-employment, housing tenure, caring needs and responsibilities, disability, expenditure on housing, education, pension participation, childcare, family circumstances and child maintenance.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> is to provide the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) with data to inform the development, monitoring and evaluation of social welfare policy.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a publication consultation was held in Autumn 2020 to capture views of users of the publication</li>
  <li>the March 2021 publication included a section on Household Food Security for the first time. The breakdown includes the % of households with low or very low household food security and:
    <ul>
      <li>(i) whether or not they receive state benefits</li>
      <li>(ii) educational attainment</li>
      <li>(iii) overall level of income</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional tables were also included in the <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> publication to examine the relationship between poverty and household food security.</p>

<h3>Impact of COVID-19</h3>

<p>Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2020-to-2021/family-resources-survey-background-information-and-methodology#points-to-note"><abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> Background and methodology note</a> for further information on the impact of COVID-19 on the publication.</p>

<p>Details on the normal interview process can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020/family-resources-survey-background-information-and-methodology">latest methodology note</a></p>

<p>Households Below Average Income, Pensioners’ Incomes Series and Income-related benefits: estimates of take-up publications all use the Family Resources Survey data so will be affected by the changes to <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> data collection.</p>

<p>The Income Dynamics (<abbr title="Income Dynamics">ID</abbr>) publication is based on Understanding Society (<abbr title="Understanding Society">USOC</abbr>) data from the Institute for Social and Economic Research (<abbr title="Institute for Social and Economic Research">ISER</abbr>) at the University of Essex. <abbr title="Understanding Society">USOC</abbr> fieldwork has also been affected by COVID-19 but as a longitudinal survey the effect will be different to that on the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>. Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/income-dynamics-2010-to-2020/income-dynamics-background-information-and-methodology"><abbr title="Income Dynamics">ID</abbr> background and methodology note</a> for more information</p>

<h3>Households below average income (<abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2"><abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> statistics</a> report information on living standards in the UK based on household income measures. The report incorporates estimates of average incomes, income inequality, and the prevalence of low income households. <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> uses data from Family Resources Survey (<abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>methodological improvement was made to capture all income from Child Maintenance in <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>. This has resulted in more income from child maintenance being included, which in turn slightly increased some household incomes and reduced low income rates for families with children. The full back series of <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> statistics (back to financial year ending 1995) was revised so that comparisons over time are on a consistent basis for the full <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> time series of financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr>) 1995 to <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2020</li>
  <li>the statistics for the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2020 included a new section and tables on household food security (unaffordability) based on the information collected for the first time in the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2020</li>
  <li>extension of combined low income and material deprivation measures for children included in the March 2022 publication</li>
</ul>

<h3>Income dynamics</h3>

<p>This annual publication provides estimates of persistent low income as well as peoples’ movements within the income distribution. The Income Dynamics (<abbr title="Income Dynamics">ID</abbr>) publication uses data from Understanding Society, a longitudinal survey run by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (<abbr title="Institute for Social and Economic Research">ISER</abbr>) at the University of Essex.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved data visualisation in the publication and included new charts and diagrams (Sankey) to illustrate income movements between periods</li>
  <li>events associated with movements into and out of low income was added to the March 2021 publication</li>
  <li>in 2020, following the completion of development work, the experimental statistics label was removed and <abbr title="Income Dynamics">ID</abbr> was published as Official Statistics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pensions and Older People</h2>

<h3>Pensioners’ Incomes Series Statistics</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pensioners-incomes-series-statistics--3">Pensioners’ Incomes Series publication</a> reports on how much incomes pensioners get per week and the sources of these incomes. It is reported how incomes have changed over time, and how types of pensioner (single female, couples etc.) differ in incomes and sources.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regional and ethnicity data were published on Stat-Xplore allowing for more Pensioners’ Incomes custom tables for creation by all users</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spending, Fraud and Error</h2>

<h3>Benefit Cap Statistics</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/benefit-cap-statistics">benefit cap</a> is a limit on the total amount of benefit a household can get. It can be applied through reducing the amount of Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) or Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) received, so the total benefits no longer add up to more than the cap level.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in 2020, methodological changes were made to replace the data source from the Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>) to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Full Service (<abbr title="UC Full Service">UCFS</abbr>) data to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> caseload data.  This ensures better quality and orderly release of the statistics providing greater consistency with <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> official Statistics and publication of capped households after caseload data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in February 2021, a new time series was released for flows between Housing Benefit and Universal Credit based on new methodology, which will allow for overall off-flow time series</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fraud and error in the benefit system</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> pays benefits to over 20 million people. It is necessary to estimate how much money the department incorrectly pays, either through over or under payment. The overpayments or underpayments can occur for a number of reasons such as: Claimant error, Official error, or as a consequence of fraud. This annual publication presents estimates of the rates of these over and underpayments as well as their respective causes (fraud and error). Benefits measured as part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system">fraud and error analysis</a> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>Personal Independence Payment</li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact of COVID-19</h3>

<p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the benefit reviews that would normally feed into the 2021 Fraud and Error publication were stopped in mid-March 2020. This was due to a number of key factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>face-to-face reviews being unable to be carried out under social distancing restrictions</li>
  <li>claimants being unable to leave the house to post evidence in the early stages of the pandemic</li>
  <li>it being inappropriate to suspend benefits, which is a key tool in supporting compliance with the reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) reviews, which are carried out by telephone, restarted in mid-July 2020, alongside Official Error checks on State Pension (<abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>). On 13 May 2021 we published our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2020-to-2021-estimates">fraud and error in the benefit system financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr>) 2021 statistics</a>, which was based on the reviews carried out on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>. As we were unable to review other benefits we carried forward rates from previous years for all the benefits not reviewed this year to enable us to produce an overall (‘global’) estimate of fraud and error. Rolling forward rates is part of our normal methodology but, due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, we carried out additional analysis to ensure that it was a valid approach to take this year. We published a summary of this analysis in Appendix 3 of our publication, and more detail in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2020-to-2021-estimates/background-information-fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-statistics--2">background information and methodology note</a>.</p>

<p>In late 2020 and early 2021 we restarted full reviews on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Pension Credit (<abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>As yet we have not restarted reviews on Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>). We are also carrying out reviews on Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>) for the first time ever, and are carrying out a full review, including claimant error and fraud, on <abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr> for the first time since <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2006. The outcomes of these reviews will be reported in our <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2022 statistics in May 2022.</p>

<p>All benefit reviews for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2022 are being carried out by telephone rather than by a home visit. This is a change for all benefits except Universal Credit. This change has been instigated by the coronavirus pandemic, with telephone being the only practical way to restart our reviews. When publishing our <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2022 statistics we will need to consider whether this has impacted on our review outcomes and therefore the comparability of the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2022 statistics with previous years.</p>

<h3>Attendance Allowance</h3>

<p>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>) has been measured for the first time following user feedback from a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-the-fraud-and-error-statistics/outcome/response-to-proposals-for-changes-to-fraud-and-error-statistics">consultation in 2018</a> that identified <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> as a future benefit to measure. To date a proxy has been used to measure <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> for the rate of Fraud and Error. Measurement of <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> will enable understanding of errors within <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> due to its impact on entitlement to other benefits. Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2021-to-2022-estimates/background-information-fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-statistics-2021-to-2022-estimates#introduction-to-our-measurement-system">Background Information page</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>State Pension</h3>

<p>The National Audit Office (<abbr title="National Audit Office">NAO</abbr>) had a clear requirement for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to carry out full measurement of State Pension claimant error and fraud. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2021-to-2022-estimates/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-ending-fye-2022">May 2022 publication</a> provides the first full measurement of State Pension since 2005 to 2006. Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2021-to-2022-estimates/background-information-fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-statistics-2021-to-2022-estimates#introduction-to-our-measurement-system">Background Information page</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Work and Unemployment</h2>

<h3>National Insurance number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr>) allocations to adult overseas nationals</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-insurance-number-allocations-to-adult-overseas-nationals-entering-the-uk"><abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr> statistics</a> are published quarterly and show a count, by individual nationality, of the number of new (flow) of National Insurance numbers (<abbr title="National Insurance Numbers">NINos</abbr>) registered to adult non-UK nationals each quarter, irrespective of the length of stay in the UK. The statistics are not a count of the number of adult non-UK nationals currently residing in the UK. At November 2020 these were re-designated as National Statistics.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in 2020 all developments and recommendations were completed and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/" rel="external">Office for Statistics Regulation</a> published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-steve-ellerd-elliott-confirmation-of-national-statistics-designation-for-national-insurance-number-allocations-to-adult-overseas-nationals-entering-the-uk-statistics/" rel="external">letter to confirm</a> the re-instatement of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/list-of-national-statistics/" rel="external">National statistics badge</a> and compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>
</li>
  <li>from 2020, new narrative and data quality checks have been included to ensure continued quality in the data and explanation of changes impacted from COVID-19</li>
  <li>new data quality checks were added to understand the impact of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Exit on quarterly volumes and data received and new narrative added to the publication to inform users of the impact</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nationality of working age benefit claimants</h3>

<p>These annual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-insurance-number-allocations-to-adult-overseas-nationals-entering-the-uk">Nationality of working age benefit claimants statistics</a> reflect the nationality of the total number (stock) of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit claimants at a particular point in time. They reflect the nationality at the point of <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr> registration and provide breakdowns by nationality, place of residence and benefits claimed.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to meet user demand, including Freedom of Information requests, the August 2020 publication was extended to include low level nationality and new benefit breakdowns were included to provide greater consistency with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Benefit Combinations statistics and to provide a fuller picture of the benefits data</li>
  <li>to ensure greater consistency with Benefit combinations data, the benefit breakdown of the data was maximised to 95% of all breakdowns</li>
  <li>to add further context and narrative to the statistics, nationality at the point of <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr> registration of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> working age benefit recipients was added to the full statistical summary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universal Credit</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/universal-credit-statistics">Universal Credit statistics</a> have been developed to provide information about people and households on Universal Credit, and claims and starts to Universal Credit.</p>

<p>The main statistical release for claims, starts, people and households on Universal Credit is published quarterly. This is supplemented by monthly updates of data for people on Universal Credit. All data are available via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>, interactive maps and dashboard, and the quarterly statistical bulletin which is published on GOV.UK in HTML format.</p>

<p>Changes delivered since April 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Office for Statistics Regulation undertook a compliance check on the series and work to make improvements in line with the Code of Practice and specific recommendations was complete in 2020:
    <ul>
      <li>more detail was added to the background and methodology document including: an explanation of how administrative data is converted to official statistics, a quality assessment of the statistics and a glossary of technical terms used in the statistics</li>
      <li>data visualisation was also improved to aid interpretation of the statistics and the commentary was enhanced to provide further context and insight to users about trends in the statistics</li>
      <li>a Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (<abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr>) report and a Background Quality report were developed and published</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>in 2017, a consultation was ran to help identify and prioritise the future development of Universal Credit statistics as published in our release strategy. In line with the prioritisation and to meet user needs statistics detailing the number of households affected by the removal of the spare-room subsidy, and the average value of their deductions was added to the February 2021 publication</li>
  <li>to meet user demand the February 2021 publication was extended to split Universal Credit households by their work capability assessment (<abbr title="work capability assessment">WCA</abbr>) elements</li>
  <li>inclusion of wards on Stat-Xplore for People on Universal Credit and Households on Universal Credit from June 2021</li>
  <li>inclusion of the number of children in households claiming Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>), and the age of the youngest child in each household from August 2021</li>
  <li>inclusion of households affected by the removal of the spare-room subsidy (<abbr title="removal of the spare-room subsidy">RSRS</abbr>), and the average value of their deduction, from November 2021</li>
</ul>
