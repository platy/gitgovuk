<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>This publication sets out the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) statistical work programme. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is the UK’s largest public service department responsible for both policy and reporting of areas including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employment</li>
  <li>pensions</li>
  <li>poverty</li>
  <li>welfare</li>
  <li>benefit expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>The statistical work programme outlines developments to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> official statistics. It reports changes delivered from April 2020 in statistical methodology and specific measures used in areas such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing</li>
  <li>income</li>
  <li>employment</li>
  <li>welfare</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this document brings together both publication-specific and cross-departmental plans for future developments into a single programme.</p>

<p>The statistical work programme has been released to remain transparent about our official statistics, adhering to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policy-statement-on-the-revision-of-dwp-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> revision policy</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dwp-statistics-user-engagement-strategy"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics user engagement strategy</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/the-code" rel="external">UK Statistics Authority’s Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<p>The variety of data sources, collection techniques and statistical measures implemented by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is reflected in the range of future developments. These developments may be in one of several domains such as dissemination techniques, where a team may update terminology or reporting-style to improve the accessibility of publications; or could be technology-centric, involving plans to incorporate online tools such as Stat-Xplore.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> official statistics are produced and published in line with the 3 pillars of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trustworthiness – by committing to the highest standards of integrity and transparency</li>
  <li>Quality – by regularly assessing our methodology and exploring opportunities for development and synergy between teams – hence the introduction of a Statistical Work Programme</li>
  <li>Value – by remaining engaged with the main users and stakeholders of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> official statistics.</li>
</ol>

<p>The statistical work programme is published in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/the-code/trustworthiness/t4-transparent-processes-and-management/" rel="external">T4.2 of the Code of Practice for Statistics</a> to ensure that we are open and transparent about our progress towards meeting our priorities and objectives whilst ensuring users and stakeholders can help us prioritise our statistical plans.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Statistics at <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts are committed to producing accurate, timely, high quality official statistics publications to inform government policy development and operational decision-making.  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> takes into account user needs and produces and disseminates its statistics in accordance with the<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/the-code" rel="external"> UK Statistics Authority’s Code of Practice</a> for Statistics. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Official Statistics are used by a range of users, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Ministers</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy and operational officials</li>
  <li>Ministers and officials in other government departments</li>
  <li>Parliament</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>external interest groups</li>
  <li>the media and external commentators</li>
  <li>academics</li>
  <li>charities</li>
  <li>members of the public</li>
</ul>

<p>The department currently releases around 40 Official and National statistics series each year, as well as collaborating to support a number of cross-government publications. Further detail of types of official statistics is on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics" rel="external">UK Statistics Authority website</a>.</p>

<p>A full list of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical publications can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c">Annex C</a>.</p>

<p>Statistical publications are announced in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics&amp;organisations%5B%5D=department-for-work-pensions">GOV.UK statistics release calendar</a> and published on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/statistics"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics GOV.UK page</a>.</p>

<p>The department disseminates its statistics in a variety of ways, as for any set of statistics there could be a range of users accessing the data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-maintenance-service-statistics-data-to-september-2019-experimental/child-maintenance-service-statistics-data-to-september-2019-great-britain">first release statistical bulletins</a> include simple headline findings, text and graphs. The statistics are put into context and include footnotes and caveats. Alongside the bulletins, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> publishes methodology documents which include details of the users and uses of the statistics, how data is collected and processed, the quality assurance process and provides contextual information to aid understanding of the statistics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/851470/national-tables-child-maintenance-service-to-september-2019.ods" rel="external">statistical tables</a> provide what the department sees as the most important breakdowns meeting most user needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> is an interactive open data tool to interrogate data where the user can build their own tables and graphs with full level of granularity available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/metadata/dashboards/bc/index.html" rel="external">interactive maps and dashboards</a> enable the user to explore and customise <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The varied approach to disseminating statistics is in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/quality-guidelines-for-dwp-statistics">department’s quality policy</a>.</p>

<p>As well as producing and developing statistics, we also provide comprehensive briefing for ministers and policy teams and draft responses to numerous Parliamentary Questions, Freedom of Information requests and ad hoc queries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Developing how we deliver <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics</h2>

<p>There are new approaches and tools available that can improve our data, processes and dissemination of statistics. This will increase efficiency, drive up quality and allow us to add more value and insight. To make this happen we are investing time and resource to take forward developments and raise capability for users inside <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, across government and external, including academics, the media and the public.</p>

<p>Each development to our statistics follows a 4-stage process.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Stage 1: Discovery stage – user requirements for new statistics and proposed changes to existing statistics are gathered by statisticians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 2: Internal user engagement – liaising with internal stakeholders including policy, operations and external communications and Ministers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 3: Public consultation – active engagement with external users on the change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 4: Publication – approved changes are confirmed with users.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have 5 priority areas for cross-departmental development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user engagement</li>
  <li>examine-a-stat</li>
  <li>reproducible analytical pipelines</li>
  <li>devolution</li>
  <li>linking survey administrative data</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span> User Engagement</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is aware of the importance and the need to engage with its users and has utilised expert advice from the Government Statistical Service (<abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr>) to support this engagement.</p>

<p>Within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, user engagement is used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prioritise statistical work, for example to consider whether to produce new statistics to meet identified information gaps; continue, discontinue or adapt existing statistical series</li>
  <li>understand and refresh our understanding of the use and potential use of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics and data</li>
  <li>understand user satisfaction with the relevance and usefulness of our statistics</li>
  <li>maximise the use of our statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>This is in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-strategy-for-statistics-ensuring-official-statistics-meet-societys-need/#time-resource-and-opportunity" rel="external">User Engagement Strategy for Statistics</a> released by the <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dwp-statistics-user-engagement-strategy"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> User Engagement Strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The 3 goals of the strategy are to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Collaborate across boundaries to offer a more coherent user experience</li>
  <li>Build capability and equip producers of statistics with the practical skills and tools to deliver effective user engagement activities</li>
  <li>Strengthen our culture and ensure user engagement is always an ongoing and essential part of a statistics producers role</li>
</ol>

<p>Alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/" rel="external">Strategy the Code of Practice for Statistics</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Users of statistics and data should be at the centre of statistical production; their needs should be understood, their views sought and acted upon, and their use of statistics supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has multiple products that enhance its user engagement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stat-Xplore is <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s open data tool, providing a guided way to explore benefit related data sets for over 7,000 users, spanning a range of subject areas and statistical reports now up to 25 – and growing</li>
  <li>The visualisation dashboards, our web applications, which we use to gather experience and delve into innovative ways to explore and visualise the data sets of our major statistical publications</li>
  <li>User consultations to seek up to date feedback on our statistical products. For example, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> held a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/dwp-statistics-publication-frequency-statistical-notice">consultation in 2019</a> with users of a number of their statistical publications, so as to gauge the value of the current frequency of releases</li>
  <li>Active engagement through publication team in-boxes and statistician lead contacts. Details of how to contact each publication team are found on each publication. In each publication, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> asks for feedback from the user</li>
  <li>The Family Finance Survey User Conference is held every year and brings together <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> colleagues and users of survey publications to share ideas for developing the publications as well as to gain a better understanding of how the statistics are used. In 2019, approximately 60 people attended from academic institutions, think tanks and government departments. In 2020, the conference took place virtually, with around 80 attendees</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is always striving to improve user engagement and has projects in development to meet that objective.</p>

<p>These projects are detailed in the following sections.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2. </span> Examine-a-Stat</h3>

<p>Examine-a-Stat is an interactive statistical tool currently under development. This tool will be publicly accessible, and will allow the user to customise <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s statistical bulletins to suit their needs, while retaining the commentary, descriptions and key information they need to know to properly understand the data. Users will be able to view Official Statistics publications in as much or as little detail as they would like, with both figures and text adjusting to be relevant to the selected breakdown.</p>

<p>The department will incorporate other interfaces, such as those for users with less familiarity of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics, assisting them in finding data relevant to their interests.</p>

<p>The data for National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr>) Allocations to adult overseas nationals, Alternative Claimant Count, Universal Credit, Benefit Cap and Personal Independence Payment publications have been integrated and the Department is currently consulting with users of those publications for suggested improvements. The appropriate platform will be deployed in 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3. </span> Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (<abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> project will simplify and accelerate the publication process of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical publications. The scope of its development is not only to make the publication of key statistics in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> faster, but to ensure a wide variety of long-term benefits. These benefits include consistency across publications, quality of outputs to avoid manual or human error, accessibility of the statistical production, and most importantly, reproducibility of the outputs through a transparent and consistent process.</p>

<p>Currently the publication process of a statistical bulletin is a manual process; the <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> product will make this process faster and automated. <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> will enable publication teams to bypass a lot of the manual work by having a shorter process from data collection to publication. The development of <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> also fits with the wider <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr> strategy and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> strategic objectives of transforming digital services.</p>

<h4>Phase 1</h4>

<p>Phase 1 of the project concluded in Spring 2021 which generated the <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> framework using <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr> principles and set the foundation for how <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> will be implemented in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. As part of Phase 1 we used open-source software to generate a partial pipeline to supplement all of the end-of-line processes, including data retrieval and markdown generation for publication on gov.uk. The National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr>) Allocations publication was used as a pilot and was successfully produced using <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> after successful consecutive parallel runs. The infrastructure for three other statistical publications, including the Alternative Claimant Count, Universal Credit and the Work and Health Programme has been created and will be used in Phase 2 of the project. Also, as part of Phase 1, we delivered a robust Git repository containing the delivered <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> product, as a package and ready to implement, structured training material with several courses which details expected outcomes and time taken, and also documentation to help statistical product leads plan their resource, time and workload accordingly.</p>

<h4>Phase 2</h4>

<p>Phase 2 of the project began in late Spring 2021 and its conclusion is dependent on a wider <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> remediation project which looks to bring more open-source software into the Department to support future ways of working. This phase of the project will look to extend the scope of <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> from a partial, end-of-line process to a full robust pipeline by designing how these tools will integrate with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data and using the <abbr title="Reproducible Analytical Pipelines">RAP</abbr> principles designed by <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr>. This will include the upskilling of colleagues, designing thorough documentation for future processes, understanding what the wider remediation project will bring and replicating this environment with pseudo-data to prepare for the delivery of remediation (currently expected in 2022).</p>

<h4>Phase 3</h4>

<p>Phase 3 of the project will begin in 2022 and look to integrate the work done in Phase 2 onto <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems to fully automate statistical publications from point of data entry to release on GOV.UK. This will use <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINo</abbr> data as a pilot exercise to move to open source. Once a successful pilot has been undertaken, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will look to extend this to other benefit publications, including Universal Credit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4. </span> Devolution</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/11/contents/enacted" rel="external">Scotland Act 2016</a> received Royal Assent in March 2016. The Social Security (Scotland) Bill received Royal Assent on 1 June 2018. As a result, legislative and delivery powers are being devolved to the Scottish Government in several areas.</p>

<p>The transfer of benefits to the Scottish Government will impact on the Official Statistics that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> produce. Official Statistics impacted include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Benefit Combinations</li>
  <li>Cold Weather Payments</li>
  <li>Winter Fuel Payment</li>
  <li>Alternative Claimant Count</li>
  <li>Children in Low Income Families</li>
</ul>

<p>From September 2018, recipients of Carer’s Allowance who live in Scotland have been eligible for Carer’s Allowance Supplement, which will raise their Carer’s Allowance to the equivalent of the current rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance for 25 and over. Carer’s Allowance Supplement payments are paid twice a year to people who are in receipt of Carer’s Allowance on the Carer’s Allowance Supplement eligibility dates set by the Scottish Government (April and October). Social Security Scotland have published information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/about/statistics/social-security-scotland-statistics-publications" rel="external">recipients of Carer’s Allowance Supplement</a>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to publish the same Carer’s Allowance statistics as we do currently that cover the whole of Great Britain.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2020, the Scottish Government became responsible for disability and industrial injury benefits for people living in Scotland. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will however continue to deliver these benefits on behalf of Scottish Government, on the same basis as prior to 1 April 2020, until the Scottish Government introduces its own replacement benefits. This will happen in the next few years but with some delay due to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on Scottish Government plans for the transfer.</p>

<p>Child Disability Payment is the first of the application-based disability benefits to be introduced by the Scottish Government. It replaces Disability Living Allowance for children that was administered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. From 26 July 2021, new applications were taken in Scotland for Child Disability Payment for children under 16 that live in the pilot areas of Dundee City, Na h-Eileanan Siar and Perth and Kinross. On 22 November 2021, Child Disability Payment launched nationwide to all new applicants living in Scotland.</p>

<p>The Disability Living Allowance figures presented to the end of August 2021 overlapped with the launch of Child Disability Payment in the pilot areas in Scotland detailed above. This overlap accounts for approximately 5 weeks where new applications for Child Disability Payment in these areas were taken. Data on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/about/statistics/social-security-scotland-statistics-publications" rel="external">applications and payments</a> made for this time period is available. Due to the short time period and limited areas that applicants could apply from, the number of applications received were small and have had a very limited impact on Disability Living Allowance for child numbers. The next release of Child Disability Payment statistics will be August 2022.</p>

<p>Adult Disability Payment is the second of the application-based disability benefits to be introduced by the Scottish Government. It replaces Personal Independence Payment that was administered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. From 21 March 2022, new applications were taken in Scotland for Adult Disability Payment for those who live in the pilot areas of Dundee City, Na h-Eileanan Siar and Perth and Kinross. Adult Disability Payment will launch nationwide to all new applicants living in Scotland from August 2022.</p>

<p>The Personal Independence Payment figures presented to the end of April 2022 overlaps with the launch of Adult Disability Payment in the pilot areas in Scotland detailed above. This overlap accounts for approximately 6 weeks where new applications for Adult Disability Payment in these areas were taken. Data on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2022/06/adult-disability-payment-high-level-statistics-to-30-april-2022/documents/adult-disability-payment-high-level-statistics-to-30-april-2022/adult-disability-payment-high-level-statistics-to-30-april-2022/govscot%3Adocument/Adult%2BDisability%2BPayment%2B-%2BPublication%2B-%2BJune%2B2022.pdf" rel="external">applications and payment</a> made for this time period is available. Due to the short time period and limited areas that applicants could apply from, the number of applications received were small and have had a very limited impact on Personal Independence Payment numbers. The next release of Adult Disability Payment statistics will be September 2022.</p>

<p>Scottish Devolution will also impact the fraud and error in the benefit system publication. Existing publications include data from Scotland; however, the volume of data does not allow for breakdown of results any more granular than at the <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>-level. The publication does not include the Scottish Government Carer’s Allowance supplement.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will need to vary its approach for the presentation of disability statistics, as administration of some caseloads moves from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the Scottish Government.</p>

<p>During 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will agree publication principles with Scottish Government that ensure that user needs are met, in line with Code of Practice for Statistics and Statistics and Registration Services Act 2007.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5. </span> Linking survey and administrative data</h3>

<p>With changes introduced by General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) in 2018, the department now has a firm legal basis to link all survey respondents to their administrative records.</p>

<p>This has opened the opportunity to transform the department’s survey analysis through the integration of administrative data.</p>

<p>The first step is to develop a robust data linking approach which delivers a high rate of good quality matches.  The approach needs to be repeatable for future implementation into routine processing.</p>

<p>In line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/datastrategy/dataprinciples" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Digital data strategy</a>, the department is committed to transforming its surveys by linking administrative data from the full range of available sources (for example, from other government departments).</p>

<span class="number">7. </span> Annex A: Statistical reviews and developments</h2>

<p>In addition to our cross-cutting development work on how we deliver statistics, and the changes we are making to our statistical publications, we are also involved in responding to feedback from external reviews and have other statistical development work which forms part of our statistical work programme.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> review of income-based poverty statistics</h3>

<p>The Office for Statistics Regulation (<abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr>) published its review of Income-based poverty statistics on 19 May 2021. The report includes 20 recommendations.</p>

<p>A number of recommendations relate to improved guidance in our publications. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>producers should look to provide clearer and more detailed signposting to other income-based poverty statistics in their bulletins</li>
  <li>producers should ensure supporting guidance is accessible to lay users and clear on the appropriate uses and quality of the statistics</li>
  <li>producers should consider the helpfulness of the language used in the poverty bulletins and accompanying guidance, to ensure that it does not risk confusing or misleading less-experienced users</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> should ensure they are clear about the strengths and limitations of household surveys, particularly with regards to missing groups, and clearly set out the implicit and explicit assumptions that underline them</li>
  <li>producers should do more to draw out the necessary insights to allow users to understand the nature of poverty and how this varies between groups at differing levels of poverty, as identified above</li>
</ul>

<p>We will take these on board in future publications starting from the next annual publications planned for March 2022.</p>

<p>A number of recommendations relate to developments in the use of integrated survey and administrative data. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the strategic recommendation that innovation is needed for the statistics to deliver their full potential and serve the public good – opportunities for data linkage should be maximised and data gaps should be addressed, building on work already underway in the <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr> to explore the use of administrative data and its integration with social surveys</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, building on existing work to explore the feasibility and potential of social survey and administrative data integration, should explore whether integration can help improve the timeliness and robustness of income-based poverty statistics</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> should prioritise work to address under-reporting at the bottom end of the income distribution – they should consider a multifaceted approach to solving this problem, such as data linkage and making greater use of administrative data</li>
</ul>

<p>Our existing long-term work programme developing integrated survey-administrative datasets <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec-two">(see section 2.5)</a> will meet the aims of these objectives in the future.</p>

<p>From March 2022, some recommendations have been included in the following publications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/family-resources-survey--2">Family Resources Survey</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">Households Below Average Income</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/income-dynamics-statistics">Income Dynamics</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Family Resources Survey (<abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr>) boost</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is taking forward plans for a significant boost to the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> sample size with the aim to increase the achieved sample to 45,000 households annually from April 2022.</p>

<p>A number of recommendations in the review of Income-based poverty statistics relate to data gaps and improving the evidence base for small groups. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> should address the ethnicity data gap, as part of the wider <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr> response to the findings of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities’ report</li>
  <li>the strategic recommendation that innovation is needed for the statistics to deliver their full potential and serve the public good – opportunities for data linkage should be maximised and data gaps should be addressed, building on work already underway in the <abbr title="Government Statistical Service">GSS</abbr> to explore the use of administrative data and its integration with social surveys</li>
</ul>

<p>For our statistics based on the <abbr title="Family Resources Survey">FRS</abbr> the planned significant sample boost will help to fill some evidence gaps.</p>

<p>We will update users on our plans as they develop.</p>
