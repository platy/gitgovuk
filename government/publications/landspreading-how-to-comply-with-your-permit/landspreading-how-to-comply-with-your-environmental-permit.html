<p>This guidance is for operators with the following permits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SR2010 No 4: mobile plant for landspreading (land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement)</li>
  <li>SR2010 No 5: mobile plant for the reclamation, restoration or land improvement</li>
  <li>SR2010 No 6: mobile plant for landspreading of sewage sludge</li>
  <li>bespoke mobile plant permit for landspreading or land reclamation – note that bespoke permits may have different conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>It explains how to meet the requirements of your permit. You need to read your permit alongside this guide.</p>

<p>All waste spread to land must result in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement. You must operate your activities in a way which identifies and minimises risks of pollution. For a definition of pollution you must read 4.4 Interpretation in your permit. See also the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-monitor-emissions-for-your-environmental-permit#pollution">pollution section</a> in the guidance Control and monitor emissions for your environmental permit.</p>

<p>To store or spread any waste to land you must apply for a deployment. You must not start any activities until we have agreed your Landspreading: form <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> application for deployment (<abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr>).</p>

<p>Your permit describes the objectives and outcomes that must be achieved. Use this guidance to help to meet them.</p>

<p>Where we refer to ‘must’ it means you have to do something to meet the requirements of the permit and deployment. The Environment Agency do not normally tell you how to achieve them. This gives you a degree of flexibility.</p>

<p>Where a permit requires you to take appropriate measures to secure a particular objective, we will expect you to use, as a minimum, the relevant measures described in this guidance. The measures set out here are not exhaustive and may not all be appropriate for a particular circumstance. You can put in place equivalent measures that achieve the same objective. For example, you may have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take additional measures to those set out in this guidance to ensure the objectives are met</li>
  <li>use other management systems and measures to achieve the same outcomes of protecting environmental and human receptors</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have appropriate measures or equivalent measures in place, including, but not limited to those specified in any approved emissions management plan, you will not be found to have breached the permit rule. You must be able to show that you have prevented or where that is not practicable, minimised the risks.</p>

<p>If you think you may not be able to comply with your permit you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">contact your local Environment Agency office</a>.</p>

<h2>Introductory note</h2>

<p>Your permit has an introductory note. This is not part of the standard rules. It summarises the activities you can do and how and where you can do them.</p>

<p>You must make sure your permit is suitable for the operations you intend to do.</p>

<p>If there is a site-based permit on the land where you want to store or spread you cannot do the activities under a landspreading mobile plant permit where the site-based permit’s requirements differ. Where there are 2 permits the requirements of the site-based permit must come first. For advice on this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">contact your local Environment Agency office</a>.</p>

<h3>Meet other regulatory requirements</h3>

<p>You must make sure that you do not breach any other regulatory requirements such as the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nitrate Pollution Regulations – if you are in a nitrate vulnerable zone see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-nitrogen-fertilisers-in-nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Using nitrogen fertilisers in nitrate vulnerable zones</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/storing-organic-manures-in-nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Storing organic manures in nitrate vulnerable zones</a>
</li>
  <li>Reduction and Prevention of Agricultural Diffuse Pollution Regulations (the farming rules for water) – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rules-for-farmers-and-land-managers-to-prevent-water-pollution">Rules for farmers and land managers to prevent water pollution</a>
</li>
  <li>Animal By-Products Regulations (<abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>SR2010 No 4 and some bespoke permits refer to the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr> control the risks to human and animal health from handling, treating, storing and disposing of animal by-products (<abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>). You must meet the requirements of the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr> for any wastes controlled by these regulations. The Animal and Plant Health Agency have responsibility for the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/landspreading-benefits-and-risks-of-the-waste-types-you-can-use">Landspreading: benefits and risks of the waste types you can use</a> lists the wastes controlled by the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr>.</p>

<p>If your deployment includes any waste streams that are <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>, the <abbr title="Animal By-Products Regulations">ABPR</abbr> controls may also apply to your activity. For example, you can only feed livestock with herbage from land to which ABP or ABP derived products have been applied after the waiting period ends. This applies to grazing or feeding with cut herbage.</p>

<p>If you are dealing with <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> you must follow the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/guidance-for-the-animal-by-product-industry">Guidance for the animal by-product industry</a></li>

<p>See also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal">Animal by-product categories, site approval, hygiene and disposal</a>. This explains what <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> are, how to set up your site safely, the paperwork you need, and how to dispose of them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Management</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> General management</h3>

<p>This section explains how to follow the general management rules.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 Operator responsibilities</h4>

<p>The permit holder is called the operator. They must be both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/legal-operator-and-competence-requirements-environmental-permits#what-a-legal-operator-is">legal operator of the facility</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>considered a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/legal-operator-and-competence-requirements-environmental-permits#what-a-competent-operator-is">competent operator</a> by the Environment Agency</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An operator could be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>waste producer</li>
  <li>waste management business, including compost or anaerobic digestate operators</li>
  <li>waste broker</li>
  <li>farmer or land manager</li>
  <li>land agent</li>
  <li>consultant</li>
</ul>

<p>You must have sufficient control over your landspreading operations. For example, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have day-to-day control of the operations</li>
  <li>make sure your staff and subcontractors meet the permit rules</li>
  <li>decide who holds responsible staff positions</li>
  <li>make sure the staff are trained and competent</li>
  <li>make investment and financial decisions that affect performance or how the activity is done</li>
  <li>take control in emergencies</li>
</ul>

<p>You may subcontract parts of your landspreading operation. For example, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a local agricultural contractor for field operations</li>
  <li>get appropriate technical expertise to prepare your benefit statement such as a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.factsinfo.org.uk/facts/home.eb" rel="external">fertiliser advisers certification and training scheme</a> (<abbr title="Fertiliser advisors certification and training scheme">FACTS</abbr>) qualified adviser</li>
</ul>

<p>If you subcontract, you must always keep control of your operations. You must be able to provide evidence of this if we ask for it.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 (a) Produce a written management system</h4>

<p>You must produce and follow a written management system. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the risks your operations may cause to the environment</li>
  <li>take action to prevent or minimise those risks</li>
</ul>

<p>You must follow the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/develop-a-management-system-environmental-permits">Develop a management system: environmental permits</a>.</p>

<p>Your management system must describe how you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manage and train your staff, contractors and subcontractors</li>
  <li>decide if a waste is suitable for landspreading, including how you will check its source and confirm it is as described</li>
  <li>make sure the waste storage facilities you use are suitably designed, constructed, operated and maintained</li>
  <li>handle the waste and transfer it into and out of the storage facilities</li>
  <li>select the receiving land</li>
  <li>select the technique for applying the waste to the land</li>
  <li>calibrate and maintain your machinery to demonstrate accurate application of the waste</li>
  <li>handle and manage odorous wastes</li>
</ul>

<p>You must document how you will keep control of your activities. For example, you must make sure all management staff, operational staff and subcontractors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand the requirements of other related environmental legislation such as waste duty of care and hazardous waste rules – see 2.2 Waste acceptance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know that landspreading is waste recovery not disposal and what this means – you must meet all 5 waste recovery tests as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-produce-a-benefit-statement">Landspreading: produce a benefit statement</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know when recovery becomes disposal – for example, by exceeding the needs of the soil and the crop</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understand the causes and effects of pollution and know what controls are needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimise the risk of pollution and harm to human and animal health, by using for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protecting-our-water-soil-and-air">Protecting our water, soil and air</a> – a code of good agricultural practice for farmers, growers and land managers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow site safety and risk assessments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do routine inspections and maintenance of all mobile plant and equipment to prevent waste oils, hydraulic fluids and fuels spilling or leaking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have and follow an emergency procedure for dealing with spills or leaks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understand when conditions for landspreading are unsuitable or if the land is not available – landspreading wastes in unsuitable conditions may be a disposal activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have access to the deployment form and the supporting documents for each deployment – including our written agreement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have access to the location map to know where any sensitive receptors are and to comply with buffer zones</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Plan for interruptions to field operations</h4>

<p>You must include a plan for how you will minimise the effects on the environment from short-term disruptions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>machinery breakdown</li>
  <li>delivery problems</li>
  <li>staff shortages</li>
  <li>accidents that may result in pollution</li>
  <li>adverse weather conditions, including flooded or frozen ground</li>
</ul>

<h4>Plan for potential longer term disruptions</h4>

<p>Consider long-term disruptions, for example from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prolonged adverse weather, including likelihood of flooding</li>
  <li>notifiable disease outbreaks</li>
  <li>major disruptions to agriculture and food supply</li>
</ul>

<p>During long periods of exceptional circumstances, we may offer advice on the options available for storing and landspreading waste. These may be through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice and guidance</li>
  <li>regulatory position statements</li>
</ul>

<p>See for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-agricultural-pollution-in-exceptional-weather">Preventing agricultural pollution in exceptional circumstances</a>.</p>

<p>You need suitable contingency arrangements in place. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>machinery service and repair contracts to get repairs done quickly</li>
  <li>access to more than one machine, or arrangements for hire</li>
  <li>enough staff to cover sickness, holiday and other absence</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider getting more waste storage capacity. For example, at the waste producer’s site or at a suitably permitted site. You must not exceed the storage limits in your deployment form.</p>

<h4>Keep your management system up to date</h4>

<p>You must keep your management system up to date and do regular reviews.</p>

<p>For an incident or non-compliance, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify us without delay</li>
  <li>deal with it immediately</li>
  <li>amend your accident prevention and management plan</li>
  <li>tell us about any amendments you make</li>
  <li>explain and justify the reasons for any failures</li>
</ul>

<p>4.3 Notifications explains how you must notify us.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 (b) Use sufficient competent persons and resources</h4>

<p>As the operator you are responsible for permit compliance.</p>

<p>You must follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/legal-operator-and-competence-requirements-environmental-permits">Legal operator and competence requirements</a>.</p>

<h4>Technically competent manager</h4>

<p>You must have a technically competent manager.</p>

<p>The technically competent manager can be the operator (permit holder) or the person responsible for demonstrating technical competence.</p>

<p>You can also appoint one (or more) nominated competent person as the main contact for specific deployments. They must report to the technically competent manager. In your management system you must show how they will be managed.</p>

<p>You must name your technically competent manager and nominated competent person in your permit application and on your deployment form.</p>

<p>You will only need a nominated competent person when the technically competent manager cannot supervise all the deployments. Where deployments are some distance from the main office or countrywide, you must be able to show you have control of all day to day operations. You will do this through your management system and any formal contracts you have in place.</p>

<p>They must have access to the permit and understand the requirements of the permit, guidance and supporting deployment documents.</p>

<h4>Nominated competent person</h4>

<p>Your nominated competent person may be an employee, contractor or consultant. You must have a formal written contract with them. It must state their role and responsibilities.</p>

<p>They need to show they have sufficient training in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>waste management legislation and associated requirements</li>
  <li>environmental risk assessment</li>
  <li>environmental protection measures</li>
  <li>your management system and procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>They can do this through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>formal qualifications such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ciwmquals.co.uk/qualification-sectors/" rel="external">Waste Management Industry Training and Advisory Board</a> (<abbr title="Waste Management Industry Training and Advisory Board">WAMITAB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a documented in-house training programme</li>
</ul>

<p>See 1.1.4 Approved competence scheme.</p>

<p>Your management system must include evidence of their qualifications.</p>

<p>Your nominated competent person will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be able to contact the technically competent manager if needed</li>
  <li>get to the deployment site within 2 hours during landspreading and 4 hours at any other time</li>
  <li>make sure the storage and spreading activities follow the deployment</li>
  <li>have the authority to give approval to start or stop the landspreading, for example due to weather conditions – they must use a dynamic risk assessment as described in rule 2.3.2</li>
  <li>make sure the person delivering the waste to the site knows where and how to store the waste</li>
  <li>make sure that any person spreading the waste knows of any ‘no spread’ or buffer zones and any actions they need to take to protect sensitive receptors</li>
  <li>raise any issues with the technically competent manager that could cause a permit breach</li>
  <li>be the first person to respond to any incidents or non-conformances including noise, dust or odour issues (if the technically competent manager is unavailable)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.1.2 Records</h4>

<p>You must show you have met rule 1.1.1 by keeping written records of your operations.</p>

<h4>1.1.3 Access to permit</h4>

<p>Your staff and subcontractors must have access to the relevant permit. They will need to follow your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>management system</li>
  <li>management plans for emissions, odour, noise and vibration</li>
  <li>deployment form, location map, benefit statement and any site-specific risk assessment</li>
  <li>requirements for record keeping</li>
</ul>

<p>They must understand the requirements of the permit and deployment.</p>

<h4>1.1.4 Approved competence scheme</h4>

<p>You must comply with the requirements of an approved competence scheme. Most landspreading applicants will use the government approved scheme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ciwmquals.co.uk/qualification-sectors/" rel="external"><abbr title="Waste Management Industry Training and Advisory Board">WAMITAB</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>You must follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/legal-operator-and-competence-requirements-environmental-permits">Legal operator and competence requirements</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Waste hierarchy</h3>

<p>To meet the waste hierarchy you must consider how you will prevent, reuse, recycle or recover waste in relation to your activities.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify all wastes that your operations may produce</li>
  <li>decide how you are going to manage them</li>
</ul>

<p>You must consider whether you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid producing the waste</li>
  <li>reduce the amount of waste that is produced</li>
</ul>

<p>Every 4 years you must review and record if any changes are needed. If your review shows you can improve how you prevent and reduce waste, you must adopt the changes.</p>

<p>For:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>non-hazardous waste types see the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applying-the-waste-hierarchy">Applying the waste hierarchy</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hazardous waste types see the <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-applying-the-waste-hierarchy-to-hazardous-waste">Applying the waste hierarchy to hazardous waste</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must be able to meet all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-produce-a-benefit-statement#section-2-waste-recovery-without-harm">5 waste recovery tests</a> as set out in Landspreading: produce a benefit statement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Operations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Permitted activities</h3>

<p>Your permit allows the following recovery activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R13 – the temporary secure storage of waste you will spread to land</li>
  <li>R10 – land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>The R prefix stands for recovery.</p>

<p>Your landspreading mobile plant permit and deployment form do not allow you to treat the waste. You need a different type of permit for this.</p>

<p>Also, you must not treat any waste if you hold the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S3 waste exemption for storing sludge</li>
  <li>SR2010 No 17: storage of wastes to be used in land treatment standard rules permit</li>
</ul>

<p>Screening, sorting or crushing waste is classed as treatment.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 R13 storing waste before you spread</h4>

<p>Use this information to also meet rule 2.3.1 Storage.</p>

<p>You can only store the waste as described in your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>permit</li>
  <li>deployment form</li>
  <li>waste analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not bring any waste onto your site until we have agreed your deployment application. See rule 2.1.4.</p>

<p>The waste you store for landspreading must be suitable for direct use. It must not have or require any treatment. It must be suitably stable so that when stored it does not result in any significant biological, physical or chemical changes.</p>

<p>You must contact us if you need to treat the waste before you store or spread it. You may need to have it treated at a facility with a suitable permit. Following any treatment, you must get a new waste analysis done before you can store or spread it. You must get agreement from us to do this.</p>

<p>When we assess your deployment application we will check the place of storage you propose meets the limits of the R13 activity. It must be within the scope of mobile plant activities - the requirements are set out in in Regulatory guidance note 2 (<abbr title="Regulatory guidance note 2">RGN2</abbr>) Understanding the meaning of regulated facility – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rgn-2-understanding-the-meaning-of-regulated-facility">Appendix 4 Understanding the scope of mobile plant</a>.</p>

<h4>Planning permission</h4>

<p>Waste operations, including some mobile plant deployments, may need planning permission. For example, you may need it for some types for storage such as lagoons. Your local planning authority can advise.</p>

<h4>Waste types you can store</h4>

<p>The waste code and description must be listed in the mobile plant permit. You can only receive and store the waste streams listed in your deployment form.</p>

<p>A waste stream is a single waste generated by a single site. You must not receive any waste streams on the site until we have agreed your deployment. See rule 2.1.4 in your permit.</p>

<h4>Place of storage</h4>

<p>R13 refers to secure storage at the place where the waste is to be used for land treatment. This is called the ‘place of storage.’</p>

<p>You must make sure that the place of storage is within the spreading area covered by your deployment. For example, this can be secure storage on a field headland or concrete pad at the entrance of the field you will treat.</p>

<p>You must tell us in your <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> application and show on the location map the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>areas of land you will treat</li>
  <li>place of storage – the place on that land you will securely store the waste</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not store waste:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with other materials, including non-waste</li>
  <li>at an intermediate site that is not the ‘place of storage’ where you will use it</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot meet the waste storage requirements of your permit and deployment form you must apply for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>site-based permit such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sr2010-no17-storage-of-digestate-from-anaerobic-digestion-plants">SR2010 No 17: storage of wastes to be used in land treatment</a>
</li>
  <li>bespoke permit for waste storage</li>
</ul>

<h4>Store waste securely</h4>

<p>You must store the waste securely.</p>

<p>You must have approval to use any storage facility provided by a third party such as the land owner or occupier. You, as the operator, are responsible for the facility providing secure storage.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep the waste away from members of the public, for example by locating field stockpiles away from public rights of way</li>
  <li>contain the waste stream within the facility – it must not escape or leak</li>
  <li>be able to show the facility is always maintained</li>
  <li>consider other relevant properties of the waste and any associated risk and benefits from its storage</li>
  <li>if you are using third party storage, document your approach in your management system</li>
</ul>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fit lockable valves and use secondary containment to prevent the waste leaking or spilling, unless you are using other relevant measures</li>
  <li>keep the amount of waste you store to a minimum, for example by getting daily deliveries and using it that day, to manage odour such as for some 02 02 coded wastes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Quantity of waste allowed</h4>

<p>Your deployment form will specify the actual quantity of waste you can store. This may be less than the maximum quantity allowed under your permit.</p>

<p>Under your permit, for a single deployment, you can only store up to 3,000 tonnes of waste that you will spread in a location at any one time. Of this you must not store more than 1,250 tonnes of non‐stackable waste.</p>

<p>If you hold, or are applying for, more than one deployment that covers the same area, you must store no more than 3,000 tonnes of waste in a single location at any one time. Of this, you can store no more than 1,250 tonnes of non-stackable waste.</p>

<p>The total quantity of waste you will store must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within the limits given in your permit and be no greater than that detailed in the deployment</li>
  <li>stored in line with any other permit or exemption requirements</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stackable and non-stackable waste</h4>

<p>Stackable waste must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be solid enough to stack in a free‐standing heap without slumping</li>
  <li>not give rise to free drainage of liquid from within the stacked material</li>
</ul>

<p>All other waste is classed as non-stackable and can include liquids and slurries.</p>

<p>For how you must store stackable and non-stackable waste see rule 2.3.1.</p>

<p>You will need to consider the benefits and risks from different types of storage and explain these in the relevant sections your benefit statement.</p>

<h4>Benefits and risks of storing stackable waste</h4>

<p>Consider using a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>field heap</li>
  <li>on-field concrete pad or hard standing</li>
  <li>farm building, yard area, or silage clamp</li>
</ul>

<h4>Field heap</h4>

<p>You must comply with rule 2.3.1 Operating techniques.</p>

<p>A field heap can be easy to set up and simple to use. The benefits can include that it can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>close to the spreading area</li>
  <li>kept small and topped up with deliveries during spreading</li>
</ul>

<p>The risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pollution from leachate moving through land drains or surface run-off</li>
  <li>odour and dust</li>
  <li>pests and scavengers</li>
  <li>the potential for it to be unsightly</li>
  <li>mud and debris on adjacent roads from waste delivery and collection</li>
  <li>damage to the soil from nutrient enrichment</li>
  <li>damage to the soil from compaction and rutting by machinery</li>
</ul>

<p>You must be able to meet the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rules-for-farmers-and-land-managers-to-prevent-water-pollution#storing-manure">Rules for farmers and land managers to prevent water pollution</a> (the farming rules for water) when deciding where to locate the field heap.</p>

<p>See also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/storing-organic-manures-in-nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Storing organic manures in nitrate vulnerable zones</a>.</p>

<h4>On-field concrete pad or hard standing</h4>

<p>You can use on-field concrete pads or hard standing for storing solid stackable wastes or siting mobile tankers.</p>

<p>This method allows for ease of handling when loading or unloading. It can provide a more efficient way of handling the waste.  For example, less spillage and damage to soil.</p>

<p>Benefits can include a reduced potential for damage to the soil from compaction and rutting by machinery.</p>

<p>The risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pollution from leachate, particularly if there is no collection facility such as an effluent tank</li>
  <li>odour and dust</li>
  <li>pests and scavengers</li>
  <li>the potential for it to be unsightly</li>
  <li>mud and debris on adjacent roads from waste delivery and collection</li>
  <li>a potential permit breach if it is not at the place where the waste will be used</li>
</ul>

<h4>Farm building, yard area, or silage clamp</h4>

<p>This method allows for ease of handling when loading or unloading.</p>

<p>Benefits can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contained leachate collection may be present</li>
  <li>secure storage</li>
</ul>

<p>The risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the potential for poor farm infrastructure causing pollution</li>
  <li>the proximity to sensitive receptors</li>
  <li>odour and dust</li>
  <li>pests and scavengers</li>
  <li>a potential permit breach if it is not at the place the waste will be used</li>
</ul>

<p>You must be able to meet rule 2.1 Place of storage. The place of storage must be within the spreading area covered by your deployment.</p>

<h4>Benefits and risks of storing non-stackable waste</h4>

<p>You must comply with rule 2.3.1 Operating techniques.</p>

<h4>Mobile tanker or a nurse tank</h4>

<p>This method can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be flexible</li>
  <li>be relocated to prevent damage to the soil</li>
  <li>provide secure storage</li>
  <li>reduce odour if it is a sealed container</li>
</ul>

<p>The risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>site security</li>
  <li>spillage and damage to the soil from nutrient enrichment at filling and draw off points</li>
  <li>damage to the soil from compaction and rutting by machinery</li>
  <li>mud and debris on adjacent roads from waste delivery and collection</li>
</ul>

<h4>Purpose-built lagoon or permanent tank</h4>

<p>Benefits include that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is a permanent engineered structure, such as a slurry store</li>
  <li>has a constructed access – reducing the risk of machinery damaging the soil by compacting or rutting</li>
</ul>

<p>The risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accidental mixing of waste with other materials in the tank</li>
  <li>site security</li>
  <li>rainwater collection</li>
  <li>not keeping an adequate freeboard</li>
  <li>lack of maintenance</li>
  <li>odour, pests and scavengers – if open topped</li>
  <li>a potential permit breach if it is not at the place the waste will be used</li>
</ul>

<h4>How long you can store waste</h4>

<p>You can store the waste for 12 months. The start date is the date we give our written agreement to the deployment. The end date is 12 months later.</p>

<p>You must spread all the waste and have no stored waste left at the site once the deployment has expired.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns that you have waste leftover you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">contact your local Environment Agency office</a> for advice.</p>

<p>We understand that you cannot always get the timing and conditions right for landspreading. You may temporarily store the waste until you spread it, when for example, adverse weather conditions have not allowed you to spread it. See changes you can make in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-form-lpd1-guidance">Landspreading: form <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<p>We are likely to consider your place of storage as a permanent facility if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is in constant use</li>
  <li>it stores a succession of temporary waste</li>
  <li>you regularly need to store waste after the deployment expires</li>
</ul>

<p>For these situations you must apply for a site-based permit such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sr2010-no17-storage-of-digestate-from-anaerobic-digestion-plants">SR2010 No 17: storage of wastes to be used in land treatment</a>.</p>

<h4>Storing mixed waste streams</h4>

<p>You must only mix waste for ease of handling before spreading.</p>

<p>For a single deployment you can mix and store up to 10 waste streams together.</p>

<p>If you are a single operator with multiple deployments for the same area of land, you can mix and store the wastes listed on your deployments together.</p>

<p>Where more than one operator holds deployments at the same site, they must each store their waste separately.</p>

<p>You can only mix hazardous wastes if you comply with the requirements for hazardous waste. These are set out in ‘accepting hazardous waste’ under 2.2 Waste acceptance.</p>

<p>Mixing the wastes must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cause wastes to react with each other</li>
  <li>pose a risk to human or animal health or the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>These examples of treatment are not allowed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>neutralisation</li>
  <li>changes in pH that may result in a change to metal availability</li>
  <li>using one waste stream to buffer or neutralise the acidic or alkali properties of another waste stream</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do mix waste together you must comply with the application rates for each waste stream given in your agreed deployment form.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-produce-a-benefit-statement#section-5-operational-details">meet the application rates from mixed waste streams</a> set out in section 5 of Landspreading: produce a benefit statement.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 R10 land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture or ecological improvement</h4>

<p>Your mobile plant permit must be suitable for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type of land you propose to treat – agricultural or non-agricultural</li>
  <li>waste types you intend to spread</li>
  <li>quantity of waste you intend to spread</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the definitions in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-form-lpd1-guidance">Landspreading: form <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> guidance</a> for agricultural and non-agricultural land.</p>

<p>When we assess your deployment application we will check that the land treatment activities meet the limits of the R10 activity. They must be within the scope of mobile plant activities – the requirements are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rgn-2-understanding-the-meaning-of-regulated-facility">Appendix 4 Understanding the scope of mobile plant</a> of <abbr title="Regulatory guidance note 2">RGN2</abbr>.</p>

<h4>R10 Table 2.1 activities</h4>

<p>You must refer to table 2.1 in your permit for the limits of the R10 activities you can do.</p>

<p>You:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can only spread waste within a 12-month period</li>
  <li>must be able to show that your spreading is for agricultural benefit or ecological improvement</li>
  <li>must not exceed the quantities of waste in your agreed deployment form</li>
  <li>comply with the limits in table 2.1</li>
  <li>must only spread the waste types listed in your permit</li>
</ul>

<p>To check the waste types associated with sewage sludge see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-codes-for-sewage-sludge-and-sludge-containing-other-materials-rps-231/waste-codes-for-sewage-sludge-and-sludge-containing-other-materials-rps-231">Waste codes for sewage sludge and sludge containing other materials: RPS 231</a>.</p>

<h4>SR2010 No 4: mobile plant for landspreading</h4>

<p>Under SR2010 No 4 you can spread the wastes listed in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>table 2.2A List A lower risk wastes</li>
  <li>table 2.2B List B higher risk wastes</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the different limits in Table 2.1 Activities for low risk and high risk wastes.</p>

<p>You must not use SR2010 No 4 for land restoration – use SR2010 No 5.</p>

<h4>SR2010 No 5: mobile plant for reclamation, restoration or land improvement</h4>

<p>SR2010 No 5 lists the wastes you can use in tables 2.2 and 2.3.</p>

<p>To operate under this permit you must confirm the intended land use of the site. For example, an agricultural or non-agricultural end use. You must not use the wastes in table 2.3 to treat land that you intend to return to agricultural use.</p>

<p>We class crops or grassland which are or could directly or indirectly link to the food chain as an agricultural activity. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conservation grassland grazed by sheep</li>
  <li>energy crops for anaerobic digestion where the digestate will be used for agricultural benefit on land</li>
  <li>energy crops or other non-food crops that can fit onto an agricultural rotation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you grow energy crops over a significant amount of time, we may class this as non-agricultural land. For example, short rotation coppice grown as a fuel for 15 years or more.</p>

<p>For SR2010 No 5 your deployment must be to restore, reclaim or improve the land. Once the land has been fully restored, if you want to deploy again for agricultural benefit or ecological improvement you must do this under SR2010 No 4, SR2010 No 6 or a bespoke permit.</p>

<h4>SR2010 No 6: mobile plant for landspreading of sewage sludge</h4>

<p>You can use SR2010 No 6 for spreading treated sludges from the treatment of urban waste water (waste code 19 08 05) on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-agricultural land</li>
  <li>agricultural land used to produce non-food crops that are not grown in short-term rotation with food crops</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need an environmental permit to landspread waste code 19 08 05 to agricultural land. You can do this under the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations. See also the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sewage-sludge-in-agriculture-code-of-practice">Sewage sludge in agriculture: code of practice</a>.</p>

<p>The Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations define agricultural land as ‘the growing of all types of commercial food crops, including for stock-rearing purposes’.</p>

<h4>Spreading activities</h4>

<p>When you spread the waste consider doing it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at a time when the soil or crop need it</li>
  <li>to provide optimal benefit to the soil or crop</li>
  <li>when the weather and ground conditions are suitable so that the soil can incorporate the waste and the crop can use it – you must also comply with 2.3.2 Adverse weather conditions for landspreading</li>
  <li>as accurately as possible to achieve the deployment application rate</li>
</ul>

<p>You must spread the waste at the rates in the agreed deployment form – this is to meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-produce-a-benefit-statement#section-2-waste-recovery-without-harm">waste recovery test 1</a> so that the minimum amount of waste is used to give the intended benefit.</p>

<p>Machinery used to spread wastes must be appropriate for the physical state of the waste and the receiving land. For example, to allow for slope, soil type and land use.</p>

<p>You should not spread liquid and odorous wastes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using high trajectory splash plate equipment – adjust this to a low trajectory spread no more than 4m from ground level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on steep slopes where there is a high risk of run-off</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you use liquid waste on bare soil or stubble without injecting into the soil, you should work it into the soil as soon as reasonably practicable and at the latest within 24 hours.</p>

<p>You can find further information on spreading in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protecting-our-water-soil-and-air">Protecting our water, soil and air</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to use waste containing animal by-products you must follow the general measures set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/landspreading-benefits-and-risks-of-the-waste-types-you-can-use/02-waste-codes">02 02 wastes from the preparation and processing of meat, fish and other foods of animal origin</a> in Landspreading: benefits and risks of the waste types you can use.</p>

<h4>Benefits and risks of different types of spreading techniques</h4>

<p>You will need to consider the benefits and risks from the spreading technique and explain these in the relevant sections of your benefit statement.</p>

<p>The technique must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>suit the waste stream, the receiving land and the current or future crop</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow the waste to be applied to the receiving land at the application rates you state in the benefit statement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimise the potential for pollution caused by over-application, poor spreading, run-off, ammonia volatilisation and nuisance from odour, noise and dust</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Read these examples to find out the benefits and risks of each technique.</p>

<h4>Rota spreaders, rear discharge spreaders or dual-purpose spreaders</h4>

<p>You can use these techniques for applying solid and semi-solid wastes to the surface.</p>

<p>A rear discharge spreader spreads the waste evenly.</p>

<p>The benefits and risks from ammonia loss vary. They can be low or moderate.</p>

<p>The ammonia loss is relative to the percentage of dry matter and percentage of total ammoniacal nitrogen in the material, and the time it takes to incorporate after spreading.</p>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>potential crop damage, for example from smothering</li>
  <li>offensive odour from generating dust</li>
  <li>pests and scavengers</li>
  <li>soil structural damage from for example, rutting or compaction if spread on the wrong soil conditions</li>
  <li>direct discharge into surface water if spread too close</li>
</ul>

<h4>Low trajectory irrigators or pulse jet irrigators</h4>

<p>You can use these techniques for applying liquid wastes to the surface.</p>

<p>The benefits and risks from ammonia loss vary. They can be low or moderate. The loss of ammonia is relative to the percentage of dry matter, the percentage of total ammoniacal nitrogen in the liquid waste, droplet size and soil infiltration rate.</p>

<p>Benefits can include that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allows for low application rates – of less than 50m<sup>3</sup>/ha</li>
  <li>can be used on established grassland</li>
  <li>can result in acceptable spreading accuracy, subject to good management and supervision</li>
</ul>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drainage to and pollution of groundwater and groundwater-dependant surface water when spread in unsuitable soil or weather conditions or through over-application for the conditions</li>
  <li>nitrate leaching to groundwater during winter months</li>
  <li>direct discharge into surface water if spread too close</li>
  <li>potential wind drift through a pulse irrigator in a moderate breeze or above</li>
</ul>

<p>The risk of run-off including through land drains where present, can be from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>poor supervision</li>
  <li>use on an inappropriate soil</li>
  <li>unsuitable weather conditions</li>
  <li>an equipment failure for example, where anti-pollution pressure and flow switches are not used or are broken</li>
</ul>

<h4>High rate irrigators or rain guns</h4>

<p>You can use these techniques to apply liquid waste to the surface.</p>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>moderate to high ammonia loss relative to the percentage of dry matter, the percentage of total ammoniacal nitrogen in the effluent waste and the soil infiltration rate</li>
  <li>generation of aerosol spray</li>
  <li>pollution to groundwater and groundwater-dependent surface water when the application rate exceeds the field capacity, or if the soil is cracked</li>
  <li>nitrates leaching to groundwater during winter months</li>
  <li>an increase in the risk of run-off through land drains where present, and spreading in unsuitable soil and weather conditions</li>
  <li>reduced spreading accuracy and ponding of the liquid waste</li>
  <li>direct discharge to surface water or through run-off where the application rate is greater than soil infiltration</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non-precision broadcast methods</h4>

<p>For surface application with non-precision broadcast methods, you can use a vacuum or a pumped tanker fitted with a splash plate or nozzle to apply liquid and slurry wastes to the surface.</p>

<p>A pumped tanker achieves improved spreading accuracy when fitted with a positive displacement pump. A vacuum tanker may reduce spreading accuracy.</p>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a major source of ammonia loss, particularly if the liquid waste is not incorporated immediately after application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the use of high trajectory aerosol spray (greater than 4m above ground level) – we consider this a higher risk relative to other spreading methods due to drift, ammonia loss, lower accuracy and ponding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>crop damage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nitrate leaching to groundwater during winter months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>run-off, including through land drains where present, and soil structural damage when spreading in unsuitable soil and weather conditions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Precision methods</h4>

<p>You can use band spreaders and trailing shoe spreaders to apply liquid and slurry wastes to the surface. We consider this a lower risk than non-precision methods.</p>

<p>Benefits can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low ammonia loss, subject to good soil infiltration</li>
  <li>the use of low application rates - of less than 50m<sup>3</sup>/ha</li>
  <li>that it is suitable for standing crops, such as arable and root using tramlines or rows, and on established grassland</li>
  <li>low risk of crop damage</li>
</ul>

<p>Higher specification band spreaders and trailing shoe spreaders can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>achieve improved spreading accuracy</li>
  <li>maximise nutrient use</li>
  <li>minimise nutrient loss</li>
</ul>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>nitrate leaching to groundwater during winter months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>run-off and soil structural damage where spreading is done in unsuitable soil and weather conditions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tramlines and rows between crops may form pathways for run-off (by acting as shallow ditches) - made worse if planted down a slope</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>simple band spreaders provide reduced accuracy across spread width, relative to other spreading methods</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Shallow injection</h4>

<p>You can use shallow injection 5 to 10cm below surface level to apply liquid and slurry wastes to the sub-surface.</p>

<p>Benefits can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a low (open slot) to very low (closed slot) ammonia loss, except when injected in very dry or stony soil where the waste is likely to break the surface</li>
  <li>the use of low application rates of less than 50m<sup>3</sup>/ha</li>
  <li>improved spreading accuracy in favourable soil conditions, maximising nutrient use and minimising nutrient loss</li>
  <li>reduced risk of odour</li>
</ul>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>crop damage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>emission of greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide and methane, where injected waste concentrates in and around the injection slit and where anaerobic conditions develop</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nitrate leaching to groundwater during winter months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high risk of run-off and drainage to land drains if injected down slope, and if applied in clay soils at or near to field capacity, even at low application rates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reduced spreading accuracy in wet clay soils, where horizontal movement between injection slots is restricted by smearing and sealing of the clay by the disc</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Deep injection</h4>

<p>You can use deep injection (greater than 15cm) to apply liquid and slurry wastes to the sub-surface.</p>

<p>We do not expect you to use deep injection on soil that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shallow</li>
  <li>overly stony or cracked for example, clay</li>
  <li>on soils at or near field capacity</li>
  <li>if the soil has not dried out</li>
  <li>on wet heavy soils such as clay soils</li>
</ul>

<p>This may cause damage to the soil and unacceptable nutrient loss through leaching and drainage of the waste. This is likely to cancel out any benefit your treatment gives the soil.</p>

<p>You must only use deep injection on soil that is sufficiently dry. This will enable the soil to loosen and fracture as the wing of the deep injector cuts through it. It will also allow high pressure (500 to 700 KPa) injected effluent (more than 100 m<sup>3</sup>/ha) to move horizontally and achieve an acceptable spread pattern. This method is not a good choice during the winter in all soils. Wait until the end of soil drainage when the soil is dry enough.</p>

<p>Benefits can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recognised risk management technique when applying <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr> to land</li>
  <li>reduced risk of odour</li>
</ul>

<p>Risks can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>significant damage to grassland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>emissions of greenhouse gas, such as nitrous oxide and methane, where injected waste concentrates in and around the injection slit and where anaerobic conditions develop</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high risk of waste draining beyond crop use and polluting groundwater or groundwater-dependant surface water from light soils at or near field capacity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>very high risk of run-off polluting surface waters, land drains, smear channels from heavy soils at, or near field capacity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high risk of run-off where soil is very dry and or cracked</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater during winter months due to poor spread pattern and very high application rate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soil structure damage in wet soils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soils smearing and sealing when used in wet soils at or near field capacity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wet soils at or near field capacity restrict horizontal movement. Soils such as clay have limited capacity to hold effluent against drainage. Risk of drainage is increased as the restricted horizontal movement causes an already very high application of effluent to concentrate around the wing. Clay soils can smear and seal as the wing passes through the soil.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 to 2.1.6</h4>

<p>Rules 2.1.2 to 2.1.6 relate to deployment.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 (a) 10 waste streams</h4>

<p>Each deployment form covers no more than 10 waste streams. If you want to spread more than 10 waste streams on the same area of land you must submit another deployment application including the supporting documents and another payment.</p>

<p>If the new deployment claims a nutrient benefit, the crop and soil must need that nutrient.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 (b) Extent of land</h4>

<p>For SR2010 No 4 and No 6, a ‘single continuously managed area of land’ means a single waste stream for a single crop on a single continuous parcel of land (a field) of up to 100 hectares. A single land occupier, such as the landowner or tenant must control this land.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> we refer to an ‘area of land’. This means the same as a ‘parcel of land’ (a field).</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>You need to assess any potential risks or negative impacts from landspreading a particular waste in your benefit statement.</p>

<h4>2.1.3 Use appropriate technical expertise to produce a benefit statement</h4>

<p>For your deployment application you must provide a benefit statement. An appropriate technical expert must produce it. It must show that the activity is waste recovery and provides agricultural benefit or ecological improvement. It must also address any potential risks from the activity and how these will be controlled.</p>

<p>For details see Section 1 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-produce-a-benefit-statement">Landspreading: produce a benefit statement</a>.</p>

<h4>2.1.4 Starting activities</h4>

<p>You must not start any activities until we have agreed your deployment in writing. This includes bringing waste to the site. Where a deployment has expired and you intend to apply for a new deployment, you must not accept any waste to the site until the new deployment has been approved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1.5 </span> Comply with your agreed deployment</h3>

<p>You must only do the activities in line with the agreed deployment form unless otherwise agreed in writing by us. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-form-lpd1-guidance#changes-you-can-make">changes you can make</a> in Landspreading: form <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> guidance.</p>

<h4>2.1.6 Records</h4>

<p>You must keep up-to-date records to show you have complied with rules 2.1.3, 2.1.4 and 2.1.5.</p>

<h4>2.1.7 Surface water and groundwater restrictions</h4>

<p>You must not store or spread waste within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10m of any water course</li>
  <li>a groundwater source protection zone 1</li>
  <li>50m of any well, spring or borehole used to supply water for human consumption including from a private water supply</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out more on groundwater source protection zone 1 see the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/groundwater-source-protection-zones-spzs">Groundwater source protection zones</a>. This provides instructions on how to find them.</p>

<p>To find out if there is a private water supply within 50m of your activity you may have to contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the local authority</li>
  <li>people living near to where you want to store or spread the waste</li>
</ul>

<p>To find information on the risk to private water supplies see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protect-groundwater-and-prevent-groundwater-pollution/protect-groundwater-and-prevent-groundwater-pollution#sensitive-groundwater-locations">sensitive groundwater locations</a>.</p>

<p>Field heaps on steeply sloping land must not be within 30m of surface water.</p>

<h4>2.1.8 High readily available nitrogen waste</h4>

<p>All landspreading activities must comply with the requirements set out in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rules-for-farmers-and-land-managers-to-prevent-water-pollution">Rules for farmers and land managers to prevent water pollution</a> – the farming rules for water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nitrate-vulnerable-zones">Nitrate vulnerable zones</a> rules, where applicable</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See 3.2.4 Storage of highly readily available nitrogen waste for how to prevent or limit the loss of ammonia.</p>

<h4>High readily available nitrogen waste in groundwater safeguard zones</h4>

<p>You must only store or spread high readily available nitrogen wastes within a groundwater safeguard zones for nitrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in periods outside of the nitrate vulnerable zone closed periods for spreading organic manure with high readily available nitrogen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at application rates of equal to or less than 50m<sup>3</sup>/ha, with a minimum 3 week gap between applications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to a maximum application rate of 250kg total nitrogen for any given hectare</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Waste acceptance</h3>

<p>The waste you receive must be suitable for direct use. No treatment is allowed under landspreading permits.</p>

<p>If it is not suitable, you need to speak to your waste producer. They may need to control potential emissions from the waste.  For example, by treating it at the site where it is produced to reduce odour potential. The treatment must be done under a relevant permit.</p>

<h4>Waste duty of care</h4>

<p>You must follow the waste duty of care. See how to do this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-duty-of-care-code-of-practice">Waste duty of care code of practice</a>.</p>

<h4>Waste acceptance</h4>

<p>Your permit lists the waste code and description for each waste type you are allowed to use.</p>

<p>The waste producer must code and describe the waste correctly. They must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-classification-technical-guidance">Waste classification technical guidance WM3</a> to work out the description and then use the List of Waste (<abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr>) code. The waste producer may also use regulatory position statement <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-codes-not-otherwise-specified-rps-241">Waste codes not otherwise specified: RPS 241</a>.</p>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amend the <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> code after the waste is transferred from the site where it is produced</li>
  <li>rely on the 6-digit waste code only – you must also have the description</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the waste descriptions in your permit are different and more prescriptive than those that the waste producer will use.</p>

<p>For example, the waste producer will use the following <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> codes and descriptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>01 01 02 Wastes from mineral non-metalliferous excavation</li>
  <li>01 04 08 Waste gravel and crushed rocks other than those mentioned in 01 04 07</li>
</ul>

<p>SR2010 No 4 is more prescriptive as to what type of waste is allowed – either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>01 01 02 Chalk only</li>
  <li>01 04 08 Chalk only</li>
</ul>

<p>We have narrowed the description but the <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> code remains the same.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/landspreading-benefits-and-risks-of-the-waste-types-you-can-use">Landspreading: benefits and risks of the waste types you can use</a> for further details of wastes you can accept and what descriptions you must use for your activity.</p>

<p>You must only accept the waste if it has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been classified and assessed</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> code that is listed in your permit</li>
</ul>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have waste acceptance procedures detailed in your management system</li>
  <li>keep records that demonstrate you comply with your waste acceptance procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>See more information in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deposit-for-recovery-operators-environmental-permits/waste-acceptance-procedures-for-deposit-for-recovery">Waste acceptance procedures for deposit for recovery</a>.</p>

<p>You cannot operate under your standard rules permit if you want to spread a waste type not listed in that permit. You must apply for a bespoke permit and demonstrate the waste can be suitably recovered to land without causing harm.</p>

<h4>Accepting hazardous waste</h4>

<p>If you produce, transport or receive hazardous waste you must comply with the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations.</p>

<p>To find out what the controls are see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/dispose-hazardous-waste">hazardous waste</a> guidance.</p>

<p>There are 2 hazardous wastes you can use if you hold a standard rules permit. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 13 12* Cement kiln dusts and by-pass dust only</li>
  <li>19 02 04* Cement kiln dust and by-pass dust from cement kilns conditioned with water only</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are planning to use these wastes you must see the relevant section of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/landspreading-benefits-and-risks-of-the-waste-types-you-can-use">Landspreading: benefits and risks of the waste types you can use</a>.</p>

<p>For all other hazardous wastes you will need to apply for a bespoke permit.</p>

<p>If a waste stream has a <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> code that is a ‘mirror hazardous’ or ‘mirror non-hazardous’ then you may need to provide evidence if the waste:</p>

<ul>
  <li>displays any hazardous properties</li>
  <li>has been correctly coded</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, you may need to do additional sampling, analysis and assessment of the waste.</p>

<p>To find information on waste classification and how to determine if a waste is hazardous see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-classify-different-types-of-waste">Classify different types of waste</a></p>

    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-classification-technical-guidance">Waste classification technical guidance: WM3</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can only mix hazardous wastes if you comply with the requirements for hazardous waste. You must also see Storage of mixed waste streams before you mix any waste together.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Operating techniques</h3>

<p>You must operate in line with your management system.</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Storage</h4>

<p>Your storage activities must not exceed the limits set out in table 2.1 in your permit.</p>

<p>You need to demonstrate in the benefit statement that the method of storage is appropriate and will be continually maintained.</p>

<h4>Storing stackable waste</h4>

<p>For stackable waste you can create a field heap.</p>

<p>A field heap must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>occupy as small a surface area as is practically required to support the heap and prevent it from collapsing</li>
  <li>not be located within 30m of surface water if the land is steeply sloping</li>
</ul>

<p>Steeply sloping means land sloping 12 degrees (1 in 5 or 20%) or greater.</p>

<p>A field heap must be at the place where the waste will be used. This can be in or on the edge of the field. It may also be in a farm building, yard area or silage clamp, and on a concrete pad or area of hard standing.</p>

<p>Consider if the stackable waste is open to the weather. If it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>locate temporary field heaps in areas of low permeability, if practical</li>
  <li>grade temporary field heaps to promote rainwater run-off rather than infiltration into and through the waste</li>
  <li>manage run-off or leachate which may be produced by the waste</li>
  <li>be aware that the field heaps may slump</li>
  <li>consider location of any residential property or workplace in relation to the field heap that might be affected by loss of amenity or dust and odour</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider also not storing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>odorous waste within 250m of a residential property or workplace</li>
  <li>on land that is likely to become waterlogged, frozen or snow covered</li>
  <li>on land likely to flood</li>
  <li>on steeply sloping ground where there is a risk of run-off</li>
  <li>in any single position, on bare soil, for more than 12 months in a row</li>
  <li>over land drains or land drained in the last 12 months</li>
</ul>

<h4>Storing non-stackable waste</h4>

<p>You must store all non-stackable waste in a secure container such as a mobile tanker, lagoon or permanent tank.  These can include permanent engineered structures and former slurry stores.</p>

<p>You must store all liquid waste in a secure container which includes lagoons, with secondary containment.  See rule 3.2.3.</p>

<p>You must not store non-stackable waste within 0.3m of the top of an open storage container or within 0.75m of the top of a lagoon.</p>

<p>The lagoon or container must have enough:</p>

<ul>
  <li>storage capacity so that the waste will not overflow</li>
  <li>extra capacity to allow for any rainfall or run-off</li>
</ul>

<h4>Assess the benefits and risks from different types of storage</h4>

<p>You must assess the benefits and risks from different types of storage. See 2.1.1 Benefits and risks of storing stackable waste and 2.1.1 Benefits and risks of storing non-stackable waste.</p>

<p>You can find further practical information on storage in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protecting-our-water-soil-and-air">Protecting our water, soil and air</a>.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Adverse weather conditions for landspreading</h4>

<p>You must not spread wastes on land that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been frozen for 12 hours or more, in the preceding 24 hours</li>
  <li>is waterlogged, frozen or covered in snow</li>
</ul>

<h4>Use a dynamic risk assessment</h4>

<p>Consider any changes that may affect the activities. You must always make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your operations will not cause harm to people, animals or the environment</li>
  <li>you do not breach the requirements of your permit and deployment by spreading inappropriately or in the wrong conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>You must continually assess the situation before you spread to land. Use a dynamic risk assessment to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify hazards and risks</li>
  <li>take action to eliminate or reduce risk</li>
  <li>monitor and review the situation</li>
</ul>

<p>Your management system must set out procedures for documenting a dynamic risk assessment.</p>

<p>If you are using a generic risk assessment you must use it with the dynamic risk assessment.</p>

<p>See the following examples of changing circumstances.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>It is dry when you begin spreading, but the rain forecasted is heavier than expected.</p>

<p>Action: Stop spreading to avoid the risk of run-off into land drains or nearby water courses.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Your waste has been stockpiled for several months. When you start to open the pile you identify a potential for odour.</p>

<p>Action: Stop your activities and assess the likelihood and probable source of the odour. Adjust your operations as appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Emissions and monitoring</h2>

<p>You must be able to comply with rules 3.1 to 3.4 to make sure your activities do not cause pollution or nuisance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Point source emissions to air, water or land</h3>

<p>Your permit and deployment only allow point source emissions to land providing the source is listed on your agreed deployment form. You must meet the agreed limits. These include the waste types and quantities and the application rates to the receiving land.</p>

<p>Your permit does not allow point source emissions to air or water courses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Emissions of substances not controlled by emission limits</h3>

<p>Emissions not controlled by emission limits can arise before, during and after landspreading the waste. For example, when your waste streams are delivered or stored. These emissions must not cause pollution. They can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pollute air, surface water or groundwater, land</li>
  <li>harm sensitive receptors</li>
  <li>cause a nuisance</li>
</ul>

<p>Landspreading activities can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create dust</li>
  <li>result in mud and litter</li>
  <li>attract pests and scavengers such as small animals, birds and flies</li>
  <li>result in leaks from containers, machinery and equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Emissions not controlled by emission limits does not include odour. See rule 3.3.</p>

<p>The waste producer must control potential emissions from the waste by using appropriate treatment measures on the site where the waste is produced.</p>

<p>You should address all potential emissions from a deployment site in your written management system and any risk assessment. You must consider the sources, pathways and receptors from each site, for example, land drains leading to water courses.</p>

<p>To comply with rule 3.2.1, we expect you to use appropriate measures or equivalent measures that meet the same objectives. Use these to prevent or where this is not practicable to minimise the risks. You will need to have appropriate measures in place to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce dust</li>
  <li>control pests and scavengers</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can show in any approved emissions management plan that you have prevented or minimised the risks we will not consider this as breaching rule 3.2.1.</p>

<p>To avoid pollution and nuisance you must follow <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-monitor-emissions-for-your-environmental-permit">Control and monitor emissions for your environmental permit</a>.</p>

<h4>Appropriate measures for reducing dust</h4>

<p>If you have identified dust as a potential issue, we expect you to use these appropriate measures or equivalent measures that meet the same objectives.</p>

<p>When storing dusty wastes we expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep stockpiles of waste as small as possible</li>
  <li>locate stockpiles in sheltered areas if possible and consider covering them</li>
</ul>

<p>When spreading or handling dusty wastes we expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unload and load the waste in a way that reduces how much dust is generated</li>
  <li>spread within suitable weather windows where possible, to reduce the potential for dust generation</li>
  <li>spread on stubbles or established grass, not on land being cultivated with a broken surface</li>
  <li>minimise traffic speeds to reduce the generation of dust</li>
  <li>put in place speed limits for machinery haul routes</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid spreading near:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headlands close to sensitive receptors when running on stubble or bare land</li>
  <li>residential properties where dust may cause a nuisance</li>
  <li>sensitive habitats where dust may be deposited</li>
</ul>

<p>For further suggested appropriate measures see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-monitor-emissions-for-your-environmental-permit#dust-mud-and-litter">dust, mud and litter</a> in the guidance Control and monitor emissions for your environmental permit.</p>

<h4>Appropriate measures for controlling pests and scavengers</h4>

<p>Identify if your waste stream is likely to attract scavengers, vermin or flies, for example, food wastes and wastes containing <abbr title="animal by-products">ABPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>We expect you to use these appropriate measures or equivalent measures that meet the same objectives, to control pests and scavengers. You may use other management system procedures and measures to achieve the same objectives. To prevent nuisance from pests and scavengers you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>minimise the amount of waste you store and how long you store it by getting a daily delivery of waste and clearing your stockpiles each day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>load and unload waste and store it, such as stockpiles and nurse tanks, as far from human and environmental receptors as practicable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use appropriate controls to manage flies in stockpiled wastes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep your machinery and equipment clean</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When spreading, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incorporate wastes into the soil within 24 hours of spreading where you are cultivating the land</li>
  <li>use injection spreading techniques when applying wastes to grassland or established crops</li>
  <li>complete your operations as quickly as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>For more guidance see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-monitor-emissions-for-your-environmental-permit#pest-management-plan">pest management plan</a> in the guidance Control and monitor emissions for your environmental permit.</p>

<h4>3.2.3 Secondary containment for liquid waste</h4>

<p>To comply with rule 3.2.3 all liquids in containers including lagoons must have secondary containment or other appropriate measures in place. This is to prevent, or where this is not practicable, to minimise any leaks or spills from the primary container.</p>

<p>We consider the appropriate measures for storing liquid wastes in fixed facilities to be those detailed in the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) (England) Regulations (as amended) (SSAFO).</p>

<p>Details of suitable designs and standards are set out in:</p>

<ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must also comply with rule 2.3.1 storage.</p>

<h4>3.2.4: storage of high readily available nitrogen wastes</h4>

<p>To comply with rule 3.2.4, you must prevent or limit the loss of ammonia from high readily available nitrogen waste. You must cover the waste if you are going to store it within 200m of a European Site, Ramsar site or Site of Special Scientific Interest.</p>

<p>You can use the Natural England <a class="govuk-link" href="http://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">designated sites system</a> to find out if you are near or within these receptors.</p>

<p>The cover must be of sufficient standard to prevent ammonia loss.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Odour</h3>

<p>You must make sure your activities do not cause odour pollution outside the deployment area. We will use our professional judgement to confirm if the odour is at a level likely to cause pollution.</p>

<p>Find more information in the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-monitor-emissions-for-your-environmental-permit#odour">Control and monitor emissions for your environmental permit: odour</a>.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prepare, maintain and implement a written odour management plan</li>
  <li>make this available for us to inspect if we ask</li>
  <li>use appropriate measures to prevent odour pollution and to reduce aerosol spray drift</li>
  <li>include any other actions you will take to prevent odour pollution</li>
  <li>identify the sensitive receptors and the risk to those receptors</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the wastes you are using are likely to be odorous, you must have a site specific odour management plan that is specific to the deployment.</p>

<p>You can use the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permitting-h4-odour-management">H4 odour management</a> to help you decide what to include in your plan. Where it is not possible to prevent odour pollution outside of the deployment area, you must be able to show how you have tried to minimise the odour.</p>

<p>If we get complaints of odour from outside of the deployment area, then we may ask you to provide a revised odour management plan. We will need to approve it and you must comply with the revised requirements.</p>

<h4>Appropriate measures to prevent odour pollution outside the deployment area</h4>

<p>We expect you to use these appropriate measures or equivalent measures that meet the same objectives, to prevent odour pollution outside the deployment area.</p>

<p>We expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take wind direction into account when spreading</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check if any sensitive receptors such as residential properties, workplaces, or public rights of way are downwind of where you will spread</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>locate your stockpiles where the prevailing wind direction has the least effect on sensitive receptors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider when you spread the waste – for example, avoid bank holidays and weekends when odour may cause nuisance to more people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cover your stockpiles or use covered or enclosed storage facilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimise the amount you store – for example, receive daily deliveries during the days you are spreading to ensure the tank is empty at the end of each working day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incorporate the waste into the soil within 24 hours of spreading</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do olfactory monitoring for odour throughout the working day</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Other actions to prevent odour pollution</h4>

<p>Where you know a particular waste stream has odour issues, consider pre-treatment before field delivery. Note that you cannot do this treatment under your mobile plant permit.</p>

<p>When you spread odorous wastes you can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider fitting spreading activities around wind and weather conditions</li>
  <li>avoid using high trajectory spreading techniques</li>
  <li>inject liquid wastes – this can also be beneficial as it increases nutrient availability and uptake</li>
</ul>

<p>For standing crops, apply to the bottom of the rows with a dribble bar or other suitable landspreading machinery.</p>

<h4>Appropriate measures to control odour from aerosol spray drift</h4>

<p>Aerosols of fine droplets can cause odour nuisance, especially when you are spreading liquid wastes. Where you cannot control this odour, describe the actions you will take to prevent nuisance to sensitive receptors in your odour management plan.</p>

<p>We expect you to use these appropriate measures or equivalent measures that meet the same objectives, to control odour from aerosol spray drift.</p>

<p>To reduce the potential for odour from aerosol spray drift we expect you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>operate in suitable weather</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimise aerosols from your spreading machinery, such as reducing discharge pressures when operating splash plate spreading machines</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoid spreading wastes close to residential properties – consider for example, wind direction, time of day, using low emission spreading equipment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoid spreading wastes near other sensitive habitats to reduce nutrient deposits or pollution</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Noise and vibration</h3>

<p>Your activities must not cause noise or vibration pollution outside the deployment area. Noise or vibration should not be above that of normal agricultural activities. You will need to consider the risk of noise and vibration in your deployment application and further consider it in your management system.</p>

<p>If we get a complaint of noise or vibration from outside of the deployment area, we may investigate this further. We will use our professional judgement to confirm if the noise or vibration are at levels likely to cause pollution outside the deployment area. We may ask you to submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-and-monitor-emissions-for-your-environmental-permit#noise-and-vibration-management-plan">noise and vibration management plan</a>. We will need to approve it and you must comply with the revised requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Information</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Records</h3>

<p>Rules 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 requires the following.</p>

<p>You must keep records that demonstrate how you have complied with your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>permit and deployment form</li>
  <li>management system</li>
  <li>any other plans or requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>If you change any of these documents you must mark up what they are. You must use version control and not overwrite records. You must follow the guidance under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-apply-to-deploy-mobile-plant/landspreading-form-lpd1-guidance#changes-you-can-make">changes you can make</a> in the Landspreading: form <abbr title="Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment">LPD1</abbr> guidance.</p>

<p>We must be able to read your records. You must make them available to us on request.</p>

<p>Your records must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your deployment form</li>
  <li>the location map, benefit statement, waste and receiving soil analyses</li>
  <li>the site specific risk assessment, if applicable</li>
  <li>waste duty of care records such as waste transfer notes for non-hazardous waste</li>
  <li>consignment notes for hazardous waste</li>
  <li>information showing how you have complied with your benefit statement</li>
  <li>any incidents that occurred</li>
  <li>quarterly waste returns</li>
  <li>your technically competent manager and nominated competent person attendance</li>
  <li>any non-compliance, discussions with us, and any action you took</li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep these records for 6 years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Reporting</h3>

<p>Operators that hold mobile plant permits must complete quarterly waste returns. If you do not spread waste in a quarter, you must still send us a nil return.</p>

<p>We recommend submitting your details online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gor-online-system-spreadsheet">generic operator returns (GOR) returns online spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot submit your returns online, you can email it using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-returns-email-spreadsheet">waste returns email spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h4>How to complete a quarterly waste return for a mobile plant permit</h4>

<p>Recording mobile plant permit information is different to that for fixed location waste activities.</p>

<p>Each quarter we need to know the total quantity of each waste type received and where it was spread.</p>

<p>In the ‘waste_received worksheet’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the ‘origin’ to show the local authority area where the waste was spread – not where the waste came from</li>
  <li>select the <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> code</li>
  <li>tell us the quantity of waste received</li>
</ul>

<p>Tell us the quantity of the waste you rejected and why – for example, it was not of good enough quality to spread to land.</p>

<p>In the ‘waste_removed worksheet’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select the destination of the waste rejected – this is the local authority area to where the waste was moved to for disposal or for recovery elsewhere</li>
  <li>select the <abbr title="List of Waste">LoW</abbr> code</li>
  <li>tell us the quantity of waste removed</li>
</ul>

<p>For further details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-operator-waste-returns">how to complete waste or materials facility returns and deadlines for submission</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Notifications</h3>

<p>Your permit states that you must notify us ’without delay’ if you are likely to breach rules 4.3.1 (a), (b) and (c).</p>

<p>‘Without delay’ means you must notify us as soon as is practicable, for example, contact by telephone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your site officer or local Environment Agency office</li>
  <li>the 24-hour <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-an-environmental-incident">Environment Agency pollution incident hotline</a>, 0800 80 70 60</li>
</ul>

<p>To meet rule 4.3.2, within 24 hours, you must confirm in writing any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actual or potential pollution incidents</li>
  <li>breaches of emission limits</li>
</ul>

<p>To meet rule 4.3.4, each time you want to begin landspreading you must tell us at least 48 hours (but no more than 7 days) before the date you start. If your spreading activities have to stop for more than 7 days, you must tell us again when you will restart spreading using the same timescales.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Interpretation</h3>

<p>Your mobile plant permit lists the expressions used in your permit and gives their meanings.</p>
