<h2>

<h2>

We will also share information under GDPR Sch 2 Prt 2 Para 5 (2) of GDPR where disclosures are required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>10.2</strong> We may also share information where you provide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consent-privacy-policy">consent</a> for DBS to do so.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Storage of data</h2>

<p><strong>11.1</strong> Your data, once received, is held in secure paper and computer files with restricted access. We have approved measures in place to stop unlawful access and disclosure. All of our IT systems are subject to formal accreditation inline with HMG policy. They also align with the security required within GDPR to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Retention of data</h2>

<p><strong>12.1</strong> We operate a Data Retention Policy to ensure that information is not held for longer than necessary. For general enquiries where we do not have a DBS check application or barring referral, your information will be retained for three months.</p>

<p>However if your enquiry is relevant to a DBS check application, DBS certificate or barring referral, it will be held on the original system or within clerical files for the time determined in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-data-retention-policy">Data Retention Policy</a>, relevant to DBS check applications and barring referrals.</p>

<p><strong>12.2</strong> The Home Office has placed a restriction on the destruction of information due to the ongoing Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA). To comply with DBS’ Data Retention Policy and the restriction, DBS have agreed with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) to mark relevant information i.e. information identified as not relevant for ongoing DBS purposes, for secure destruction and place this information outside of operational control. It will only be supplied to IICSA following a legal request.</p>

<p><strong>12.3</strong> At the conclusion of IICSA and/or lifting of the restriction by Home Office this information will be securely destroyed as soon as is practicable.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Your rights and how we protect them</h2>
