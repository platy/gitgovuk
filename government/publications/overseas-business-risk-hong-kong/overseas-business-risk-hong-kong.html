<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Economics and Trade</h2>
<p>Hong Kong continues to be a major trade and investment partner for the UK. Hundreds of British companies have operated in Hong Kong for many decades, reflecting the historical ties. British companies continue to choose Hong Kong for a variety of reasons. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absence of capital controls</li>
  <li>A currency pegged to the US dollar</li>
  <li>A Common Law legal system based on English law which provides effective dispute resolution systems in commercial cases to international standards</li>
  <li>The ease of setting up a business</li>
  <li>A free port with no tariffs for goods on entry</li>
  <li>A low-tax regime</li>
  <li>Access to finance as a global financial centre</li>
  <li>Strong connectivity to China and to the rest of the Asia Pacific region</li>
</ul>

<p>Hong Kong’s political landscape has changed significantly since the protests in 2019 and the imposition of the National Security Law on 30 June 2020. Political rights and freedoms in Hong Kong have been significantly eroded, especially freedom of expression and the right to assembly. However, most businesses report that they are able to operate normally amidst the current political environment. For further comment on this, please see section 3 (Business and Human Rights) below.</p>

<p>British businesses operating in Hong Kong, or thinking of establishing there, should familiarise themselves with the changes to the political, social and business environments and seek appropriate professional advice where needed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Trade and Investment Overview</h3>

<p>Hong Kong is</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK’s second largest market for goods in Asia-Pacific (after mainland China ), and 11th largest worldwide</li>
  <li>a large export and import market for the UK, £12.3 billion of goods and services were exported to Hong Kong in 2021, and £10.7 billion imported</li>
  <li>the destination for 4.6% of the UK’s outward FDI stock in 2020, or £76.0 billion</li>
  <li>the test-bed for the internationalisation of China’s currency, the renminbi (RMB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cooperation through the London-Hong Kong Financial Services Forum has helped establish London’s status as an offshore hub for RMB trading.</p>

<p>As a customs territory, Hong Kong is responsible for its own bilateral and multilateral economic and trade relations. Hong Kong has been a strong advocate for free trade and open markets in fora such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), where it has taken part separately from China. In other multilateral fora, such as the G20, Hong Kong participates as part of the Chinese delegation. Hong Kong is currently seeking accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership which would further boost economic integration in the region.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Economic Overview</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is an open economy based on four key pillars – financial services, tourism, trading and logistics, and professional services. As a regional hub, Hong Kong has historically attracted global visitors for both tourism and business purposes. Pre-pandemic, tourist visitors reached 56 million (2019). However, retail and tourism related sectors have been impacted hard by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Following contraction in 2020, Hong Kong’s economy returned to growth in 2021 when GDP grew 6.4%. Predicted growth in 2022 is weaker at around 1.2% due to uncertainties over the impact of Covid on the territory. Unemployment levels in 2022 are below 4%. Hong Kong’s competitiveness faces some medium-term risks. Some members of the business community consider capacity to innovate and limited urban space to be amongst the main challenges facing Hong Kong’s business environment.</p>

<p>The IMD World Competitiveness 2021 rankings place Hong Kong as the seventh best place to do business worldwide, down from 1st in 2017. In January 2022 the Global Financial Centres Index ranked Hong Kong as third globally behind London and New York. The World Economic Forum has paused its Global Competitiveness Index rankings. As of 2019, Hong Kong was ranked 3rd globally.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Economic integration with the Mainland</h3>

<p>The economies of Hong Kong and mainland China are increasingly integrated. The Hong Kong/Mainland China Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) was signed in 2003. Under CEPA, Hong Kong companies (including UK companies with substantive business operations in Hong Kong for 3-5 years) get preferential access into the mainland market. On trade in goods, the arrangement allows tariff free imports of all goods of Hong Kong origin into China. A new agreement on trade in services was signed in November 2015, allowing Hong Kong service providers unrivalled access to the Chinese market. CEPA was further enhanced for cross-boundary investments in June 2017. The development of the Greater Bay Area initiative, launched in February 2019 (covering nine cities in Guangdong province plus Hong Kong and Macao) could provide deeper economic integration and business opportunities as it develops.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect pilot scheme was launched in 2014 and allows international investors to invest in mainland China’s A-share market and Chinese investors to invest in Hong Kong. In August 2016, the aggregate quota of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was lifted to deepen financial linkages with the mainland. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched in December 2016. The operation of this scheme mirrors its Shanghai-Hong Kong counterpart. In addition to the Stock Connect, a ‘China-Hong Kong Bond Connect’ was launched northbound in July 2017, allowing international investors to gain access to the mainland bond market via Hong Kong accounts. Currently two-thirds of international investors’ mainland stock holdings are through stock connects, and over half of their turnover in onshore bonds is traded through the bond connect.</p>

<p>In September 2021 a Wealth Management Connect scheme was launched to facilitate greater cross-border investments between Hong Kong and Guangdong cities in mainland China. As of December 2021 nineteen Hong Kong banks launched eligible services with mainland partner banks, 22,000 investors had opened accounts, and there had been 5000 cross-boundary remittances totalling more than RMB400 million.</p>

<p>Plans for further financial integration schemes between Hong Kong and the rest of the Greater Bay Area such as ‘Insurance Connect’ would likely create further opportunities for businesses by allowing them to access a wider market.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Approach to COVID-19</h3>

<p>The Hong Kong Government has a policy of “dynamic zero COVID” which aims to keep Covid out of the territory and cases to a minimum. The Government’s primary goal is to be able to reopen its border with mainland China. This continues in 2022 to result in strict social distancing measures, restrictions on the operations of businesses, quarantine on arrival, international border restrictions and isolation of cases and contact tracing and isolation. Such measures will continue to drag on the local economy and have made it difficult for some firms to retain staff.

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Government</h2>

<p>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (SAR) covers an area of 1,098 square kilometres (424 square miles) on the southern coast of China. It comprises Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories, and about 235 outlying islands.</p>

<p>Hong Kong falls under the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China, which is responsible for its foreign affairs and defence. However, Hong Kong operates under the “One Country, Two Systems” model. The Sino-British Joint Declaration, (the agreement that returned sovereignty of Hong Kong from the UK to China), provides for Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree of autonomy in the other areas of its governance, including economic and trade affairs. Hong Kong’s Basic Law encompasses the key features of the Joint Declaration, such as Hong Kong’s special status, high degree of autonomy, the continuation of its capitalist system, common law legal system, and rights and freedoms. It prescribes, among other things, the relationship between the Chinese Government and the Hong Kong SAR Government, the fundamental rights and duties of the Hong Kong people and the SAR’s political structure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Political Structure</h3>

<p>The Chief Executive is chosen by a 1461 member Election Committee. In May, John Lee, previously Chief Secretary, was elected uncontested for a five-year term as the next Chief Executive, securing 99% of the votes. He will take office on 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>The Legislative Council (LegCo) is Hong Kong’s legislature. Legislative elections took place on 19 December 2021 subject to the overhaul of Hong Kong’s electoral system imposed by China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) in March 2021.</p>

<p>The Legislative Council was expanded from 70 to 90 seats with only 20 directly elected by popular vote. Under the changes, all candidates must pass National Security vetting and secure nomination from the 1461 member Election Committee, which itself then elects 40 members to sit in the Legislative Council. The 2021 Legislative Council election resulted in a record low voter turnout of 30.2% to elect the 20 directly elected seats.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong SAR Government is led by the Chief Executive. The principal officials are the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Financial Secretary and the Secretary for Justice. Cabinet positions are not elected, but are political appointees made by the Chief Executive. This is also the case for the Executive Council, the Government’s advisory body.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Business and Human Rights</h2>

<p>There are concerns about the impact of the wider political environment on businesses operating in Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s political environment remains divided between those that support democracy and those that support closer ties with mainland China. From June 2019, Hong Kong experienced roughly six-months of protests and civil unrest, and calls for greater democracy.</p>

<p>Some businesses have faced pressure to take public positions on political developments - usually either to support or renounce the Chinese Government’s stance towards Hong Kong. Protests in 2019 saw boycotts and disruption to a number of businesses, including vandalism.</p>

<p>On 30 June 2020, the Chinese authorities imposed a National Security Law (NSL) on Hong Kong, with the stated aim to restore stability to the region. Some businesses have argued that the National Security Law has brought a welcome degree of stability, but civil society have expressed concern about the impact of the law on Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Sino-British Joint Declaration</h3>

<p>The Foreign Secretary <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/six-monthly-reports-on-hong-kong">reports to Parliament</a> every six months on developments in Hong Kong, with a particular focus on Hong Kong’s social and economic systems, lifestyle, and rights and freedoms, as guaranteed under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p>

<p>Following three successive breaches of the Joint Declaration between June 2020 and March 2021, the UK now considers Beijing to be in a state of ongoing non-compliance with the Joint Declaration.</p>

<p>Those breaches were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The imposition of the National Security Law on Hong Kong on 30 June 2020.</li>
  <li>The creation of new rules to disqualify Hong Kong’s elected legislators on 11 November 2020, which resulted in the disqualification of four democratic lawmakers, and the mass resignation of most of the remaining pan-democratic legislators from the Legislative Council.</li>
  <li>The overhaul of Hong Kong’s election system by China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) on 11 March 2021.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Rights and freedoms</h3>

<p>The National Security Law (NSL) has affected the extent to which the people of Hong Kong are able to exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms. It has damaged freedom of expression in academia, schools and libraries, including through the removal of textbooks and other books containing certain political content. Uncertainties about how the provisions in the law might continue to be used and expanded are having a wider chilling effect on the exercise of freedoms and encouraging self-censorship. Pressure on pro-democracy legislators and activists has increased, with a large number arrested under the NSL and other charges.</p>

<p>There have been increasing concerns about freedom of speech. Individuals have been prosecuted for using certain words and slogans, mostly relating to Hong Kong independence or foreign sanctions. The restrictions on free speech have in turn affected media freedom, with increasing censorship of what media outlets can publish on sensitive political topics.  Under the NSL, incorporated or unincorporated bodies can be fined and their operation suspended or licence/permit revoked. The NSL has resulted in increased self-censorship including voluntary closure of media outlets. The NSL has extra-territorial effects and covers offences outside of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The UK Government responded to the introduction of the NSL with a series of measures including: the immediate and indefinite suspension of the UK’s Extradition Treaty with Hong Kong, extending the UK arms embargo on mainland China to cover Hong Kong, and creating a new, bespoke immigration route for British Nationals (Overseas) and their dependents.</p>

<p>Hong Kong law provides for an independent judiciary. Courts can, and do, find against the government. However, the NSL grants the police increased powers to search premises, freeze assets and to access information in cases related to national security. It also allows for trials without jury and behind closed doors, and permits the mainland criminal code to be applied in certain circumstances, including removing a suspect to face trial in the mainland. There continue to be arrests and trials of pro-democracy politicians and activists.</p>

<p>Since 1997 UK serving judges have sat on Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal. On 30 March 2022, the President of the UK’s Supreme Court, Lord Reed, alongside the serving UK Supreme Court Judge, Lord Hodge, resigned from Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal. Lord Reed noted that, “Hong Kong’s courts continue to be internationally respected for their commitment to the rule of law” but that he could not continue to sit “without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression.”</p>

<p>Hong Kong law, including related regulations and statutory instruments, protects the right of workers to form and join independent unions without previous authorisation or excessive requirements, and conduct legal strikes. However, the law does not provide for the right to collective bargaining. Trade unions must register with the government’s Registry of Trade Unions and must have a minimum membership of seven persons for registration. Unions can affiliate, and workers are not prevented from unionising. However, the Hong Kong Government has recently stressed the need for all trade unions to remain apolitical. In August 2021, the Professional Teachers Union, the largest teachers’ union in Hong Kong, disbanded following the Hong Kong Government’s decision to officially cut ties with the union on the basis that it was politically active. Hong Kong’s second largest trade union, the “Confederation of Trade Unions” also disbanded on 3 October 2021.</p>

<p>Hong Kong law provides for freedom of assembly and association, but protests are subject to police authorisation. Many recently have been turned down, notionally on Covid-19 grounds. Government social distancing regulations have restricted the amount of people allowed to gather publicly. Freedom of religion is broadly respected, and a number of religions are able to coexist without difficultly in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet. However, on 16 January 2021, Hong Kong Internet Service Providers took down a pro-democracy website. This followed an order from the Hong Kong authorities, citing national security grounds, and was the first occurrence of its kind. Concerns have been raised by social media companies about proposed legislation targeting the publication of personal information (doxxing).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Sanctions</h3>

<p>On 14 July 2020, the US Congress enacted The Hong Kong Autonomy Act (HKAA). The bill imposes sanctions on foreign individuals and entities that materially contribute to China’s failure to preserve Hong Kong’s autonomy. On the same day, the US President issued Executive Order 13936 on “Hong Kong Normalization”. The Executive Order determined that the Hong Kong SAR was no longer sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to the People’s Republic of China under US law and provided for the imposition of sanctions.</p>

<p>The US has since imposed sanctions on a number of individuals in Hong Kong and mainland China linked with undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy, rights and freedoms. Under the HKAA, the US State Department and Treasury monitor whether any foreign financial institutions have knowingly conducted significant financial transactions with the designated individuals.</p>

<p>On 26 March 2021, China sanctioned a number of UK individuals and entities in response to the sanctions imposed by the EU and UK in relation to Xinjiang, prohibiting them from entering the Mainland, Hong Kong and Macao, freezing their property in China, and prohibiting Chinese citizens and institutions from doing business with them.</p>

<p>In June 2021, the NPCSC promulgated the “Counter Foreign Sanctions Law of the People’s Republic of China” (CFSL). This law provides the legal basis for China’s further action and counter measures against sanctions imposed by other countries. The NPCSC session in August 2021 concluded without announcing whether or not it had decided to annex further national laws to Hong Kong’s Basic Law as its pre-published agenda had stated. There had been speculation that this could include the CFSL.</p>

<p>If you have queries relating to sanctions compliance, you should consult relevant national guidance and legislation. You may also wish to take legal advice as appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>Intellectual Property (IP) rights are territorial, that is they only give protection in jurisdictions where they are granted or registered. If you are thinking about trading internationally, then you should consider registering your IP rights in your export markets. Specific advice should be sought from qualified professionals either in the UK or overseas.</p>

<p>Hong Kong has a separate IP system to mainland China. The Hong Kong IP legal framework is comprehensive and generally considered to be one of the most effective in Asia. Hong Kong is ranked 16th globally in the 2021 International Property Rights Index (the UK is ranked 15th).</p>

<p>Hong Kong is a signatory to several international conventions on IP. Its legislative and administrative regime for IP rights is generally compliant with the World Trade Organisation agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Intellectual Property Department (IPD) is the government department responsible for registration of trade marks, patents and designs, and for overseeing copyright policy. IPD also provides policy advice to the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development on policies and legislation to protect IP in Hong Kong, as well as public outreach activity. Hong Kong Customs and Excise are the primary agency responsible for criminal enforcement against IP infringement. Any copyright and trademark right owners who find their rights being infringed are advised by IPD to contact the Customs and Excise Department. The Hong Kong court system operates according to common law principles and both interim and permanent injunctions can be obtained in IP cases. Hong Kong has no specialist IP court.</p>

<p>UK companies based in or planning to export to Hong Kong are advised to register their IP in Hong Kong and any other jurisdictions where they may want to expand their products and services in the future. Some companies also report that they have been the victim of ‘brand squatting’. This is when companies or individuals pre-emptively register a trade mark or company name, intending to negotiate a payment to transfer the rights, and/or to piggy-back on the reputation of international brands. This practice has been particularly prevalent with entities from mainland China, so companies active in Hong Kong should also consider trade mark registration on the mainland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Bribery and Corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>For more information, read the information provided on our&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/anti-bribery-policy">bribery and corruption page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>The UK Bribery Act</h3>

<p>The Bribery Act applies to non-UK companies operating in the United Kingdom and to UK companies working overseas. It created four prime offences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two general offences covering the offering, promising or giving of an advantage, and requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting of an advantage;</li>
  <li>An offence of bribing a foreign public official; and</li>
  <li>A new offence of failure by a commercial organisation to prevent a bribe being paid to obtain or retain business or a business advantage (should an offence be committed, it will be a defence that the organisation has adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Act recognises that no bribery prevention regime will be capable of preventing bribery at all times. A company will have a full defence if it can show that despite a particular case of bribery it nevertheless had adequate procedures in place to prevent persons associated with it from bribing. Companies must therefore make sure that they have strong, up-to-date and effective anti-bribery policies and systems in place to prevent bribery by persons associated with them.</p>

<span class="number">5.2 </span>Bribery and Corruption in Hong Kong</h3>

<p>In Hong Kong there is zero tolerance for bribery.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap201" rel="external">The Prevention of Bribery Ordinance</a>&nbsp;criminalises bribery and corrupt transactions in both the public and private sectors.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.icac.org.hk/en/home/index.html" rel="external">Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC)</a>&nbsp;is the government agency which investigates and prosecutes corruption in the public and private sectors in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Hong Kong was ranked 12th (of 180) in&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2019" rel="external">Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)</a> for 2021, reflecting its robust structure of checks and balances (the UK was ranked 11th).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Organised Crime</h2>

<p>The Hong Kong SAR government takes a serious view of organised crime and has in place severe measures to counter it, including large fines and long sentences for drug and firearms trafficking, money laundering and human and goods trafficking. The Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance empowers the Hong Kong’s law enforcement agencies (Hong Kong Police Force, Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department and the Independent Commission Against Corruption) to investigate serious and organised crimes. Uniquely, the Hong Kong Police has specific responsibility for investigating triad-related offences and has dedicated units to take proactive action against triads. While you should be vigilant against triad-related activity, there is no evidence to suggest this is a growing problem.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Fraud and money laundering</h3>

<p>Hong Kong is often seen as an attractive option for money laundering, due to the nature of its financial structure. The money laundering regulations are enforced by the financial investigation bureaus of both the Hong Kong Police Force and Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department. Frauds and scams are ever-evolving, but the emergence of so-called “CEO scams” and email scams has identified vulnerabilities for companies across the globe, including those in Hong Kong. Further information on these and other types of fraud can be obtained via the City of London Police and Action Fraud websites.</p>

<p>2020 saw a large rise in COVID-19 linked frauds ranging from masks, gowns and hand sanitisers to “Covid cures”. These have targeted Hong Kong residents and businesses. It has also seen local crime groups targeting other countries and jurisdictions. As a global financial centre, Hong Kong remains a target for illicit and licit finance.</p>

<p>During 2021 there has been a noticeable increase in crime groups utilising Phishing SMS scams where Hong Kong based customers receive, on the face of it, SMS messages from large, reputable financial institutions. The instructions and links within the SMS’s subsequently result in customers providing enough details to allow the crime groups to compromise the bank accounts and steal funds. These funds are then quickly transferred overseas.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong SAR Government has restrictions in place on the quantity of powdered baby formula allowed for persons departing the territory. Penalties for non-compliance are severe.
