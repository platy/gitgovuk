<h2>
<abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O: Summary of further modelling of easing restrictions – Roadmap Step 4</h2>

<p>Date: 9 June 2021</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>1. All modelling of taking Step 4 of the Roadmap on 21 June 2021 shows a large resurgence in infections and admissions. The scale of this resurgence is highly uncertain, and it could be either considerably smaller or larger than previous waves.</p>

<p>2. The key uncertainties are the growth advantage of B.1.617.2<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> (henceforth referred to as delta) compared to B.1.1.71 (henceforth referred to as alpha), effectiveness of vaccines against severe disease caused by the delta variant, and the extent to which behaviours and therefore transmission will change after Step 4.</p>

<p>3. In all scenarios modelled, even a short delay to the timing to Step 4 results in a significant drop in the number of people being admitted to hospital as more people are vaccinated and as the school summer holidays get closer. Even a two-week delay would have a significant effect, but a four-week delay is modelled as reducing the peak in hospital admissions by around a third to a half. A delay would also allow evidence to build up on the effectiveness of vaccines against delta, potentially increasing precision in future modelling scenarios.</p>

<p>4. Since the start of April 2021, the ratio of confirmed cases to admissions has been stable. If this continues, each doubling of cases will lead to a doubling of admissions. The number of hospital admissions that are S-gene positive (and are therefore almost certainly the delta variant) has been growing in recent weeks, however, this has been masked by a drop in those which are S-gene negative.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is estimated to be 40 to 80 per cent higher for delta than for alpha, although a figure higher or lower than this cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>6. <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O’s best estimate for <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> in England is between 1.2 and 1.4 and reflects the epidemiological situation approximately two weeks ago. This is substantially higher than the estimate of 1.0 to 1.1<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, which reflected the state of the epidemic shortly before Step 3 of the Roadmap was taken.</p>

<h3>Key changes since the paper of 5 May 2021:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Models now include the delta variant, which has been seeded and become dominant in England over the past month. It is estimated that <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is 40-80 per cent higher for delta than for alpha.</li>
  <li>Evidence from Public Health England and Public Health Scotland on vaccine effectiveness against the delta variant has been incorporated. This means assumptions on vaccine-induced protection are considerably less optimistic. Preliminary estimates of a higher rate of hospitalisation of cases for the delta variant compared with the alpha variant have <strong>not</strong> been included in these analyses, but are considered as part of sensitivity analysis in the accompanying <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> paper.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key assumptions in the central scenarios</h3>

<p>These are for the central scenarios and relate to the delta variant. Other assumptions, including for sensitivity analyses are given in Appendix 1.</p>

<p>A full set of assumptions is given in Appendix 1 and the respective modelling papers.</p>

<h3>Growth advantage of the delta variant</h3>
<p>7. Five <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O groups have continued to independently estimate the growth advantage of delta over alpha. The most recent estimates are that <strong><abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is 40 to 80 per cent higher for delta, although a figure higher or lower than this cannot be ruled out.</strong> These estimates would change if it were to become clear that the generation time (the time between primary and secondary infections) for delta is different from that of alpha.</p>

<h3>How the delta variant could result in a large surge in admissions</h3>

<p>8. At present, the number of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> hospital admissions remains low. They are expected, however, to rapidly increase:</p>

<p>a. Cases of delta have been doubling in the most recent weeks. This has been masked by a gradual decline in the prevalence of alpha but, as delta has come to dominate, it is now clear in the overall numbers. There is evidence of exponential growth in the epidemic in England in every age group.</p>

<p>b. This exponential growth in cases will accelerate as people have more social contact (including more riskier contacts), particularly if Step 4 is taken on 21 June 2021. This increase will continue to quicken until either a) behaviours spontaneously change in response to the resurgence, b) policy changes or c) a build-up in immunity (acquired either through vaccination or by infection) means the epidemic starts to grow more slowly and eventually shrink.</p>

<p>c. The delta variant is highly transmissible. Whilst the precise herd immunity threshold cannot be calculated, an R0 of 7 would require over 80 per cent of all people (not just adults) to be immune for herd immunity to be reached and for the epidemic to begin to shrink without further measures. Younger adults play a disproportionately large role in transmission but have not yet been vaccinated.</p>

<p>d. Whilst highly effective, vaccines do not provide perfect protection against infection and so more than 80 per cent of the population need to be either vaccinated or infected to prevent ongoing long chains of transmission. Despite the success of the vaccine rollout, without behavioural change, the growth in cases will increase for many more weeks.</p>

<p>e. The relationship between cases and hospitalisations has changed, however, it is not entirely broken. The ratio of confirmed cases to hospital admissions has been roughly stable since the start of April 2021 (Figure 1). This implies that a rapid increase in cases will lead to a rapid increase in admissions. Once the epidemic has settled to a new stable age distribution a doubling of cases will be expected to result in a doubling of admissions.</p>

The ratio of hospital admissions to cases is roughly stable from April onwards." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/125410/spimstep41.png"></div></figure>

<p>f. Hospitalisation numbers are currently very low. As with cases two to three weeks ago, however, there has been a rapid increase in admissions with S-gene positive variants (almost certainly the delta variant). This has been masked by a decline in S-gene negative variants (Figure 2).</p>

Analysis by <abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Council">JBC</abbr> using data from <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Digital.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>g. The last 18 months have demonstrated that exponential growth does not appear to be problematic at first, but this rapidly changes. On 6 June 2021, there were 121 hospital admissions in England. While low, this is only around five doublings from the peak in January 2021. It is highly likely that at least one doubling of admissions will occur within the next two weeks as the result of the recent doubling in cases.</p>

<h3>Current epidemic estimates</h3>

<p>9. <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O’s best estimate for <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> in England is between 1.2 and 1.4 and the growth rate is between +3 per cent and +6 per cent per day, based on data available up to 7 June 2021. Estimates for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England regions are given in Appendix 2. <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is a lagging indicator, reflecting the state of the epidemic approximately two weeks ago when a smaller proportion of cases were caused by the delta variant. This estimate is significantly higher than an <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> of 1.0 to 1.1 (and a growth rate of 0 per cent to +3 per cent per day)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, which reflected the state of the epidemic shortly before Step 3 of the Roadmap was taken.</p>

<p>10. The local hotspots have coalesced into wider regional patterns. On the current trajectory, high growth areas are expected to expand further. The epidemic remains highly heterogeneous.</p>

<h3>Medium term projections and scenarios</h3>

<p>11. Each week, <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O combine estimates from several independent models to project the trajectory of the epidemic <strong>if no further changes in behaviour or policy take place.</strong> They represent what the trajectory might be if the epidemic continued to follow the trends seen in the latest available data up to 7 June 2021. <strong>They are neither forecasts nor predictions</strong> and cannot fully reflect recent changes in transmission that have not yet filtered through into surveillance data. They are published separately as <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O medium-term projections.</p>

<p>12. Three of these same models have further been used to explore the potential impact of a range of scenarios following changes in transmission. These scenarios assume <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> changes to 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, or 2.1 on 21 June 2021 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, and run for a further six weeks. These scenarios are shown <strong>on a logarithmic scale</strong> in Figure 3 (<abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>=1.2 – green; 1.5 – blue; 1.8 – yellow; 2.1 – red) for England’s hospital admissions alongside the latest medium-term projection of current trends (grey) for comparison.</p>

<p>13. A doubling time in infections of around one week is consistent with growth in hospitalisations akin to the blue line (<abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>=1.5) in Figure 3. Faster growth in infections will cause faster growth in hospitalisations a few weeks later.</p>

<p>14. Figure 3 shows that the ongoing vaccine rollout programme means that a period with <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> around 1.2 would result in a very small increase in hospital admissions. An increase of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> to 1.5 or 1.8 would result in substantial number of hospital admissions.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Eight-week scenarios for daily hospital admissions in England over a range of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> values (1.2 – green; 1.5 – blue; 1.8 – yellow; 2.1 – red) reflecting the possible impact of the easements from 21 June 2021. The grey line is <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O’s medium-term projection of current trends. All scenarios show interquartile ranges of model combinations as the shaded band. Note the logarithmic scale.</p>

<p>15. Similar scenarios, published in <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O’s Step 3 roadmap modelling, assumed a step change in transmission happened on 17 May 2021. In reality, in addition to a change in behaviour from that date, there were gradual increases in transmission in different parts of the country at different times as the delta variant spread. This means that hospital admissions have not yet settled down to a consistent trajectory across the country.</p>

<h3>Modelling Step 4 of the Roadmap</h3>

<p>16. <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O has considered the results from two academic groups that have independently modelled taking Step 4 of the Roadmap at the earliest possible date, 21 June 2021. These groups have made assumptions in the central scenarios that include:</p>

<p>a. Delta is the dominant strain, with increased transmissibility and decreased vaccine effectiveness compared to alpha. Increased risk of admission given infection is <strong>not</strong> included;</p>

<p>b. There is a step change in behaviour on 21 June 2021, but that transmission reduction remains as a result of baseline measures and behaviour change after Step 4;</p>

<p>c. Once removed, social distancing measures are never re-imposed.</p>

<p>17. <strong>All results are highly sensitive to the modelling assumptions, and extensive sensitivity analyses have been performed.</strong> The key uncertainties are laid out in this summary; full details are given in the accompanying modelling papers.</p>

<p>18. Imperial’s modelling is not described in detail in this paper but has results which are consistent with the other two groups. A full description is given their accompanying paper.</p>

<p>19. Every commissioned scenario from the two groups shows another substantial wave of hospital admissions. These waves are larger than those seen in <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O’s modelling at Step 3 of the Roadmap<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> due to the recent emergence and now dominance of the delta variant, with its increased growth advantage and decreased vaccine effectiveness compared to the alpha variant.</p>

<p>20. Figure 4 shows the results of the groups’ <strong>central scenarios</strong><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. In all instances, the confidence intervals indicate that under <strong>these particular sets of assumptions</strong>, a peak in hospital admissions that is either higher or lower than that of January 2021 is plausible.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> England infections (top), hospital admissions (second row), hospital occupancy (third row) and deaths within 28 days of a positive test (bottom) in the Warwick (left – red) and <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> (right – green) models, assuming central assumptions if Step 4 is taken on 21 June 2021 including delta being 56 per cent (Warwick) and 50 per cent (<abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>) more transmissible, two dose vaccine effectiveness against admission of 90-91 per cent (Warwick) and 90 per cent (<abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>). Peaks in occupancy and daily deaths from January 2021 and levels seen in Spring 2020 are shown by past data points and dashed horizontal line. Vertical dashed lines show the dates at which each Roadmap step is taken. Shaded regions show the 95 per cent (Warwick) and 90 per cent (<abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>) prediction/credible intervals and lines indicate the medians of the distributions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Two sets of four fan charts showing a resurgence in infections, hospital admissions, occupancy and deaths in England in the Warwick and LSHTM models." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/150430/S1287_Fig_4.2.png"></div></figure>

<p>21. There is some variation in the modelled age and vaccine status of those being admitted to hospital during the peak of the next wave. In the middle of June for each model, almost all admissions to hospital are from non- or partially vaccinated people. Models are also consistent in predicting that the proportion of admissions from vaccinated people will rise over time but disagree as to how far. This will depend on a complex mix of factors including vaccine uptake, effectiveness, and timing of the peak. Figure 5 shows the proportion of admissions split by age and vaccine status in Warwick’s central scenario. <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> project a smaller proportion of admissions being in vaccinated people whereas Imperial project a higher proportion.</p>

<p>22. This is broadly in line with <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O’s modelling of Step 2 of the Roadmap<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>, although in this iteration of modelling, a slightly smaller proportion of admissions are from vaccinated groups. The latest modelling assumes a slightly lower uptake in under 50-year olds than that previously modelled (then 80 per cent to 85 per cent in those under 30 and approx. 90 per cent in those aged 30 to 49, now in line with doses given to date in those aged 40 to 49 and 80 per cent in those aged 18 to 39).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Admissions in England, split by age group and vaccination status (unvaccinated – red with diagonal hashing; one dose – solid green; two doses – blue with horizontal hashing). Central scenario from the Warwick model.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/150431/S1287_Fig_5.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Sensitivity to growth advantage of, and vaccine effectiveness against the delta variant</h3>

<p>23. As mentioned in paragraph 7, whilst information is accruing about the transmission advantage of the delta variant, a wide range of estimates remain plausible. There is also very little data available so far on the protection given by vaccines against hospital admission and death with the delta variant. <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O has previously modelled the emergence of and possible impacts of variants with different properties, showing the sensitivity of results to the assumptions used<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>24. Figure 6 demonstrates the sensitivity to each of these factors. The three different plots show admissions in the Warwick model with vaccine effectiveness assumptions that are central (top; 90 to 91 per cent against admission after two doses), optimistic (bottom left, 95 per cent) or cautious (bottom right, 86 per cent). Within each plot, different colours represent a different assumption about the transmission advantage of delta, ranging from 20 per cent lower (blue) to 40 per cent higher (yellow) compared to the central scenario (red), where the central assumption is that delta has a 56 per cent transmission advantage over alpha.</p>

<p>25. This shows that, while there is a significant resurgence in admissions in all scenarios, <strong>the scale of that resurgence is highly uncertain and ranges from considerably smaller than January 2021 to considerably higher.</strong> The difference between the optimistic and cautious effectiveness assumptions leads to a factor of three difference in the peak height; between 20 per cent additional and 20 per cent less transmission advantage leads to a factor of five difference.</p>

<p>26. <strong>As results are so sensitive to these assumptions, <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O cannot determine with confidence whether taking Step 4 of the Roadmap on 21st June would result in a peak that might put unsustainable pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Impact of assuming various levels of transmission of the delta variant, on the number of daily hospitalisations in England for the default vaccine efficacy assumptions (top), optimistic vaccine assumptions (bottom left), and cautious vaccine assumptions (bottom right) in the Warwick model. Each line and shaded area represent transmission of delta compared to the default (red) – either 20 per cent lower (purple), 10 per cent lower (blue), 10 per cent higher (dark green), 20 per cent higher (light green), or 40 per cent higher (yellow). Dashed line represents the peak from spring 2020 and dots represent actual data, including the January 2021 peak. Shaded regions show the 95 per cent prediction intervals and lines indicate the medians of the distributions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Three fan charts showing the scale of resurgence in hospital admissions increases with the level of transmission advantage assumed for the delta variant. Relative to default assumptions, peaks are much larger if cautious vaccine efficacy is assumed." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/150432/S1287_Fig_6.png"></div></figure>

<p>27. The epidemic is at a particularly uncertain point in time and models have struggled to reconcile the rapid growth in delta cases with what appear to be currently flat hospitalisations. This may be due to reasons outlined above in paragraph 8, however, this has made it more difficult for models to successfully fit to all data streams. Delaying Step 4 would enable more time to resolve these data interpretation issues, accrue more information on the delta variant’s transmission and hospitalisation rates and observe the progression of the new delta variant epidemic before adding even faster transmission as a result of further relaxations.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity to timing of taking Step 4</h3>

<p>28. <strong>In the scenarios modelled by both groups, a short delay to the date at which Step 4 is taken significantly reduces both the height of the next peak and the total number of deaths and admissions that occur over the duration of the wave. Even a two-week delay would have a significant effect, but a four-week delay is modelled as reducing the peak in hospital admissions by around a third to a half.</strong></p>

<p>29. This is illustrated by Figure 7, showing the Warwick model with the central (top), optimistic (bottom left) and pessimistic (bottom right) vaccine effectiveness assumptions. The proportional impact is similar in each scenario, even though the scale is very different. Models assume that transmission will be significantly reduced during the school summer holidays and so a delay of four weeks that moves further relaxations into this time period has a particularly large effect.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Admissions in England in Warwick’s central (top), optimistic (bottom left) and cautious (bottom right) scenarios, if Step 4 is taken on 21 June 2021 (red) or with a delay of one to four weeks (purple to green lines) or a delay of nine weeks (yellow). Shaded regions show the 95 per cent prediction intervals and lines indicate the medians of the distributions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Three fan charts showing that the scale of resurgence in hospital admissions in England reduces as the delay in taking Step 4 increases, under central, optimistic and cautious vaccine efficacy assumptions." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/150433/S1287_Fig_7.png"></div></figure>

<p>30. In addition to allowing many more people to be protected by vaccination (thus reducing the risk of severe outcomes and the likelihood of unsustainable pressure on hospitals), a short delay to progressing to Step 4 would allow for greater clarity about the transmission advantage of delta and the extent to which vaccines offer protection against severe disease caused by it. This would provide greater certainty about the risk of taking Step 4 before it happens.</p>

<p>31. In some of the <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> scenarios, lower transmission over summer and waning immunity results in a second peak in the autumn, or an extended period of a high prevalence. This, however, does not account for either revaccination or the emergence of other variants.</p>

<p>32. As previously modelled by <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>, a two-stage process in which restrictions are partially lifted on 21 June 2021 before being removed slightly later can also significantly reduce the peak of the next wave. This is illustrated by Figure 8, showing a return to pre-pandemic behaviour on 21 June 2021 (red) or a two-stage process with partial relaxation on that date and a full relaxation five weeks later (blue).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Admissions in England in the Warwick model for default vaccine efficacy assumptions if there were a return to pre-pandemic behaviours on 21 June 2021 (dark red) or if there is a partial relaxation on that date followed by a return to pre-pandemic behaviour five weeks later (26 July 2021, blue); a two-step relaxation with first stage on 26 July 2021 and second step five weeks later (30 August 2021, green); or first stage on 30 August 2021 and second step five weeks later (4 October, yellow). Please note, this single step scenario is not the same as the other central scenarios from Warwick modelling due to assuming a return to pre-pandemic levels of contacts.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Fan chart showing a resurgence in admissions similar to Jan 2021, if pre-pandemic behaviour resumes 21 June.

<h3>Sensitivity to transmission once all restrictions are lifted after Step 4 is taken</h3>

<p>33. <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O have previously advised that an important unknowable factor is the extent to which behaviours will change after Step 4 compared to pre-pandemic, and how much baseline measures will reduce transmission.</p>

<p>34. Figure 9 shows the central scenario<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> in the <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> model with high, medium, and low transmission after Step 4, represented by high, medium or low mobility, <strong>in addition</strong> to a 30 to 40 per cent transmission reduction from baseline measures. For this set of assumptions about the delta variant, the high mobility scenario results in a resurgence of a similar size to January 2020, but the low mobility scenario is half this size.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Admissions in England in <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>’s high (blue), medium (green), and low (purple) mobility scenarios if Step 4 is taken on 21 June, assuming 50 per cent increased transmissibility relative to alpha and two dose vaccine effectiveness against admission of 90 per cent. Shaded regions show the 90 per cent credible intervals and lines indicate the medians of the distributions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Fan chart showing the scale of resurgence in admissions increases with assumed mobility levels following Step 4 in the LSHTM model. High mobility results in a median peak of similar size to January 2021 and is approximately double the low mobility peak." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/150435/S1287_Fig_9.png"></div></figure>

<h3>Sensitivity to other factors</h3>

<p>35. Other sensitivity analyses are given in the respective full modelling papers, including considering the effect of overall vaccine uptake.</p>

<p>36. As expected, a more rapid rollout of first vaccine doses would somewhat reduce the size of the next resurgence (Figure 10). The effect is smaller than in previous iterations of <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>-O modelling as first doses have been rolled out more widely, and models assumed that the time between doses is fixed (at eight weeks for those aged 50 and over, and 11 weeks for under 50-year olds).</p>

<p>37. Although there are good data on the number of vaccines administered to date, estimates of the total population, and therefore the number of unvaccinated people, vary considerably. This could mean the scale of the next wave is being under- or overestimated in these scenarios for some parts of the country.</p>

<h2>Appendix 1: Model assumptions</h2>

<p>Parameter values for B.1.1.7 are given in the respective modelling papers, alongside further details of the models. Given the dominance of B.1.617.2, the results are less sensitive to assumptions about B.1.1.7 than previously.</p>
