<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr> should aim to provide assurance that your organisation’s external systems are protected from unauthorised access or change, and they do not provide an unauthorised entry point into systems that consume <abbr title="Public Services Network">PSN</abbr> services.</p>

<p>The internal systems should be tested to provide further assurance that no significant weaknesses exist on network infrastructure or individual systems that could allow one internal device to intentionally or unintentionally impact on the security of another.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>Getting the scope of an <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr> right is one of the most important aspects in ensuring that the <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr> is a worthwhile exercise and provides you with the correct level of assurance. Your <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr> partner can assist you in setting the correct scope but as a minimum you should look to set up the following test scenarios:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>External testing</h3>

<p>This should include systems that provide services on the internet such as email servers, web servers and other systems such as the firewalls that are in place to prevent unauthorised access from the internet into your organisation.</p>

<p>External testing should also include any systems you have in place to allow staff to connect into your organisation remotely. These remote access solutions normally involve <abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> that should be tested as part of your external assurance.</p>

<p>If your organisation is dependent on third-party suppliers and they have access to and from your systems from their own office locations this should also be considered as an external connection and tested.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Internal testing</h3>

<p>Internal testing should include vulnerability scanning and manual analysis of your internal network. At a minimum it should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Desktop and server build and configuration, and network management security</li>
  <li>Patching at operating system, application and firmware level</li>
  <li>Configuration of remote access solutions (including solutions for managed devices and <abbr title="Bring Your Own Device">BYOD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Build and Configuration of laptops and other mobile devices such as phones and tablets used for remote access</li>
  <li>Internal security gateway configuration (including <abbr title="Public Services Network">PSN</abbr> gateway)</li>
  <li>Wireless network configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>These scans will look to provide assurance that your internal systems have been configured in a secure manner and are being properly maintained at all times.</p>

<p>The testing should include representative vulnerability scanning across the entire estate covering end-points (including thick and thin clients), servers, network devices and appliances. The scanning needs to include applications on devices, this is typically achieved through credentialed vulnerability scanning. In organisations with a large number of devices, you may conduct sample testing: the size of the sample must be no less than 10 per cent of your estate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Output</h2>

<p>As a minimum the output of the health check should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authors should ensure that the report is readable and accessible to the customer and contain a clear summary of the number, type and severity of the issues identified. Where possible <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System">CVSS</abbr> base scores should be included with <abbr title="Common Vulnerability Scoring System">CVSS</abbr> version 3 or 3.1 being the preferred vulnerability categorisation standard</li>
  <li>The report should provide details of the individuals involved in the <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>The report should communicate the background, scope and context of the health check in full</li>
  <li>Vulnerabilities should be accurately identified and explained</li>
  <li>Each identified vulnerability should be associated with a remedial solution.  The remedial solution should not be seen as the sole method for reducing the risk - a short-term remedial action may be appropriate until such time that a strategic fix can be put in place.  Typical short-term remediations may include a combination of network segregation, limiting access, increased monitoring and further hardening.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Choosing a testing partner</h2>

<p>For central government customers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/articles/check-fundamental-principles" rel="external">the CHECK scheme</a>, run by NCSC, is in place to guarantee quality. Organisations should ensure their chosen partner is part of this scheme.</p>

<p>For non-central government customers, Tiger Scheme, CREST-approved <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr> services or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thecyberscheme.org/" rel="external">Cyber Scheme</a> can be utilised.</p>
