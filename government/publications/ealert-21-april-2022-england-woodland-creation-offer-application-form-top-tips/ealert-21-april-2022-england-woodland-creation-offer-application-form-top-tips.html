<span class="number">1. </span>England Woodland Creation Offer Application Form top tips:</h2>

<p>Here is the final tip in our series helping you should complete your EWCO Application Form so that we have all the information we need to process your application.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Tip #5 Do not start work before you have a signed EWCO agreement</h3>

<p>It is essential that work does not begin on any EWCO-funded activity until you have a signed grant agreement.</p>

<p>Work carried out before a signed EWCO agreement will be ineligible for funding.</p>

<p>You should, however, speak to nurseries early about availability of plant supply. The more notice you can give the nursery, the more likely they are to be able to fulfill any order you make later.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>New pilot requirement for tree suppliers announced to strengthen UK biosecurity</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>A new requirement piloted to combat the threat from pests and diseases.</h3>

<p>A new requirement for the forestry sector will be piloted to combat the threat from pests and diseases and further strengthen UK biosecurity, Defra and the Forestry Commission <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-pilot-requirement-for-tree-suppliers-announced-to-strengthen-uk-biosecurity">announced yesterday</a> (Wednesday 20 April).</p>

<p>The Biosecure Procurement Requirement means that, from June 2022, new applicants for funding under the England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) and the Tree Health Pilot must commit to sourcing their trees from suppliers who are either accredited under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthy.org.uk/" rel="external">Plant Healthy Certification Scheme</a>, or who have passed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://readytoplant.fera.co.uk/" rel="external">Ready to Plant assessment, as provided by Fera Science Ltd</a>.</p>

<p>This pilot will enable suppliers to demonstrate that their operational practices comply with the industry benchmark <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthy.org.uk/resource-topics/sector-guidance-documents" rel="external">Plant Health Management Standard</a>. This Standard includes protocols which are key to developing a robust plant health management system and sets out practical requirements for suppliers to help protect the plant supply chain.</p>

<p>Professor Nicola Spence, UK Chief Plant Health Officer, said:</p>

<p>“Our biosecurity standards are among the highest in Europe. As we build back greener, we must consider new and ambitious ways to not simply maintain these standards but further strengthen them. By leading the way with this new pilot, we are addressing the significant and increasing threat of pests and diseases and building a strong biosecurity culture across the country.”</p>

<p>The Biosecure Procurement Requirement Pilot will run for 12 months from June 2022. For more information on the Biosecure Procurement Pilot Requirement, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/04/20/better-biosecurity-for-nurseries-and-our-future-woodlands/" rel="external">read our latest blog</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Lump Sum Exit Scheme</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Open for applications</h3>

<p>The voluntary Lump Sum Exit Scheme opened for applications on 12 April 2022. As set out in the Government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agricultural-transition-plan-2021-to-2024">Agricultural Transition Plan 2021 – 2024</a>, farmers who wish to leave the industry are being given the opportunity to leave in a managed way. They have the option of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selling their agricultural land in England and being given a lump sum payment; or</li>
  <li>planting the land with trees under a woodland creation scheme, with grant funding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once farmers have received a lump sum payment, they will no longer be eligible for any further Direct Payments (Basic Payment Scheme payments or delinked payments) in England. Should farmers already own woodland and opt for a lump sum payment for their agricultural land, they may choose whether to keep or sell the woodland. Farmers should be aware though that if woodland is subject to a legacy scheme (e.g. Farm Woodland Premium Scheme – FWPS, or Farm Woodland Payments – FWP), or Countryside Stewardship, the sale may be subject to succession rules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>How to apply:</h3>
<p>Farmers will be able to apply for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme up to and including 30 September 2022. Applicants then have until 31 May 2024 to transfer out their agricultural land where required. More information on how the scheme will work can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/lump-sum-exit-scheme">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside the Lump Sum Exit Scheme the government want to support new entrants coming into the industry, and Defra will be providing more details on this later this year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Grant or application deadline reminders</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>There are a few deadlines we wanted to make you aware of in the coming weeks, here’s a round-up:</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Woodland Carbon Guarantee application deadline</h3>
<p>Applications to take part in the next auction must be submitted by 23:59 on Sunday 24 April.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Woodland Carbon Guarantee application deadline</h3>

<p>The next Woodland Carbon Guarantee (WCaG) auction will take place from midday on Monday 9 May to midday on Sunday 15 May 2022.</p>

<p>Unlike most existing woodland creation support mechanisms, the WCaG is not a grant or a fund and it does not contribute towards the cost of planning, establishment or early maintenance. Woodland creation projects accepted into the Woodland Carbon Guarantee have the option to sell Woodland Carbon Units (WCUs) to the government every 5 or 10 years up to 2055/56. The government will buy the WCUs for an agreed guaranteed price that is index-linked for the life of the contract. You can still choose to sell the carbon credits on the open market at any time. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-carbon-guarantee">Read more on the WCaG and find out how to apply</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier application deadline</h3>
<p>Applications must be submitted by midnight on 29 April 2022.</p>

<p>Applications for Woodland Improvement are made under the Higher Tier, using the Woodland Improvement option (WD2) and/or capital items, including Woodland Infrastructure (FY2).</p>

<p>When you submit your Higher Tier application by email, please reply to the email that the Rural Payments Service sent you that had the application pack attached. This will help when processing your application. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/higher-tier-manual-countryside-stewardship">Read more on Higher Tier.</a></p>
