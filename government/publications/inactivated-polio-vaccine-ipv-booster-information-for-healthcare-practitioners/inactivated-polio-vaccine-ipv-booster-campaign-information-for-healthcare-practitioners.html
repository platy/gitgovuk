<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Summary of incident to date – findings and interpretation</h3>

<p>The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (<abbr title="The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr>) of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) conduct routine environmental surveillance for wild type and vaccine-like polio viruses as part of the UK’s commitment to the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) global polio eradication programme.</p>

<p>Vaccine-like type-2 poliovirus (<abbr title="vaccine-like type-2 poliovirus">PV2</abbr>) isolates were found in sewage samples collected from the London Beckton sewage treatment works in February 2022 and have persisted since. This is unusual activity and analysis has shown that all <abbr title="vaccine-like type-2 poliovirus">PV2</abbr> isolates identified since then are genetically related to each other.</p>

<p>The Beckton sewage treatment plant covers a large catchment area with a population close to 4 million across north-east and north-central London. As expected, since February, the virus has evolved and towards the end of May met the criteria of a vaccine-derived poliovirus (<abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr>) which means that it has re-acquired the mutations that cause paralysis.</p>

<p><abbr title="vaccine-derived poliovirus">VDPVs</abbr> behave more like wild type virus, can sustain outbreaks and on rare occasions lead to paralytic presentations in unvaccinated individuals.</p>

<p>It is considered most likely that an individual entered the UK in February 2022 from a country where oral polio vaccine (<abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr>) has been used for supplementary immunisation campaigns and outbreak response. Recently vaccinated individuals shed the <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr> virus in their stool for a few weeks after and this can be detected through the sewage surveillance.</p>

<p>The UK switched from using <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr> to inactivated polio vaccine (<abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>) in 2004, the year after poliovirus was declared eradicated in the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> European region.</p>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) is investigating the extent of transmission of the virus across north-east and north-central London. Based on this sampling, virus is considered to be present in sub areas of the Beckton plant covering all or parts of the following London boroughs: Barnet, Brent, Camden, Enfield, Hackney, Haringey, Islington and Waltham Forest.</p>

<p>The sampling has also detected virus in lower concentrations and frequency in areas adjacent to the Beckton catchment area to the South (immediately below the Thames) and to the East.</p>

<p>The level of <abbr title="vaccine-like type-2 poliovirus">PV2</abbr> found and the high genetic diversity among the <abbr title="vaccine-like type-2 poliovirus">PV2</abbr> isolates suggests that there is virus transmission in separate networks of individuals in these boroughs and possibly in some of the other surrounding areas. The pattern is not consistent with virus shedding by one or a few individuals.</p>

<h3>Polio vaccine programme and coverage</h3>

<p>Individuals born in the UK before 2004 will have been eligible for vaccination with <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr>. This vaccine provides good protection against polio and also provides high levels of gut immunity. Individuals born after 2004 in the UK will have received <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> which provides excellent protection from severe polio but individuals can still become infected and spread polio virus without exhibiting any symptoms.</p>

<p>Currently, hexavalent <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr> vaccine is offered routinely to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Further doses of polio containing vaccines are given at the age of 3 years and 4 months as part of the pre-school booster (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">dTaP/IPV</abbr>) and at around 14 years old (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine">Td/IPV</abbr>) as part of the teenage booster.</p>

<p>Vaccination coverage for the 3-dose primary schedule in one-year olds in London is well below that achieved for the UK on average and uptake of the pre-school booster in 5 year olds is even lower. This falls below the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> target of 95% coverage.</p>

<p>The high-density population in the areas affected and the number of individuals under-vaccinated in those boroughs suggests that there is significant potential for the <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> to continue to spread. Under-vaccinated children can become infected and pass the infection on to others. There is significant overlap between the local authorities with the lowest vaccine coverage and where <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> has been detected (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref">1,2</a>).</p>

<h3>Maternal pertussis vaccination programme – interference with primary <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> response</h3>

<p>As part of the maternal pertussis vaccination programme, introduced in 2012, a dose of polio containing vaccine (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">dTaP/IPV</abbr>) is also given in pregnancy.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/national-vaccine-evaluation-consortium">National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium (<abbr title="National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium">NVEC</abbr>)</a> iMAP2 study showed that maternal pertussis vaccination provides high levels of antibody against pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria to young infants. This provides high levels of protection against whooping cough, and the successful programme has been shown to reduce the risk of infant deaths from this disease (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref">3, 4</a>).</p>

<p>It is estimated that the maternal pertussis programme prevented between 82 to 170 infant deaths between 2012 to 2017 (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref">5</a>).</p>

<p>Unpublished evidence from the <abbr title="National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium">NVEC</abbr> study suggests that these high antibody levels may reduce the infant’s response to <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> when measured at 12 months. The clinical significance of this finding is not clear, but the lower antibody level is likely to persist up until the administration of the pre-school <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster at 3 years 4 months, and children who miss this booster dose may remain susceptible.</p>

<p>Lower uptake of the booster is especially common in affected areas of London. It is therefore plausible that the lower antibody levels might be less good at preventing <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> transmission. It is anticipated that this potential immunity gap will be corrected by the administration of a polio containing vaccine to children aged one year and above, as maternal antibodies will no longer interfere with the active immune response.</p>

<p>There are no planned changes to the maternal pertussis immunisation programme and it is still recommended for those who are pregnant.</p>

<h3>Response to date</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has declared a national enhanced incident response to coordinate the investigation and response to the polio incident. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/polio-national-guidelines">national polio guidelines</a> outline the public health considerations when a <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> is detected in environmental samples. The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> has been alerted and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continue to keep them updated with developments.</p>

<p>The NHS is strengthening ongoing work to improve uptake nationally in the routine childhood programme. In London, active call-recall of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children under the age of 5 is already underway through primary care, with a planned phased extension up to 18 year olds. However, due to the large pool of partially vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals in the affected areas of London, it is highly unlikely that this <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-catch up alone will be sufficient to prevent cases of paralysis or control the <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> spread.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advice – <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign</h3>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) met on 25 July 2022 to discuss the ongoing polio incident and agreed that the most immediate priority is to ensure all eligible individuals are up to date with their polio (<abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>) vaccinations, and they endorsed the current NHS efforts to increase coverage of the routine childhood vaccination programme nationally alongside the pro-active catch-up of partially vaccinated and unvaccinated children in London.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of this public health emergency the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> agreed that an urgent supplemental vaccination strategy is required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevent cases of paralysis due to poliovirus</li>
  <li>interrupt transmission of <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> in the community</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-strategy-for-ongoing-polio-incident-jcvi-statement"><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advised</a> that, in addition to ongoing catch-up, a supplementary <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign should be implemented for children aged 1 to 9 years old in London.</p>

<p>The recommendation was that a campaign should start as soon as possible in the London boroughs where <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> has been detected and then be expanded to all London boroughs.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advised that an <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign should be prioritised alongside other planned time sensitive immunisation programmes including coronavirus (COVID-19) and seasonal influenza.</p>

<h2>Polio vaccine coverage data for London</h2>

<p>Vaccine coverage for the primary polio vaccination course (6-in-1- <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>) in London was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>86.6% in children turning 12 months</li>
  <li>87.0% in children turning 24 months</li>
  <li>90.4% in children turning 5 years</li>
  <li>coverage was below 85% in 8 out of 33 London Local Authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>Vaccine coverage for the pre-school booster (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">dTaP/IPV</abbr>) in London was 71.4% in children turning 5 years.</p>

<p>Vaccine coverage for the teenage booster (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine">Td/IPV</abbr>) in School Year 9 children in London, 2020 to 2021 academic year was 71.7%.</p>

<p>Source: COVER October to December 2021 data (<a class="govuk-link" href="#ref">1</a>).</p>

<h2>Aim of the enhanced vaccination strategy</h2>

<p>The aim of the enhanced vaccination strategy in response to the polio incident:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to prevent cases of paralysis</li>
  <li>to interrupt transmission of <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> in the community</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy for children aged one year (turn one by 31 August 2022) to less than 10 years of age in London</h3>

<p>To offer a dose of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine to all children aged one year (by 31 August 2022) to less than 10 years of age across London:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by catching up children who are not up to date with their polio vaccinations or</li>
  <li>by offering an additional dose of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine - see <a class="govuk-link" href="#algorithm">eligibility algorithm</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rationale for the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign</h2>

<p>An additional dose of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine will help to ensure that there is a high level of protection from paralysis in the area where the <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> is circulating. A focused campaign approach, offered to all children, is likely to lead to higher vaccine coverage and will facilitate outreach to under-immunised communities.</p>

<p>The booster campaign may also contribute to interrupting transmission of <abbr title="vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus">VDPV2</abbr> in the community.</p>

<p>Children under 10 years of age are likely to be the focus of transmission because of poorer personal hygiene, and the likelihood of lower levels of polio antibodies as discussed above. Offering an additional dose to those who are vaccinated will boost antibody levels and may help to reduce or curtail asymptomatic excretion of the virus.</p>

<h2>Polio</h2>

<p>Poliomyelitis is an acute illness that follows invasion through the gastrointestinal tract by one of the 3 serotypes of polio virus (serotypes 1, 2 and 3). The virus replicates in the gut and has a high affinity for nervous tissue.</p>

<p>The infection is most frequently clinically inapparent, or symptoms may range in severity from a fever to aseptic meningitis or paralysis. Headache, gastrointestinal disturbance, malaise and stiffness of the neck and back, with or without paralysis, may occur.</p>

<p>In a small number of cases, between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 infections, the polio virus attacks the nerves in the spine and base of the brain. This can cause paralysis, usually in the legs, that develops over hours or days. If the breathing muscles are affected, it can be life threatening.</p>

<p>Transmission is through contact with the faeces or pharyngeal secretions of an infected person</p>

<p>Decades ago, before the introduction of the polio vaccination programme, around 8,000 people would develop paralysis due to polio every year in the UK.</p>

<p>Live <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr> is used in some countries around the world, particularly to respond to polio outbreaks. This vaccine generates gut immunity and for several weeks after vaccination people can shed the vaccine-virus in their faeces.</p>

<p>The UK switched from using <abbr title="oral polio vaccine">OPV</abbr> to <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> [which contains inactivated (killed) virus] in 2004, the year after poliovirus was declared eradicated in the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> European region.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccines have the same polio content (virus type and amount of antigen) and will provide an excellent boost across the whole age range. Based on existing approvals and to allow an immediate response to be implemented, 3 different products are recommended for the booster campaign as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children aged 1 year to &lt;3 years 4 months are offered the hexavalent (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>) vaccine (both Infanrix hexa and Vaxelis to be used)</li>
  <li>children aged 3 years 4 months up to and including 5 year olds are offered Boostrix-<abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">dTaP/IPV</abbr>)</li>
  <li>children aged 6 to 9 years are offered Revaxis (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine">Td/IPV</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vaccine excipients</h2>

<p>Full details of the individual vaccines and their excipients can be found in each vaccine’s summary of product characteristics (<abbr title="summary of product characteristics">SPC</abbr>):</p>

<h2>Programme introduction and eligibility</h2>

<p>Parents and carers in London who have a child who is eligible for the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign will be contacted as soon as possible and given information on how to access the vaccine. The polio booster programme will be rolled out across London in phases starting with the boroughs where poliovirus has been detected.</p>

<h3>Communication for general practice and other immunisation providers about the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign roll-out</h3>

<p>NHS London will communicate through existing routes to ensure that vaccine providers are kept up to date with operational delivery matters relating to the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign.</p>

<h2>Vaccine administration queries</h2>

<h3>Supply of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccines for the booster programme</h3>

<p>Centrally purchased vaccines for the NHS national immunisation programme and for the management of outbreaks can only be ordered via ImmForm.</p>

<p>Vaccines are provided in single dose packs as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infanrix hexa (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>): powder and suspension for suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe (<abbr title="pre-filled syringe">PFS</abbr>), (2x needles; one for reconstitution, one for injection)</li>
  <li>Vaxelis (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>): suspension for injection in <abbr title="pre-filled syringe">PFS</abbr>, (no needle)</li>
  <li>Boostrix <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> (dTap/<abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>): suspension for injection in <abbr title="pre-filled syringe">PFS</abbr>, (no needle)</li>
  <li>Revaxis (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine">Td/IPV</abbr>): suspension for injection in <abbr title="pre-filled syringe">PFS</abbr>, (no needle)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storage of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine for the booster programme</h3>

<p>All vaccines used for the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> vaccine booster programme should be stored in a pharmaceutical vaccine refrigerator within the recommended +2°C to +8°C temperature range. Vaccines should be stored in original packaging.</p>

<p>In the event of an inadvertent or unavoidable deviation of these conditions, vaccine that has been stored outside the recommended +2°C to +8°C temperature range should be quarantined and risk assessed for suitability of continued ‘off-label’ use or appropriate disposal. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccine-incident-guidance-responding-to-vaccine-errors">vaccine incident guidance: responding to errors in vaccine storage, handling and administration</a>.</p>

<h3>Legal mechanisms available to administer the vaccines</h3>

<p>The relevant vaccines can be prescribed, for example using a Patient Specific Direction (<abbr title="Patient&nbsp;Specific&nbsp;Direction">PSD</abbr>), or the relevant national template Patient Group Direction (<abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr>) may be used. These include <abbr title="Patient Group Directions">PGDs</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>

<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hexavalent-vaccine-dtapipvhibhepb-infanrix-hexa-pgd-template">hexavalent vaccines (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>) <abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr></a> version 04.00, valid from 25 July 2022</li>

</ul>

<p>Please note these <abbr title="Patient Group Directions">PGDs</abbr> must be organisationally authorised in section 2 before being adopted by provider organisations and section 7 also completed.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr> templates for Infanrix hexa/Vaxelis, Boostrix-<abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> and Revaxis vaccines all allow for use of the vaccine as a booster in an outbreak response scenario.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Patient Group Directions">PGDs</abbr> for the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccines have been reviewed and updated to allow use of the vaccines in the target age ranges in this outbreak response.</p>

<h3>Child given the ‘incorrect’ vaccine recommended for their age</h3>

<p>If a child who was being brought up to date is given an incorrect vaccine, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vaccination-of-individuals-with-uncertain-or-incomplete-immunisation-status">vaccination of individuals with uncertain or incomplete immunisation status algorithm</a> should be followed to establish how best to catch them up at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>For example, if Revaxis (<abbr title="tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine">Td/IPV</abbr>) is given in error instead of Boostrix <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio">dTaP/IPV</abbr>) to a child who has not had their pre-school booster then an additional vaccine would be required after an interval of 4 weeks to ensure the child is protected against pertussis. This will then also allow for the dose to be counted as a pre-school booster for coverage estimates and GP payments.</p>

<p>All the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccines have the same polio content and contain ingredients for virus types 1, 2 and 3 so no action needs to be taken if the incorrect <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine is used for age as part of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign. No additional <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> doses would be required.</p>

<h3>Giving other vaccines at the same time as the additional <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine</h3>

<p>The additional <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines including measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella vaccine">MMR</abbr>) and flu. All efforts should be made to ensure the child is brought up to date with any other vaccines that they may have missed.</p>

<h3>Additional dose of <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr>-containing vaccine and the possibility of side effects</h3>

<p>Parents should be informed that there may be some short-lasting redness, swelling or tenderness in the arm around the injection site. Some children may develop a mild temperature or irritability but this should only last for a day or two.</p>

<p>As with all vaccines and other medicines, healthcare practitioners and patients are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external">Yellow Card reporting site</a>.</p>

<h3>Additional use of polio-containing vaccine in other countries</h3>

<p>Many countries in Europe, the US and Canada already routinely offer an additional dose of polio-containing vaccine as part of their national immunisation schedules.</p>

<h3>Immunising children from outside London if they are visiting or staying with family in the catchment areas</h3>

<p>The programme is targeted at eligible children resident in London, starting with the key affected boroughs where <abbr title="vaccine-like type-2 poliovirus">PV2</abbr> is circulating.</p>

<h3>Older siblings (over the age of 9 years) attending clinic at the same time as a younger member of the family</h3>

<p>Children over the age of 9 years are not eligible for the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> booster campaign. However, this is an opportunity to check their vaccination status and advise on how they can be brought up to date if they have missed out on any of their vaccinations.</p>

<h2>The next steps</h2>

<p>The impact of the <abbr title="inactivated polio vaccine">IPV</abbr> campaign will be evaluated through monitoring of vaccine coverage (including inequalities), continued environmental surveillance, and enhanced surveillance of paralytic polio presentations. Other studies, such as stool surveys, are also being explored to determine whether further interventions are required.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will continue to closely monitor emerging evidence around the polio incident and the control measures deployed. <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> will issue further advice on additional interventions if required.</p>
