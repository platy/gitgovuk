</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Political context</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Parliament</h3>

<p>The system of parliamentary rule means that it is the Parliament (the ‘Storting’) that determines the composition of the Norwegian Government. Parliament introduces legislation, authorises public spending, imposes taxes and controls the work of the Government. There are 169 elected Members of Parliament. Parliamentary elections take place every four years using a proportional representation system. There are no by-elections, nor is there any constitutional provision to dissolve the Storting between elections. The next parliamentary elections will take place in September 2025.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Government</h3>

<p>The current government came to power in 2021 and is a minority coalition between the Labour and the Centre Party, led by Jonas Gahr Støre as the Prime Minister.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Political priorities</h3>

<p>Domestically, the government is prioritising climate and energy reforms, committing to a 55% cut in emissions by 2030, raising the carbon tax and preparing the Norwegian economy for a reduction in petroleum income. The new government has an ambition to contribute to a “safer, more just and greener world”, enhance Nordic cooperation, increase contribution to UN peacekeeping.  A general tax reform, including lowering business tax, and reducing economic dependence on the fossil fuel industries, as well as investing heavily in infrastructure is high on the agenda. Other priorities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employment</li>
  <li>Climate and energy policy</li>
  <li>Stimulating High North protection and activities</li>
  <li>Education and research (both domestically and as part of its humanitarian aid programmes)</li>
  <li>Humanitarian aid - the overseas development budget has increased by more than 50% under the present government</li>
  <li>Regional consolidation of public services</li>
  <li>Sustainable ocean and blue economic development</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>International relations</h3>

<p>Norway is active on many global issues, particularly conflict resolution, counterterrorism, development assistance and climate change. They are a committed NATO member and see the alliance as central to their national defence. Contribution in 2021 was 1.85 % of the state budget.</p>

<p>Although not an EU member, Norway aligns with many EU foreign policy positions, including on sanctions. Norway participates in the EU single market through the EEA Agreement. Europe is vitally important for Norwegian trade and Norway works hard to influence EU policy where it can. Norway is also a leading aid donor providing 1% of GDP to official development assistance (ODA) and active in international peace and reconciliation processes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Economy</h2>

<p>Oil and gas exports and related services, energy intensive industries and manufacturing, fisheries and shipping keep Norway in the top ten highest per capita wealth in the world. Since 2014, declining oil exports have impacted the economy and stimulated efforts to diversify. Although the Norwegian continental shelf has decades of production to come, the current government is keen to support a transition towards sustainable economic activities. Norway has a long tradition of state ownership, which the current government is looking to moderately reduce.</p>

<p>GDP grew by 4.6% in 2021 and is currently at NOK 766.252 per capita, 40% more than the average in the EU. Total exports in 2021 amounted to NOK 1.368bn and NOK 883bn. in imports. The UK is Norway’s largest trading partner, whilst Norway is the UK’s 11th. Total trade in goods and services between the UK and Norway was £27.6 billion in 2021. Consumer price index is at 3.2%. Unemployment is at 3.4% of labour force at the end of 2021. Household debt is at 207.55% of disposable income, while government debt is at 41.4% of GDP. Household savings were at 16.7% of household disposable income. Labour compensation per hour worked saw a 4.2% growth rate in 2021. Trade in goods and services accounted for 32.52% of GDP.</p>

<p>Norway enjoyed the highest recorded oil and gas exports with over 68.5bn GBP in 2021, almost three times that of 2020, predominantly due to the record high gas prices across Europe.  £12.5bn was invested in the petroleum sector in Norway in 2021.</p>

<p>According to the Norwegian Seafood Council, Norway exported 3m tonnes of salmon, king crab, snow crab and mackerel in 2021 worth £9.9bn, an increase of 14.3% from 2020.</p>

<p>Norway supplies 40% of the UK’s energy needs and 48.8% of the UK’s exports to Norway are services. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global has as of 1 January 2022 invested USD 91.4bn in the UK (7% of all investments).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>In Norway, human rights are protected under the Constitution, the Human Rights Act and specific legislation in certain areas. In the event of conflict with domestic law, the provisions of the UN conventions incorporated through the Human Rights Act prevail over other Norwegian legislation.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Anti-Discrimination Act prohibits direct and indirect discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, family background, skin colour, language, religion and belief. Norwegian society is characterised by a high level of gender equality, coming second in the World Economic Forum’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/gender-gap-2020-report-100-years-pay-equality" rel="external">Global Gender Gap Report 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Trade union membership is common in Norway (50%), and two thirds of employees are covered by a collective agreement. Norway has been the destination for large-scale labour migration from EU countries in Eastern and Central Europe, presenting some challenges for authorities to ensure foreign workers enjoy wages and labour conditions that are in accordance with Norwegian legislation and collective agreements. There is no statutory minimum wage in Norway.</p>

<p>Norway is a member of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/" rel="external">Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs)</a>, an initiative involving governments, companies, and non-governmental organizations that promotes implementation of a set of principles that guide oil, gas and mining companies on providing security for their operations in a manner that respects human rights. Norway is also a Member State of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://icoca.ch/the-code/" rel="external">International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (ICoC) Association</a>, an initiative working with private security companies to set out international principles and standards for the responsible provision of private security services.</p>

<p>Norway hosts the secretariat of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eiti.org/" rel="external">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)</a>. This organisation works for good governance and transparency in the oil, gas and mining industries, and the countries benefiting from them. The focus of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is as prominent in Norway as in the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>In 2021 Norway ranked fourth in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nor" rel="external">Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI)</a>. Recent media headlines covering corruption in Norwegian companies’ international operations, as well as domestic incidents of unjustified entertainment have intensified public scrutiny on bribery and corruption.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Intellectual property</h2>

<p>The Free Trade Agreement between UK, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway includes precedented commitments on Intellectual Property (IP) that provide high standards of protection for, and enforcement of, IP rights. These include registered IP rights such as patents, trademarks and designs, unregistered rights such as copyright as well as trade secrets. These provisions refer to, and in many areas exceed, the standards set out in international agreements such as the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties. The Agreement between UK and Norway went into force December 2021.</p>

<p>Norwegian IP legislation mirrors that of the EU and Norway is also party to most important international conventions in the area of intellectual property rights, including the TRIPS Agreement, the Paris Convention, the Berne Convention, the Patent Cooperation Treaty and the European Patent Convention (EPC).</p>
