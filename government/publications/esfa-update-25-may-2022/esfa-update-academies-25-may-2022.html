<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: 2022 to 2023 schools supplementary grant school level allocations and conditions of grant for academies</h2>

<p>We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-supplementary-grant-2022-to-2023">schools supplementary grant (SSG) school-level allocations and conditions of grant</a>. This follows the announcement of an extra £1.2 billion allocated to mainstream schools and academies to provide support for the costs of the Health and Social Care Levy and wider costs.</p>

<p>We intend to include the SSG in the core schools budget allocation from financial year 2023 to 2024.</p>

<p>Academies will receive their payment in June 2022, to cover April 2022 to August 2022 and in November 2022, to cover September 2022 to March 2023.</p>

<p>As academies funding follows an academic year rather than a financial year, an additional payment will be made to academies to cover April to August 2023. This will be allocated using the same rates and pupil numbers as the 2022 to 2023 grant and will represent 5/12s of their 2022 to 2023 allocations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: school capacity survey 2022</h2>

<p>The school capacity (SCAP) survey is an annual data collection of school capacity, pupil forecasts and planned capacity changes. Local authorities must complete the return for all mainstream schools in their area including academies, free schools, UTCs and studio schools.</p>

<p>The department uses the data to support a range of funding, policy and operational decisions, so it is important the data is accurate.</p>

<p>The SCAP 2022 survey opens on 6 June. Your local authority may contact you to confirm current school capacity or planned capacity changes. If so, you should work with them to accurately report capacity data. Academy capacity in SCAP will usually be based on the capacity recorded in the school’s funding agreement but should reflect the latest position if subsequent changes have been made.</p>

<p>Further information on reporting academy capacity is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-capacity-survey-guide-for-local-authorities">SCAP guidance</a>.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Information: changes to the Schools Financial Benchmarking front page</h2>

<p>We have been exploring ways to improve the front page of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Schools Financial Benchmarking site</a> to ensure that users can more quickly and easily access parts of the site that are useful to them.</p>

<p>Now, after searching for your school’s front page you will also find a ‘Quick Comparison’ and your school’s ‘Self Assessment Dashboard’ on the very first page you visit. Additionally, we’ve added a ‘Next Steps’ section to help Schools Business Professionals, and others, access additional resources that will help them have an impact in their school.</p>

<p>If users wish to provide feedback, or apply to take part in user testing on new developments (such as a planned Trust Dashboard feature) please do email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:school.resourcemanagement@education.gov.uk">school.resourcemanagement@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<span class="number">13. </span>Information: call for volunteers for improving school estate management support</h2>

<p>DfE are looking for volunteers to form a working group to help improve school estate management and develop more support to the sector. We are looking for volunteers with a range of experiences – including school business professionals , estate professionals, and those who are less experienced or finding it challenging to implement strategic estate management in their schools.</p>

<p>Joining the working group will give you the opportunity to inform and test the products and services we’re developing, including updates to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/">good estate management for schools (GEMS)</a>, which we committed to in the recently published sustainability and climate change strategy. We want to hear from you to understand the challenges you face, and how we can best support schools, trusts and other responsible bodies to manage their estates well.</p>

<p>We hope to host meetings virtually every quarter, while there may also be the opportunity to form smaller project-specific working groups, depending on your interests, experience and time. If you are interested or would like further information, please <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:contact.GEMS@education.gov.uk">contact Maz Lees</a> in the Improving Estate Management team.</p>
