<span class="number">12. </span>Information: call for volunteers for improving school estate management support</h2>

<p>DfE are looking for volunteers to form a working group to help improve school estate management and develop more support to the sector. We are looking for volunteers with a range of experiences – including school business professionals , estate professionals, and those who are less experienced or finding it challenging to implement strategic estate management in their schools.</p>

<p>Joining the working group will give you the opportunity to inform and test the products and services we’re developing, including updates to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/">good estate management for schools (GEMS)</a>, which we committed to in the recently published sustainability and climate change strategy. We want to hear from you to understand the challenges you face, and how we can best support schools, trusts and other responsible bodies to manage their estates well.</p>

<p>We hope to host meetings virtually every quarter, while there may also be the opportunity to form smaller project-specific working groups, depending on your interests, experience and time. If you are interested or would like further information, please <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:contact.GEMS@education.gov.uk">contact Maz Lees</a> in the Improving Estate Management team.</p>
