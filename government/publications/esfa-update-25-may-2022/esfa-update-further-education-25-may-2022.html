<span class="number">3. </span>Reminder: traineeship employer incentive ends 31 July 2022</h2>

<p>An incentive can be claimed by an employer for an eligible work experience placement lasting for the minimum period of 70 hours that is complete by 31 July 2022, in line with the employer incentive guidance in the Traineeship Framework.</p>

<p>For eligible work placements that are completed on or before 31 July 2022, the incentive must be claimed before the R14 return. We would encourage all providers to ensure that employers submit their claims to allow enough time to allow for any ILR checks and resubmissions. Any errors identified after R14 submission cannot be amended and may result in non-payment of the incentive if we cannot verify the claim.</p>

<p>Providers can review the support guidance and information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-young-people-to-develop-the-skills-for-apprenticeships-and-sustainable-employment-framework-for-delivery/traineeships-framework-for-delivery-2020-to-2021-web-accessible-version#employer-incentive-payments">Traineeships Framework</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: temporary exception to Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (RoATP) requirements for supporting providers (subcontractors) delivering training and testing for the Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver CPC)</h2>

<p>In response to supply issues for driver training and testing in the transport sector we are introducing a temporary flexibility to support training providers to increase their capacity to deliver training and testing for the acquisition of the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver CPC).</p>

<p>Supporting providers (subcontractors) that only deliver the training and licence acquisition for the Driver CPC on behalf of a main provider, are temporarily excepted from the requirement to be on the RoATP.</p>

<p>This temporary exception is effective from 25 May 2022 until 31 July 2023 inclusive. Further details and information on how providers can utilise this temporary exception will be communicated shortly.  Enquires can be directed to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:RoATPSubcontracting.Exceptions@education.gov.uk">RoATPSubcontracting.Exceptions@education.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: external governance reviews for FE and sixth-form corporations and designated institutions</h2>

<p>New guidance is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/external-governance-reviews-guide-for-fe-college-corporations-and-designated-institutions">external governance reviews for FE and sixth-form college corporations and designated institutions</a>. Aimed at governors and governance professionals, the guidance will help you to prepare for and approach a review, plus select a reviewer.</p>

<p>A requirement for 3-yearly external governance reviews was introduced in funding agreements for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: advanced learner loans funding and performance management rules version 2 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advanced-learner-loans-funding-rules-2022-to-2023">version 2 of the ESFA advanced learner loans funding and performance management rules</a> 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The rules apply to all providers of education and training holding a loan facility condition and loans bursary fund agreement with ESFA.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: local authority high needs funding: 2022 to 2023 operational guide survey</h2>

<p>We’d like to gather user feedback on the content and format of the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding: 2022 to 2023 operational guide</a>. We’ll use feedback received from the survey to inform and shape future publications of the guide.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dferesearch.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6gLlOLbU8R90ZGm?jfefe=new" rel="external">access the survey</a> and submit your responses by 27 June 2022. Please note, this survey is optional.</p>

<p>The survey should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact us via email at</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CRM.QUERIES@education.gov.uk">CRM.QUERIES@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your participation and contributions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: new notification function available for the individualised learner record (ILR) guidance</h2>

<p>We have published our new notification service on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">ILR website</a>.</p>

<p>This is located on the top right of the home page and also currently featured in the ‘latest updates’ section in the middle of the page.</p>

<p>By subscribing to notifications this will allow you to receive notifications via both email and SMS text messaging. The notifications are directly linked to the latest updates section, and we also have the functionality to link to more specific sections and years on the site as and when required.</p>

<p>An example of how this will work, when we publish future Validation rule specifications, we will link the notification to an article on the latest updates section. This will provide some detail of changes and a link to the actual document on the site. If we update multiple sections of the ILR or provider support manual, rather than receiving an update for each change, it will be summarised under a latest update article which will link to the particular document.</p>

<p>We hope this will be a useful addition and welcome feedback through the link on the home page.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Your feedback: UK-wide survey on language provision in further education</h2>

<p>We would like to invite your college to take part in a UK-wide survey on language provision in further education. It is a pivotal time for languages and we hope that you will participate. Even if your college does not currently offer any language courses, we still want to hear from you.</p>

<p>The study is funded by the British Academy, the UK’s national academy for the humanities and social sciences, and organised by a team of researchers at Queen’s University Belfast.</p>

<p>There are two surveys: one for your head of languages/internationalisation and one for all students, full-time and part-time, even if they do not study languages.</p>

<p>Please could you forward the staff link to your head of languages/internationalisation and share the student survey link with all of your students, through your college email system and/or virtual learning environment and/or social media channels.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://response.questback.com/queensuniversitybelfast/student" rel="external">Student link</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Completing the survey should take no more than 15 minutes and the deadline is Thursday 26th May 2022, but ideally we would like your response as soon as possible.&nbsp;The report will be available in autumn 2022.</p>

<p>We would like to thank you very much in advance for your response. If you have any queries or difficulties accessing the survey, or if you would like to complete the survey in Welsh, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:i.collen@qub.ac.uk">i.collen@qub.ac.uk</a>.</p>
