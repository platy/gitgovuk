<p>Version 1</p>
</div>

<p>1. In response to high intake of Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children (UASC) and the current need to accommodate UASC in interim hotels a temporary amendment has been made to the terms under which local authorities can claim Home Office funding in respect to their costs of supporting unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC). This annex should be read in conjunction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unaccompanied-asylum-seeking-children-uasc-grant-instructions">funding instructions</a>.</p>

<p>2. Following the Minister for Safe and Legal Migration’s announcement about changes to the National Transfer Scheme (NTS) on 24 August 2022, local authorities will receive an additional £2,000 per month per child for the first three months where the child transfers from an interim hotel to the local authority placement within five working days.</p>

<p>3. This funding is in addition to the usual funding arrangements set out in the UASC and former UASC care leavers 2022/23 funding instructions. Local authorities supporting UASC at 0.07% or greater of their general population on 31 March 2022 receive the higher rate contribution of £143 per child per night for each UASC.</p>

<p>4. Any local authority receiving a child transferred under the NTS receives a funding contribution at the higher rate of £143 per child per night.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>5. The funding applies to any child who transfers via the NTS from 24 August from UASC contingency accommodation, where the transfer to the local authority placement is completed within five working days of the local authority receiving the referral. Day one is counted as the working day following the local authority receiving the NTS referral. The funding begins from the date the child transfers to the local authority placement and ceases after three months.</p>

<h2>Cessation</h2>

<p>6. In line with the UASC funding instruction payment will cease if a child goes missing from the care placement for longer than 28 days or where the child is placed into a Young Offenders Institute. In these instances the funding will be pro-rated for the days the child was in the local authority’s care (see section 4 of the UASC funding instruction).</p>

<p>7. In line with the UASC funding instruction where a UASC is age disputed the £2,000 monthly payment will be made for a maximum of one month for those individuals who are assessed to be adults. If the local authority assesses the individual to be an adult before the month is concluded the local authority will receive the funding pro-rated for the days the individual was in their care. Where the claimed age is accepted the local authority is required to resolve the age dispute with asylum operations in order to receive the maximum three month funding (see section 6 of the UASC funding instruction).</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>8. Exceptions will be considered on a case by case basis if a child’s transfer was delayed beyond the control of the receiving local authority and in the best interests of the child.</p>

<h2>Claims</h2>

<p>9. Local authorities should indicate in the notes on the funding submission sheet where the child is eligible for the additional funding. Where there are any queries local authorities should contact the UASC and former UASC care leaver funding team.</p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>10. For queries relating to this annex or UASC funding more generally please contact the Home Office UASC and former UASC care leaver funding team: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UASCLAFundingTeam@homeoffice.gov.uk">UASCLAFundingTeam@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>
