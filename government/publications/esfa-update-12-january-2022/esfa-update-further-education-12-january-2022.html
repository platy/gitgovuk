<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: T Level Transition Programme publication of revised Framework for Delivery</h2>

<p>We have published the revised <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2022-to-2023" class="govuk-link">Framework for Delivery</a> for providers delivering the T Level Transition Programme from September 2022 onwards.</p>

<p>Alongside the Framework, we have published national technical outcomes for the first 7 T Level routes, a student guide, and resources to help providers develop their programmes.</p>

<p>The Transition Programme provides a high-quality route onto T Levels for students who would benefit from the additional study time and preparation the programme will give them before they start their T Level.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: updated college good practice guide on the scope of work of audit committees</h2>

<p>We have refreshed our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-corporation-financial-management-good-practice-guides" class="govuk-link">good practice guide on the scope of work of audit committees in college corporations</a> to better align it with the requirements of the Post-16 Audit Code of Practice.</p>

<p>In particular we have enhanced the section on risk management, placed greater emphasis on the importance of learner data, cyber security risks  and introduced new sections on value for money and committee papers.</p>

<p>We have also reflected further input from audit professionals active in the sector on how the audit plan may be developed and expanded the range of systems and processes that might be considered for inclusion in the programme of work.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: disability workforce reporting consultation</h2>

<p>The Disability Unit in the Cabinet Office have launched a consultation to explore the topic of workforce reporting on disability, both voluntary and mandatory for large employers (250 employees and above).</p>

<p>They want to hear more about the views and experiences of employers and employees. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/disability-workforce-reporting">Further information about the consultation and how you can feed in your views</a> is available on GOV.UK.  Alternatively, you can go directly to the <a rel="external" href="https://equalityhub.citizenspace.com/disability-unit/disability-workforce-reporting-consultation/" class="govuk-link">online survey</a>.</p>

<p>The consultation will be open until Friday 25 March 2022.</p>

<p>Further information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-disability-strategy-and-related-publications">National Disability Strategy and related publications</a> are available on GOV.UK along with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-launched-on-disability-workforce-reporting" class="govuk-link">consultation press notice</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: for colleges that run home-to-college transport for students regarding exemptions from Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR)</h2>

<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) wrote to colleges on 1 October 2021 regarding the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000 (PSVAR) which require all buses and coaches which have more than 22 seats and carry at least one fare-paying passenger to have features which enable disabled people to board, alight and travel in comfort and safety. They explained that temporary exemptions from the PSVAR were available for “closed door” home-to-school services (services which cannot be boarded by members of the public). They suggested then that colleges may wish to speak to the operators of the transport they arrange for students, in order to ensure that their vehicles either comply with or fall outside the scope of the PSVAR, or that an exemption has been granted.</p>

<p>We are also aware that there may be colleges who run their own home-to-college transport that is not contracted through a transport operator. If a college does run its own home-to-school transport using a bus or a coach with more than 22 seats, on which it carries at least one fare-paying passenger, these vehicles would also be in scope of the regulations and also require an exemption.</p>

<p>Exemptions were due to expire on the 31 March 2022. We are writing now to let you know that DfT will be extending the exemptions until 31 July 2022. DfT will contact the affected operators directly. After the exemptions expire, vehicles that remain unable to comply with the PSVAR will need a further medium-term exemption to continue to operate. DfT will write to operators in due course to set out the terms in which these exemptions will be issued, at which point we will also be communicating this information with colleges.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about PSVAR or the exemptions, please contact DfT at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HometoSchoolExemptions@dft.gov.uk">HometoSchoolExemptions@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You may wish to also be aware that DfT has asked local transport authorities and bus operators to prioritise routes that serve schools and colleges, should staff absences affect the number of services they are able to operate at this challenging time.</p>
