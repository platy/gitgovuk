<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>At the Ministry of Justice, we have seen how digital services have transformed our users’ experiences and their journeys profoundly. Since the pandemic there has been a remarkable increase in the use of technology across all of our services, from remote parole and court hearings, to virtual prison visits, and a significant increase in virtual and hybrid meetings. I am therefore delighted that over the next three years, the Ministry of Justice will be building on these successes through continued investment in our digital and technology services.</p>

<p>This strategy sets out our ambition to change the user experience of justice by providing simpler, faster and better services for everyone. Every part of our organisation has already been transformed by the rapidly changing landscape of new technologies. By delivering this change, we will strengthen the wider justice system, helping us to deliver on the MOJ’s goals: reducing reoffending, providing swift access to justice and protecting the public.</p>

<p>With strong digital services as our foundation we can continue with the work we’ve already started. Seeing all of the data we gather as an asset will help us make decisions that are better informed and offer measurable outcomes. We know that being able to manage and respond rapidly to change is an absolute necessity. As an organisation, we must continually develop our capacity to be flexible and to respond effectively when faced with new challenges. This means moving away from services designed around existing, complex processes towards services that are designed with the user at their heart.</p>

<p>Our work will be carried out by teams that have the multi-disciplinary skills we need to deliver effectively, whether they be digital, policy or operational. By being focused on our users’ needs, we can bring together people from all our professions to deliver a world class justice system that works for everyone.</p>

<p>There will be many challenges, but I am absolutely confident that by working together and keeping our focus on the people we serve, we will be able to deliver.</p>

<p>Jo Farrar, Second Permanent Secretary, MoJ and CEO, HMPPS</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When setting out our strategy for the next three years, it is clear that we are not starting from a blank page. Operating within the Justice system means that we work in an extremely complex environment running a number of nationally important services. Across the Ministry of Justice, we maintain more than 800 live services and 95,000 devices. We support prisoners and members of the public as well as 86,000 internal colleagues operating across 13 organisations and 1,000 sites. We play an important role in enabling over £1.5bn in legal aid to be paid each year, issuing over 500,000 Lasting Powers of Attorney, and supporting over 4 million in-person and remote court cases every year.</p>

<p>We face many of the same challenges as other large complex organisations, whether commercial or providers of public services. We have technical debt, including poorly understood monolithic legacy systems; we don’t have the luxury of unlimited funding, people or capacity to change; and we have to deliver within complex legal policies and frameworks.</p>

<p>We have a multitude of roles to play in the delivery of this strategy. We have to be a safe pair of hands to keep our existing services running. We have to be fixers, continually improving the performance and security of our many services. We have to be disrupters, challenging the status quo and creating services that better meet the needs of our users. And we have to be creators, generating fundamental shifts in the way in which we deliver, govern and fund services.</p>

<p>The challenge is both immense and invigorating, and the opportunities vast. I am proud and excited to have the opportunity to lead a hugely talented team in the delivery of this strategy and ultimately play a part in delivering simpler, faster and better justice services.</p>

<p>Gina Gill, Chief Digital and Information Officer, MoJ</p>

<h2>Strategic Themes</h2>

<p>An essential part of our strategy is to avoid overstretching and instead sharpen our focus on finishing key initiatives that will serve as springboards for faster evolution of our organisation as a whole. Therefore, we have identified three strategic themes that will enable us to move forward. We will concentrate on initiatives within some of our agencies more specifically, as well as cross-cutting work on our core infrastructure and end user computing services. The aim is to set the model and the pace for fuller organisational change beyond 2025.</p>

<h3>We must become a more flexible organisation</h3>

<p>We need to build flexibility into our systems so we can respond quickly and easily to change. As policies change and as our organisation tries to move, our large, complex systems present challenges and hinder change at pace. This leads to frustration for users who often have to try and manage their way through unintuitive, outdated systems and for the department with improvements or new processes taking too long to implement. We need to reduce that complexity and increase the pace at which we can implement change.</p>

<h3>We must be driven by data</h3>

<p>We need to make the best possible use of our data to ensure that decision making is based on sound insight. For our users this could mean very different things, from making the right safety data available to prison officers, to providing analysts with the long-term rich data sets they need to see trends in court data. Above all, we want to look at the full system, developing deep insight into the impact of our interventions and services. Our digital, data and analysis teams will work in partnership to transform the use of data across the whole Justice system. Our digital teams will play a key role in making data available, extracting it from legacy systems, email inboxes and filing cabinets, and building simple digital services and platforms that offer easy access and use.</p>

<h3>We must be led by users</h3>

<p>We need to build our services around the people who use them, reducing complexity and focusing on what matters. By working together in multidisciplinary teams made of policy, operational and digital colleagues, we will ensure that all our services are truly user led, efficient and nimble. Together we will develop policy, processes and digital services that meet the needs of our users.</p>

<h2>What we will be delivering</h2>

<p>Our aim is to ensure that we have a clear, well-understood set of goals that we can pursue. As we start to complete the different phases of work, we will learn and iterate to ensure that we are delivering what our users need.</p>

</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-hmcts-reform-programme">HMCTS Reform Programme</a> was started in 2016, to improve digital and technology services across the courts and tribunal system. As it moves into the next phase, the focus will be on upgrading legacy systems and building new digital services.</p>

<h2>Measuring Success</h2>

<p>For any strategy to be successful, we need to measure it. We need to know that we are making the right decisions, and putting our resources towards what will make the most significant difference to our users. This means embedding these themes in all decision-making, prioritisation and resourcing processes, and continually tracking our progress.</p>

<h3>Flexible Organisation</h3>

<p>We will evidence a reduced reliance on legacy systems and contracts that restrict our ability to be flexible and responsive. We will move more of our services to the cloud to create both resilience and flexibility. Our key business critical services will be more secure and resilient, we will be able to make changes faster and more safely, and unplanned downtime will be reduced.</p>

<h3>Driven by Data</h3>

<p>We will show that we have made key data available for decision making. All of our new services will be built with APIs as standard, we will unlock data from our monolithic legacy systems and we will move information from paper to digital sources. We will also demonstrate that we are able to make better decisions about our digital services through better tooling and data.</p>

<h3>Led by Users</h3>

<p>We will demonstrate that our services are built with the user at their heart through high levels of uptake of those services and great user satisfaction scores. Our services will be secure, reliable and accessible giving users the comfort that their data is safe. We will show that our services have made processes simpler and faster for our users.</p>

<h2>Changing the user experience of justice - simpler, faster &amp; better for everyone</h2>

<p>This is our strategy for the next three years. We’ve been given the mandate and support we need to really change how we are building and operating the digital services that the justice system relies on. Our aim is to set out clearly and comprehensively what we want to focus on, and why we think it will deliver transformative change across the justice system.</p>
