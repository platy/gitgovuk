<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The government is taking forward the Law Commission’s recommended communications offences (and the cyberflashing offence), through the Online Safety Bill. These new offences ensure criminal law is focused on the most harmful behaviour online, while protecting free expression.</p>

<p>In their review, ‘Modernising the Communications Offences’, the Law Commission recommended that the Malicious Communications Act 1988 and section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 be replaced with the new communications offences, given these existing laws are out of date to deal with harmful communications online.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Malicious Communication Act 1988 and section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 require that the content of the communication should fit into proscribed categories of content. These categories use vague and ambiguous language, including ‘grossly offensive’, which are often unclear for online users, technology companies and law enforcement agencies alike. They also risk overcriminalization, given the low thresholds of harm such as distress, anxiety, annoyance or inconvenience and can prosecute communications including consensual texting between adults, which could be considered ‘indecent’, for example.</p>

<p>The new communications offences and particularly, the harmful communication offence, fix these problems. They address harms arising from abusive or harmful communications online, ensuring there is no undue restriction on the right to freedom of expression.</p>

<p>The new offences also contain a higher mental element, that the defendant sends a communication intending to cause harm to the likely audience. This formulation of the mental element is a higher threshold for prosecution than the existing legislation which requires proof that a person committed an act in order to bring about a particular result.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the concept of ‘serious distress’ in the harmful communications offence has led to concerns that the threshold for committing the offence has been lowered. This is not true and neither the case for several reasons:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>‘Serious distress’ is found in existing criminal offences (such as controlling or coercive behaviour and stalking involving fear of serious violence or serious alarm or distress, both of which refer to ‘serious alarm or distress which has a substantial adverse effect on [a person’s] usual day-to-day activities’) and is commonly found in sentencing provisions for a whole range of offences. It is not an unusual concept for the courts to apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Simple distress’ (not necessarily ‘serious distress’) appears in a range of commonplace criminal offences (such as harassment and certain public order offences). The term has no special legal definition – it is to be treated as an ordinary word – but case law has held that the word has to be understood bearing in mind it is used in the context of a criminal offence that can carry a penalty of imprisonment or a substantial fine. Courts have thus held that the harm needs to be more than trivial, and that distress is therefore a ‘relatively strong word’ requiring, at the very least, ‘real emotional disturbance’. ‘Serious distress’ needs therefore to be understood as, at the least, a real emotional disturbance to a grave (serious) degree (i.e. beyond that required for harassment etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the problems with the existing communications offences is that they could over-criminalise in certain situations. They contain vague terms, like ‘grossly offensive’ and ‘indecent’, which could criminalise some forms of free expression that ought to be protected. In other words, these adjectives do not always correspond to harm. Even consensual texting between adults could be ‘indecent’, but is not obviously worthy of criminalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are other elements of the offence that narrow its scope and thereby act as safeguards. First, the prosecution must prove that the defendant intended to cause harm by sending the message. Second, there must have been a real and substantial risk that the message would cause harm to someone likely to encounter it. Finally, the court must decide whether the defendant had a reasonable excuse for sending the message, and in so doing, consider whether the message was or was intended to be a contribution to a matter of public interest.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Specifics of the offence</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Harmful communications offence</h3>

<p>Under the harmful communications offence, the following elements would have to be proven in court:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>A defendant sent a message (letter, article or electronic communication).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of sending the message, there was a real and substantial risk that it would cause harm to a likely audience (and harm is psychological harm, amounting to at least serious distress).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person intended to cause harm to a likely audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant had no reasonable excuse for sending the message (which must include consideration of whether the message was or was intended to be a contribution to a matter of public interest).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>False communications offence</h3>

<p>Under the false communications offence, the following elements would have to be proven in court:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>A defendant sent a message (letter, article or electronic communication) they knew to be false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant intended to cause non-trivial psychological or physical harm to a likely audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The message was sent without any reasonable excuse.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Threatening communications offence</h3>

<p>Under the threatening communications offence, the following elements would have to be proven in court:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>A defendant sent a message which conveyed a threat of serious harm (and serious harm includes serious bodily injury (amounting to grievous bodily harm as understood in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861), rape, assault by penetration and serious financial loss).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In conveying the threat, the defendant intended the object of the threat to fear the threat would be carried out, or the defendant was reckless as to whether the object of the threat would fear that the threat would be carried out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(For threats of serious financial loss, if raised by the defendant) the threat to cause serious financial loss was not used to reinforce a reasonable demand, or the defendant did not reasonably believe that the use of the threat was a proper means of reinforcing the demand.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Annotated case studies</h2>

<h3>Harmful communications offence</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(A) Seriously distressing communications</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A Jewish celebrity, whose grandparents died in a concentration camp, has been raising concerns in the news media about an increase in antisemitic abuse on the streets of London. In response, a Twitter user sent the celebrity a message containing two pictures: one of the celebrity’s grandparents, and a second of a burning cross. This was accompanied with the words “you shouldn’t exist – you won’t exist!”</p>

<p>When the celebrity didn’t respond, the Twitter user sent the celebrity an image of the celebrity’s front door.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>In respect of the first message, it is likely that the Twitter user is guilty of the harmful communications offence.</p>

<p>First, it is clear that there was a real and substantial risk of at least serious distress to the person likely to see the message (ie the celebrity). It is clear that not everyone would be at risk of suffering harm to the requisite degree, but the very personal nature of the message – containing not only antisemitic abuse but abuse directed at the grandparents and the celebrity personally – means that the risk of serious distress was clearly real and substantial. The distress may or may not be long-lasting (though it is arguable that it might be), but it seems likely that it would be profound.</p>

<p>Second, it is clear that serious distress was intended. The Twitter user may argue that they were trying to make a political point, but the targeted and needlessly cruel manner in which they were doing it seems designed to elicit precisely the sort of reaction that was objectively likely. It is for the same reason that the prosecution would not struggle to prove that the message was sent without a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>In respect of the second message, the Twitter user’s guilt is even easier to establish. The message, particularly in the context of the previous message, is clearly threatening in nature (though the threat may not be specific enough to support a charge under the threatening communications offence). This person – who has expressed a wish that the celebrity should not exist – knows where the celebrity lives and evidently desires that the celebrity knows that fact: the intention to cause harm seems unequivocal, and it is clear that there would be a real and substantial risk of serious distress in this circumstance (indeed, the veiled threat may cause not only immediate distress, but also have a significant adverse impact on the celebrity’s day-to-day activities).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that, there having been two messages (ie a “course of conduct”), this could also be prosecuted as harassment under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, although that is a less serious offence than the harmful communications offence (the harassment offence is summary only, whereas the harmful communications offence is an either-way offence). When coming to a charging decision, it is worth bearing in mind that the sender will have likely committed two offences under the more serious harmful comms offence; our position would be that the harmful comms offence would therefore be the more appropriate charge. Nonetheless, if the harm threshold is not met for whatever reason (albeit that it likely would be met in this context), then a harassment charge would be available.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(B) Uncoordinated group harassment</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A young woman on Twitter, J, who follows the MP, sees the harmful message and decides to join in on the ‘pile-on.’ Underneath the MP’s post, J comments “you stupid slut.  She-devils you like you need a good raping… but I wouldn’t want to be the one to do it #Iwouldnotevenrapeyou”.</p>

<p>An up-and-coming, teenage, female tennis player posts a photograph on her Instagram account showing her meeting the MP, with a supportive message underneath. The same young woman from Twitter, J, then sees this photograph and sends to the sportswoman the same message she had sent to the MP.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>These examples demonstrate the importance of context in terms of the application of the harmful communications offence. There has to be a real and substantial risk of at least serious distress. We do not have enough evidence, in either case, to be able to determine this: it would, for example, be far too simplistic to say categorically that an MP would be “used to seeing these messages” and so “less likely to be harmed”. We know, for example, that persistent abuse does not always enable a person to build a “thick skin”, but can have the opposite effect. Nonetheless, factors such as age and experience will have relevance – along with many other contextual factors such as whether the message was sent in the context of a pile-on, which can have a significant adverse impact. So the elements of the offence could be met in both cases: the context of the pile-on would be particularly relevant in the first example, and age and inexperience in the second.</p>

<p>In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, it is very likely that the prosecution would establish that the woman sent the messages without a reasonable excuse. This particular comment was not a genuine contribution to political debate (and nor was it intended to be). It was purely derogatory and contained no reference to the MP’s political position. It would not therefore be covered by free speech protections built into the offence.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(C) Political commentary on transgender issues</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A prominent individual sends a tweet to his followers stating his position of transgender individuals. His message states, ‘I want to make my position on this issue clear, I do not believe that trans individuals are real women.’ He links to a related article about it.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The individual’s tweet wouldn’t be caught under the harmful communications offence.</p>

<p>First, the individual lacked an intention to cause harm – he was simply stating his opinion in relation to the transgender debate. Even if he had foreseen harm (which is far from clear), this does not mean that harm was intended.</p>

<p>The individual may have been aware that groups of individuals may have found his tweet offensive. However, this would not meet the criminal threshold of offence which requires an intention to cause at least serious distress.</p>

<p>Second, even if the message was likely to cause offence, the expression of such views would not meet the legal test(s) of serious distress.</p>

<p>Third, the individual would also have a reasonable excuse for sending the tweet - he was contributing to a well established debate on transgender issues. As a result the prosecution would be unable to prove a lack of a reasonable excuse. This is particularly so given the requirement to consider whether the message was meant as a genuine contribution to a political, albeit controversial, debate – which it clearly was.</p>

<p>As far as the linked article is concerned, this will form part of the message for the purposes of the offence. Without knowing the content of the article, it is hard to say what the effect would be on the potential for harm/intention. Nonetheless, given the context of the accompanying message, and assuming that the article reinforces this message, it seems unlikely that the linked article would change the preceding analysis</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(D) Political commentary on satirical cartoons</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>An individual writes a satirical, political blog, which occasionally includes satirical cartoons. The individual is aware that the cartoon(s) may cause offence to people, but does not intend to cause harm.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The political blog and the cartoon(s) specifically, would not be caught under the harmful communications offence. It is not clear that serious distress is likely or inevitable but, even if it were, foresight of serious distress is not enough. The court would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the individual specifically intended serious distress, and this could not be made out on these facts. In any case, for the avoidance of doubt, the prosecution would also struggle to prove a lack of reasonable excuse, given the importance accorded to political speech. This would therefore not be an offence.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(E) A communication which conveys distressing medical news</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A doctor has a call with a patient on Zoom to provide the results of a biopsy. The doctor explains that the patient has cancer. The doctor is acutely aware of how distressing this news would be.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>It is very clear in this example that the doctor does not intend any distress (let alone serious distress). They also presumably greatly regret the message they are conveying, as the doctor knows that the information carries a real and substantial risk of causing serious distress. This type of communication however is not within the scope of the offence, because it is clear that the intent element of the offence could not be made out.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(F) A communication which conveys a serious sexual assault allegation</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>An employee at a company sends a joke over an employee WhatsApp group (which discusses office matters), about a serious sexual assault allegation. The employee does not realise that one of the group’s members is a survivor of a recent sexual assault, who suffered from post-traumatic distress order.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The communication would not be caught under the offence. The very particular context in which this message was sent means that there was a real and substantial risk of serious distress to a likely audience. However, the employee did not realise this, and did not intend serious distress. Therefore, this is not an offence.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(G) Commentary on political matters - a warzone and specifically, mass graves and executions</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>An independent journalist has been sent detailed pictures of a mass grave and executions in a warzone. The journalist shares these pictures with her former colleagues in order to discuss whether and how to include them in an upcoming blog article.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The communication would not be caught under the offence. It clearly carries a real and substantial risk of serious distress. However, it is clear that the journalist did not intend serious distress. Indeed, she likely regrets the distress that might be caused - even though she may have foreseen that distress as likely. In any case, for the avoidance of doubt, the prosecution would be unable to prove a lack of a reasonable excuse. This is therefore not an offence.</p>
</div>

<h3>False communications offence</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(H) Dangerous COVID-19 cures</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>An individual on Facebook posts a message suggesting that ingesting bleach cures coronavirus. The individual knew that bleach is not a COVID-19 cure and that ingesting it is very dangerous. Later, the individual claims they were influenced by misinformation, through other friends’ news feeds about cures for COVID-19.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The communication would likely be caught under the false communications offence. In this example, the individual knew the message to be false. Further, they clearly intended to cause physical harm to a likely audience (why else send the message if not intending people to follow the “advice”). The defendant also lacked a reasonable excuse for sending the message. While the defendant claimed they were subjected to misinformation, they nonetheless knew the message to be false and that, by sharing the communication, it would cause serious harm.</p>
</div>

<h3>Threatening communications offence</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<h4>(I) COVID-19 NHS staff threat(s)</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>An individual posts a YouTube video in which he suggests that NHS staff at his local hospital should die of coronavirus, “because they deserve it.” He makes a statement that he is going to set fire to the hospital and all inside it “to cleanse my town of these diseased people.”</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The individual would likely be found guilty under the threatening communications offence, in respect of the second statement. The first statement – an offensive “prediction” of what might happen – is not a threat of something to be carried out. This is not true of the second statement, which clearly conveys a threat of at least serious physical harm – if not death – to those in the hospital and also of causing financial loss (to the relevant NHS trust). It is not clear on the evidence whether the individual intended those encountering the message to fear it would be carried out, but at the very least he must have been reckless as to this fact. It is worth bearing in mind that those fearing the threat will be carried out need not be the intended victims of the threatened conduct – it could include NHS staff at the hospital, wider members of the public or family members).</p>

<h4>(J) Financial threat(s)</h4>
</div>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>A woman recently separated from her partner and posted about it on Facebook. The ex-partner sees the post and messages her privately. He posts a public comment falsely suggesting she was dishonest in their relationship and couldn’t control their finances through their shared bank account. The ex-partner and the woman still have the shared account and the ex-partner threatens to withdraw all remaining money from the account, which partly belongs to the woman.</p>

<h4>Worked through example</h4>

<p>The ex-partner would likely be found guilty under the threatening communications offence by threatening to cause serious financial harm. The defendant intended to cause the woman to fear that the threat would be carried out. He would lack a defence as the threat to cause serious financial harm was not used to reinforce a reasonable demand, and neither did the ex-partner believe that the use of the threat was a proper means of reinforcing the demand.</p>
