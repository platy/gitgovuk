<h2>About these statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics are badged as <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/guidance-on-experimental-statistics">experimental statistics</a> and are undergoing development and further assessment of quality. Data is being published to provide insight into how COVID-19 has impacted the social care sector and its response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>These statistics will be assessed regularly and any improvements in quality will be incorporated accordingly at the next available opportunity. The scope of the data included in this publication will also be assessed to ensure the value of these statistics is maintained.</p>

<p>The data in this publication includes the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) publishes monthly statistics on COVID-19 in adult social care settings. This document primarily sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate the statistics. These statistics cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>first, second and booster COVID-19 vaccinations in social care settings for staff and residents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flu vaccinations for the 2021 to 2022 season for social care staff and residents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>infection prevention control (<abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>) measures in place to curb the spread of COVID-19 in care homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staffing levels in care homes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) availability in care homes and domiciliary care settings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>COVID-19 testing for staff, residents and visitors of care homes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data sources and collection</h2>

<p>COVID-19 vaccination, <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr>, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing level data in the publication is taken from management information submitted by care providers in England to a data collection and insight tool called <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.necsu.nhs.uk/capacity-tracker/">Capacity Tracker.</a></p>

<p>Capacity Tracker was originally developed by NHS England and the Better Care Fund to enable the system to better manage hospital discharges by identifying available capacity in care homes. It enables care homes to share their vacancies in real-time, meaning hospital discharge teams and other health professionals can rapidly search availability throughout England.</p>

<p>Capacity Tracker was identified as a suitable tool for COVID-19 data collection from care providers. Its re-purposing was announced via the governmentâs <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan" class="govuk-link">action plan</a> (15 April) and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/bulletins/gd/UKCQC-286ff51">joint letter</a> (17 April) from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) together with the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) and the Care Provider Alliance.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 and flu vaccination</h3>

<p>The Capacity Tracker data collection on first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccination began in December 2020 for care homes, and in February 2021 for independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered domiciliary care providers and for other settings including non-registered providers and local authority employed. Providers self-report their total number of staff and residents and the number of staff and residents who have received the COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

<p>Data collection on booster doses for the COVID-19 vaccine and for flu vaccination for the 2021 to 2022 season began in September 2021.</p>

<p>Prior to September 2021 providers were expected to review and submit the number of individuals who are reported to be vaccinated, reported to be not vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknowns on a daily basis. A vaccination status declared as âunknownâ includes those situations in which the status is not known to the care provider or has not been disclosed. From September 2021, providers are only asked to review and submit the number of individuals who are reported to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>As a result, the rates in this publication refer to the percentage of staff/residents reported to be vaccinated by care providers. This means that the number of individuals who have not received the vaccine cannot be directly derived from data published in these statistics as there is a number of individuals for whom the vaccination status is unknown to the care provider.</p>

<p>Vaccination rates among care home staff vary substantially between those who are directly employed by the care homes and those employed by agencies operating within care homes. This could be due to different uptake rates of the vaccine as well as different proportions of staff whose vaccination status is unknown. Therefore, directly comparing the vaccination rate of directly employed staff to agency staff should be done with caution as the 2 groups are likely to have different percentages of staff whose vaccination status is unknown. Care homes are less likely to know the vaccination status of their agency staff due to the nature of their employment.</p>

<h3>Infection prevention control</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund" class="govuk-link">adult social care Infection Control Fund</a> was first introduced in May 2020. The purpose of this fund is to support adult social care providers, including those with whom the local authority does not have a contract, to reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission within and between care settings, in particular by helping to reduce the need for staff movement between sites.</p>

<p>It was extended in October 2020 and in April 2021 it was consolidated with the existing Rapid Testing Fund, to support additional rapid lateral flow testing of staff in care homes, and enable indoors, close contact visiting where possible. In July the fund was further extended to September 2021 bringing the total funding for infection control to Â£1.5 billion.</p>

<p>In September 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-and-testing-fund-round-3">announced a further extension to the fund</a> with Â£237 million for infection control measures until March 2022.</p>

<p>To support the monitoring of the fund, questions tracking the adult social care sectorâs implementation of the infection control measures are collected. Providers self-report their responses and are expected to submit on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Infection Control Fund">ICF</abbr> provides funding from local authorities to ensure that <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> measures are in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. This publication provides data on how providers are complying with the following measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>limitation of staff movement across different social care settings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accommodating COVID-safe visitation in care homes in line with government guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payment of full wages when staff are isolating due to COVID-19 in care homes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Staffing levels</h3>

<p>To enable providers to meet workforce challenges such as maintaining safe staffing levels over the winter period, on 16 January the government announced an extra Â£120 million <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workforce-capacity-fund-for-adult-social-care/workforce-capacity-fund-for-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">Workforce Capacity Fund</a> to support local authorities to manage workforce pressures.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability</h3>

<p>Data is collected on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability in care homes and domiciliary care providers. Data is collected on the supply of the following items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aprons</li>
  <li>eye protection</li>
  <li>gloves</li>
  <li>hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>face masks</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>This data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics (England): methodology</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-extension-to-infection-control-and-testing-fund-2021">adult social care Rapid Testing Fund</a> was first announced on 23 December 2020 to support the rollout of rapid lateral flow testing in care homes. In April 2021 this was consolidated with the Infection Control Fund, which was then extended to September 2021 to bring the total funding to Â£396 million.</p>

<p>In September 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-and-testing-fund-round-3" class="govuk-link">announced a further extension to the fund</a> of Â£126.3 million for testing costs until March 2022.</p>

<h2>Data coverage</h2>

<p>All data in this publication refers to social care settings in England only.</p>

<p>Data submitted by providers reflects the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Infection prevention control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels</h3>

<p>Data is self-reported by care homes and providers are expected to submit <abbr title="infection prevention control">IPC</abbr> data on a weekly basis while staffing level and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability data is expected to be submitted on a daily basis. Any care home that has not submitted data within the last 7 days is excluded from the relevant analysis for the associated time period where no response was received. The full response rates for all data points are available in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>Infection control data for each reporting week refers to data up to 2pm on the date stated as the âweek endingâ and the 7 days prior. For <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and staffing levels data relates up to 11:59pm on the date stated as the âweek endingâ. The reporting week usually ends on a Tuesday but occasionally no data is available for this date, in these situations the âweek endingâ date will be the nearest available date.</p>

<p>For data relating to the payment of full wages when staff are isolating due to COVID-19 in care homes. For the proportion of care homes paying staff full wages while self-isolating, this relates to care homes which had staff required to self-isolate in the relevant week. This means care homes who had no staff needing to self-isolate will be excluded from the rates for the relevant week.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 and flu vaccination</h3>

<p>Data on booster doses for the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine for the 2021 to 2022 season is now available as part of the November report.</p>

<p>For COVID-19 boosters, statistics are only available for the number of staff and residents who have received their booster dose. Statistics are not yet available on the proportion of staff and residents who have received their booster dose. This is due to ongoing work with <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to align the methodology for calculating booster rates across various groups in the population. These statistics should not be used to estimate the proportion of eligible staff and residents who have received a booster dose.</p>

<p>Data on total number of staff and residents as well as those vaccinated is self-reported by care providers and local authorities. Providers are expected to update their vaccination data on a daily basis. There may be a time lag between individuals receiving the vaccine and the reporting week they are included in the statistics when providers have not provided a recent response. The dates in this section refer to the date vaccinations were reported by care providers as opposed to the date vaccinations were administered.</p>

<p>As of the September report, a time series of response rates is available in the accompanying spreadsheet âCOVID-19 vaccination response rates: data tablesâ for the relevant month. Some care providers have reported the total number of staff or residents but not the numbers vaccinated. As a result of this, vaccination rates are affected by response rates. This is particularly prominent for vaccination rates for second doses in staff employed in other settings and boosters and flu for all staff and resident groups. This is because these groups have a lower response rate and as a result, second dose vaccination rates may be underestimated.</p>

<p>Response rates may also be underestimated, particularly for boosters and flu vaccination. This is because the default value in the underlying data is set to zero, so any zero values submitted will appear to be non-responses.</p>

<p>Data for care homes and domiciliary care relates up to 11:59pm on the day reported as the âweek endingâ. For other settings this relates up to 8:00am on the day reported as the âweek endingâ.</p>

<p>The total number of staff and residents for each social care setting as well as the number vaccinated are self-reported by the care providers and local authorities. As a result, the rates in this publication refer to the percentage of staff or residents reported to be vaccinated by care providers. This means that the number of individuals who have not received the vaccine cannot be directly derived from data published in these statistics as there is a number of individuals for whom the vaccination status is unknown to the care provider.</p>

<p>Older adult care homes are defined as care homes serving any older people (aged 65) as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the âolder peopleâ service user band. Some residents in these care homes may be aged under 65. The remainder of the care homes are classed as younger adult care homes. Staff refers to both those directly employed by the care provider and agency staff.</p>

<p>The total numbers of residents and staff may include individuals who did not receive the vaccine for valid medical reasons or where consent to receive the vaccination was not received.</p>

<p>From the October report onwards, the number of eligible residents and staff, which excluded those who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 28 days is no longer published.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>The number of tests conducted in this report includes care homes staff, residents and visitors tested by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PCR and rapid lateral flow kits sent directly to the care home for regular testing, which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PCR and rapid lateral flow kits conducted at another testing site such as a regional or local test site or a mobile testing unit or tests that were registered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. As individuals can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence or case positivity rates.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted in care home staff also includes staff who additionally work across other care settings such as domiciliary care. It may also include some staff who solely work in another social care setting other than a care home but are unable to be distinguished due to the way occupation is identified in the data.</p>

<p>An update to the methodology was implemented to the testing for COVID-19 in care homes data, from the âAdult social care in England, monthly statistics: July 2021â publication onwards. Prior to that, it included tests where someone had identified their occupation as any of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>care worker or home carer</li>
  <li>residential, day or domiciliary care manager or proprietor</li>
  <li>senior care worker</li>
</ul>

<p>Tests where someone has identified their occupation as one of the above and the test is associated with testing kits sent to domiciliary care providers are now removed from the counts. However, tests where someone has identified their occupation as one of the above but the test is not associated with testing kits sent to domiciliary care providers, have not been excluded.</p>

<p>The time series in the âAdult social care in England, monthly statistics: July 2021â publication and all subsequent publication have been backdated with the new methodology which has resulted in the removal of a substantial number of tests compared to past publications.</p>

<p>This report does not contain data on those tested through pillar 1.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted is reported by type of test and by the individual role (staff, resident, visitor and visiting professional) which is captured when the test is registered. For some tests a limited amount of information is available therefore the individual role cannot be determined. These tests are reported separately in the data tables.</p>

<p>The requirement for care home staff to register negative rapid lateral flow test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive, following a change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff. As a result, a proportion of rapid lateral flow tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.</p>

<h2>Data quality</h2>
<p>This section measures the adult social care statistics against the dimensions of quality set out by the <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/#the-european-statistical-system-s-dimensions-of-quality" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Government Statistical Service for statistical outputs</a>.</p>

<h2>Relevance</h2>
<p>These are monthly statistics by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> of statistics on adult social care in England. This statistical bulletin provides an overview on a range of information on social care settings, with a focus on the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>These statistics are published to provide an overview of how COVID-19 has impacted the adult social care sector and provide transparency on how the care sector is utilising government funds such as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-and-testing-fund-round-3" class="govuk-link">adult social care Infection Control and Testing Fund</a>. This publication aims to improve access to various data on adult social care, especially in relation to COVID-19, by providing a comprehensive, easily accessible bulletin.</p>

<p>These statistics are being badged as experimental statistics while <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> scopes out user and stakeholder needs for these statistics. Feedback from user and stakeholders will be incorporated on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h2>Accuracy and reliability</h2>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 and flu vaccination</h4>

<p>Coverage is limited to care providers registered and providing data to Capacity Tracker. As data is self-reported by care providers for their staff and residents, trends in the data must consider response rates as some care providers report the total number of staff or residents but not the number vaccinated.</p>

<p>Additionally, a proportion of staff and residents will have an unknown vaccination status. This will impact on the deviation from the true value for all care providers. More details can be found in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<p>Response rates may be underestimated, particularly for boosters and exemptions. This is because the default value in Capacity Tracker is set to zero, so any zero values submitted will appear to be non-responses.</p>

<p>The methodology for classifying older and younger adult care homes has been revised for the September report onwards. Prior to September, care homes that are newly active since the publication of the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> care directory were classed as a younger adult care home until the next monthly publication of the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> list, when some may be reclassed as older adult care homes. From September onwards, newly active care homes are classified according to the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data available through their application programming interface (API). This data can be found on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/transparency/using-cqc-data">Using <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data</a>.</p>

<p>The time series in the September report has been backdated with the new methodology. This has had no impact on the vaccination rates but has resulted in minor differences in the number of staff or residents in older and younger adult care homes. As a result, counts for the number of staff or residents in younger adult care homes have been revised downwards by between 0 to 4% for each reporting week while counts for the number of staff or residents in older adult care homes have been revised upwards by less than 1% for each reporting week.</p>

<p>In the October report some data relating to dates before 11 May 2021 has been revised from previous publications due to some instances of implausible data being found. This relates to instances where the counts of staff or residents vaccinated is higher than the number of staff or residents. Implausible data has now been suppressed from the underlying data and removed from aggregated counts and rate calculations.</p>

<p>The time series in the October report has been backdated with the new methodology. The methodology update has resulted in slight changes in terms of counts and vaccination rates for some areas for dates relating to before 11 May 2021.</p>

<p>Validation checks are now implemented by the data supplier to ensure the number of staff or residents vaccinated entered by care providers canât be higher than the number of staff residents.</p>

<h4>Infection control, staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Coverage is limited to care providers registered and providing data to Capacity Tracker. Data is self-reported by care providers and can be influenced by response rates.  More details on response rates can be found in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<p>For the âpayment of care-home staff while self-isolatingâ metric, there may be several care providers who may use a combination of payment options for staff wages. In these situations, providers should report the option they use for the majority of their staff. Questions are not always exhaustive as not all provider circumstances can be considered. Regular work is ongoing to review and adapt questions based on feedback in conjunction with stakeholders.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>Data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service. This report will only include tests which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

<p>The data tables for this publication are produced by a (Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)) using the statistical software âRâ. This reduces the likelihood of certain processing errors by minimising the amount of manual processing or compiling of data. All stages in this pipeline are quality assured by a professional analyst.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>Some processing of the data is completed by an external data engineering team before being received by the analysts compiling these statistics. The department will be evaluating these processes in the coming months and ensuring the quality assurance process is sufficient.</p>

<h2>Timeliness and punctuality</h2>

<p>These statistics are updated on a monthly basis and the data in each publication relates up to 2 weeks prior to the publication date. The lag is to allow time for data to be collected and ensure quality assurances processes can be carried out.</p>

<p>The frequency of these publications will be evaluated while <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> continues to scope out the needs of users and stakeholders.</p>

<p>More timely data on COVID-19 vaccinations and testing in adult social care in England is available through other sources. More details on this can be found in the âdata sources and collectionâ section above.</p>

<h2>Comparability and coherence</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination, Infection Control, staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Data is self-reported from care providers and comparability over time is influenced by response rates. The latest response rates and how they influence the time series can be found in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> also publish data on vaccinations in adult social care settings as part of their broader <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">statistical release on COVID-19 vaccination</a>. The figures in these statistics use the same source and are broadly in line with the <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> figures. More details on the differences can be found in the âother sources of adult social care COVID-19 dataâ section below.</p>

<p>Outputs are also compared against internal analysis carried out by other professional analysts in the department.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>Data is from management information collected during the Test and Trace process. The level of testing and guidance on how frequently those in the adult social care sector should be tested has changed over time and as a result comparison between certain time periods should be made with caution. More information on the testing rollout in care homes is available in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also publishes care home testing data in the weekly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics (England)</a> at national level. Trends in these reports are broadly similar to these statistics and differences can be accounted for by variances in methodology. More details on the differences can be found in the âother sources of adult social care COVID-19 dataâ section below.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and clarity</h2>

<p>These statistics are freely available on the GOV.UK website with all documents published in an accessible format. The statistical reports and âBackground quality and methodologyâ documents are published in HTML and accompanying data tables are published in Open Document Spreadsheet (ODS) format.</p>

<p>This âBackground quality and methodologyâ document is published to ensure users have sufficient information on how these statistics can be used.</p>

<p>The commentary is written with the aim of being clear and impartial. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will continue to scope user and stakeholder needs to ensure the commentary sufficiently meets their needs.</p>

<h2>Cost and burden</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination, infection control, staffing levels and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The burden associated with providing data through Capacity Tracker varies among questions and in line with provider resources. This publication covers different types of questions. Some of these are to be reported daily (COVID-19 vaccinations, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, staffing levels) and some weekly (infection control).</p>

<p>Care providers are expected to provide data regularly to Capacity Tracker as a condition of receiving Infection Control Funding. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-and-testing-fund-round-3">adult social care Infection Control and Testing Fund: round 3</a> for more details.</p>

<p>A high burden on providers to supply data might impact the quality of the data in terms of accuracy, coverage, and consistency. Responses that have been submitted less frequently than weekly are also excluded as part of the analysis for the infection control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and staffing-level data for these statistics.</p>

<p>To improve coverage, the relevance of questions is regularly reviewed in collaboration with care providers and stakeholders and questions which no longer provide value are adjusted or removed.</p>

<h2>Revisions</h2>

<p>Any revisions to past publications will be in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-dhsc/statement-on-revision-policy"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>âs revision policy</a>. Any unscheduled or substantial revisions that do not fit into the scheduled revisions criteria will be highlighted accordingly.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination, infection prevention control, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> availability and staffing levels</h3>

<p>Some data may be collected after the initial publication period and therefore may need to be revised over time.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>Figures are routinely revised each month. Some data may be collected after the initial publication period and therefore may need to be revised over time.</p>

<h2>Other sources of adult social care COVID-19 data</h2>

<p>These statistics are being published as a part of a wider landscape of statistics on adult social care. The Government Statistical Service (GSS) compiles a <a rel="external" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/dashboard/tools/adult-social-care-statistics/database.html" class="govuk-link">UK adult social care database</a> of official statistics on adult social care across the 4 nations of the UK. This is updated on a monthly basis.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccinations</h3>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> also publish data on vaccinations in adult social care settings as part of their broader <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/" class="govuk-link">statistical release on COVID-19 vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>Both publications follow the same methodology and use the same data source but there are some differences, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reporting period, data in this publication reports data collected up to 11:59pm on a Tuesday whereas <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use data collected up to 11:59pm on a Sunday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a small amount of data may be collected after the respective reporting periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>regional breakdowns, data in this publication uses the administrative regions of England and <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> use NHS regions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also publishes care home testing data in the weekly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports">NHS Test and Trace statistics</a> (England) at national level. This publication uses the same data source but has a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes. Differences in the figures will occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>differences in which tests from different routes are included. Both methodologies include the number of tests registered from kits sent directly to care homes, but this publication additionally includes care home staff or residents tested via other routes such as regional or local test sites. As a result, figures in this report will be substantially higher for PCR tests conducted in care home staff due to the current guidance recommending staff with symptoms to be tested outside of the care home (see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> for more information)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different reporting periods. This publication uses the start time of the test in comparison to the Test and Trace statistics which use the date on which the test result was received by the individual taking the test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>different times of extracting the data</p>
  </li>
</ul>
