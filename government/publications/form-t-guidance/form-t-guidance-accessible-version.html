<p>Registration as a British citizen – A guide for 
those born in the UK on or after 1 January 
1983 who have lived in the UK up to the age 
of 10</p>

<p>March 2019</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Becoming a British citizen is a significant life event. Apart from allowing you to apply 
for a British citizen passport, British citizenship gives you the opportunity to 
participate more fully in the life of your local community.</p>

<p>For your application to succeed you will need to show that you satisfy a number of 
requirements that are set out in British nationality law. This guide aims to help you to 
make a successful application. It will also help you to prepare for British citizenship. 
It tells you what information to provide and which documents you need to supply.</p>

<p>The first chapter of this guide summarises the legal requirements for applying for 
registration.</p>

<p>You should be aware that under the nationality laws of some countries a person will 
automatically lose their nationality if they become a citizen of another country. If you 
have any questions about this, you should ask the authorities of the country of which 
you are a citizen through their embassy or high commission before making your 
application. If the country of which you are currently a citizen continues to recognise 
you as one of its citizens, you may continue to be subject to the duties of citizens of 
that country when you are in its territory. This may include obligations to undergo 
military service.</p>

<p>The law covering registration is contained in the British Nationality Act 1981 and the 
Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, and the regulations made under them. 
This guide is intended to help you to apply. It is not a complete statement of the law 
or policy. Other information about <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">citizenship and immigration</a> is available on our 
website.</p>

<h2>The requirements you have to meet</h2>

<p>To be registered under this section you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been born in the UK on or after 1 January 1983</li>
  <li>be 10 years of age or over</li>
  <li>have spent no more than 90 days outside the UK in each of the first 10 years of 
your life</li>
  <li>be of good character</li>
</ul>

<p>In special circumstances, the Home Secretary may make an exception to the 
requirement that the applicant must not have been absent from the UK for more than 
90 days in any of the first 10 years. If you have exceeded this number of days in any 
of those years, but you believe there are special circumstances in your case, you 
should explain what those special circumstances are on a separate sheet of paper.</p>

<p>An application may be made by an adult or a child, but if the applicant is under 18 
the form should normally be filled in by their parent or guardian (giving the child‘s 
particulars).</p>

<p>A child who is unable to meet some of, or all of, the requirements listed above may 
still have a right to be registered as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/british-citizenship">British citizen</a> on the strength of their parents’ 
citizenship or immigration status. Alternatively, the Home Secretary may be prepared 
to register a child because of his or her special circumstances. You can obtain 
further advice on our website.</p>

<p>If one of your parents was a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/british-citizenship">British citizen</a> or was settled in the UK at the time of 
your birth, you are already a British citizen and there is no need to apply for 
registration. The definition of ‘parent’ here will depend on the date of the child’s birth. 
Further information can be found on our website.</p>

<p>A parent will have been ‘settled’ in the UK if they were ordinarily resident there 
without being subject to any time limit under the immigration rules. A person is not 
‘settled’ if he or she is in the UK either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in breach of the immigration laws</li>
  <li>as a member of a diplomatic mission, visiting forces or (with some exceptions) 
an international organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK means England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and 
the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>Information you give will be treated in confidence, but may be disclosed to 
Government Departments, the Security Service and other agencies, local authorities 
and the police, where it is necessary for immigration or nationality purposes or to 
enable these bodies to carry out their own function.</p>

<p>If you do not meet the requirements but think the Home Secretary should exercise 
discretion in your favour you should provide details of the special circumstances in 
your case. If you do not provide any details or if your special circumstances are not 
accepted your application will be refused and your fee will not be fully refunded. 
Applications that fail generally do so because either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applicants do not tell us about offences and convictions</li>
  <li>the residence requirements have not been satisfied</li>
</ul>

<h3>OISC and Immigration Advice</h3>

<p>Immigration or nationality advisers acting in the course of business (whether paid or 
unpaid) are regulated by the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner 
(OISC), an independent body. The provision of such advice is prohibited unless a 
person works for an organisation registered with, or exempted by, the OISC or is 
authorised to practice (like solicitors and barristers) by a designated professional 
body.</p>

<p>A full list of OISC regulated advisers is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-immigration-services-commissioner">OISC website</a>.</p>

<h3>Residence requirements</h3>

<p>To satisfy the residence requirements you should not have been absent for more 
than 90 days in each of the first 10 years of your life.</p>

<p>There is discretion to disregard absences in excess of the limits. We will normally 
waive excess absences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the number of days absence from the UK in any one of those years does not 
exceed 180 days, and the total number of days absence over the 10-year 
period does not exceed 990 days</li>
  <li>(if the number of days absence exceeds 180 in any one year or 990 over the 
10year period) the excess absence was the result of circumstances beyond 
your control (such as serious illness)</li>
</ul>

<p>We would not normally waive excess absences simply because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your parents were unaware of the requirements</li>
  <li>your parents’ absences, with you, were entirely voluntary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Good character</h3>

<p>To be of good character you should have shown respect for the rights and freedoms 
of the UK, observe its laws and fulfilled your duties and obligations as a resident of 
the UK. Checks will be carried out to ensure that the information you give is correct.</p>

<p>If you are not honest about the information you provide, and you are registered on 
the basis of incorrect or fraudulent information you will be liable to have British 
citizenship taken away (deprivation) and you may be prosecuted. It is a criminal 
offence to make a false declaration knowing that it is untrue.</p>

<p>Among the duties and obligations which you are expected to fulfil is payment of 
income tax and National Insurance contributions. We may ask H.M. Revenue &amp; 
Customs for confirmation that your tax and National Insurance affairs are in order.</p>

<p>If you do not pay income tax through PAYE you must demonstrate that you have 
discharged your obligations towards the H.M. Revenue &amp; Customs, by attaching a 
Self Assessment Statement of Account.</p>

<p>You must give details of all criminal convictions both within and outside the UK. 
These include road traffic offences.</p>

<p>Fixed penalty notices (such as speeding or parking tickets) must be disclosed, 
although will not normally be taken into account unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have failed to pay and there were criminal proceedings as a result</li>
  <li>you received 3 or more fixed penalty notices at any level</li>
  <li>in the past 3 years you received 2 or more fixed penalty notices, at least one 
of which was at the upper levels (fine of £200 or more).</li>
</ul>

<p>We will consider the applications against the factors listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-character-nationality-policy-guidance">Good Character 
Guidance</a> at considering cumulative, non-custodial sentences.</p>

<p>Where a fixed penalty notice or fiscal fine has been referred to a court due to non-payment, or the notice has been unsuccessfully challenged by the person in court, 
we will consider it as a conviction and assess it in line with the new sentence 
imposed.</p>

<p>Drink driving offences must be declared. If you have any endorsements on your 
driving licence you must provide the paper counterpart.</p>

<p>A driving conviction may not be disregarded despite any penalty points being 
removed from your driving licence.</p>

<p>Criminal record checks will be carried out in all cases. If you have a conviction within 
the relevant sentence based threshold you are unlikely to be registered as a British 
citizen. Similarly, if you have been charged with a criminal offence and are awaiting 
trial or sentencing, you are advised not to make any application for registration until 
the outcome is known. If you are convicted, you should then consult the table below.</p>

<h4>4 Years or more imprisonment</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused, 
regardless of when the conviction 
occurred.</p>

<h4>Between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused 
unless 15 years have passed since 
the end of the sentence.</p>

<h4>Up to 12 months imprisonment</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused 
unless 10 years have passed since 
the end of the sentence.</p>

<h4>A non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a person’s criminal record</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused if 
the conviction occurred in the last 3 
years.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A person who receives a sentence of life imprisonment is included in the ‘4 
years or more imprisonment’ category.</li>
  <li>A person who receives a custodial sentence of exactly 4 years is included in 
the ‘4 years or more imprisonment’ category.</li>
  <li>A person who receives a custodial sentence of exactly 12 months or exactly 1 
year is included in the ‘Between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment’ 
category.</li>
  <li>The “end of the sentence” means the entire sentence imposed, not just the time 
the person spent in prison. For example, a person sentenced to 3 years’ 
imprisonment on 1/1/2013 will normally be refused citizenship until 1/1/2031 –
the 15 year ‘bar’ added to the 3 year sentence.</li>
  <li>A “non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a 
person’s criminal record” includes Fines, Cautions, Warnings and Reprimands, 
Community Sentences, Civil Orders, Hospital Orders &amp; Restriction Orders and 
Potential Court Orders.</li>
  <li>A person who is subject of an extant Deportation Order will be refused 
citizenship regardless of when they apply.</li>
  <li>Some extremely short periods of imprisonment may not be included in the ‘up 
to 12 months imprisonment’ category. This will depend on whether the person 
was convicted &amp; sentenced or simply committed to prison. The latter is not a 
sentence and the vast majority of those detained for one day– will have been 
committed by the court and not sentenced. The decision maker will instead 
treat this as a “non- custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is 
recorded on a person’s criminal record”.</li>
  <li>A suspended prison sentence will be treated as a “non-custodial offence or 
other out of court disposal that is recorded on a person’s criminal record”.</li>
  <li>The exception is where that sentence is subsequently ‘activated’. This means 
that the person re-offended or failed to adhere to/breached the conditions of 
that sentence. Where this happens, the sentence length will be the one 
originally imposed.
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: a person is sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 
two years. If they ‘activate’ this, the sentence should be 6 months and fall into 
the ‘up to 12 months’ imprisonment’ category above.</li>
      <li>Example 2: a person is sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 
two years. If they ‘activate’ this, the sentence should be 12 months and fall into 
the ‘Between 12 months and 4 years’ imprisonment’ category above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sentences imposed overseas will normally be treated as if they occurred in the 
UK.</li>
  <li>For concurrent sentences, the decision maker will take the longest single 
sentence imposed. For example, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment served 
concurrently with a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment will be treated the 
same as one 9-month sentence.</li>
  <li>For consecutive sentences, the decision maker will add together the total of all 
the sentences imposed. For example, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment 
served consecutively with a of 6 months’ imprisonment will be treated the same 
as one 15month sentence.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are also advised to refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-character-nationality-policy-guidance">good character policy guidance</a> which 
caseworkers use to decide your application.</p>

<p>You must give details of all civil judgments which have resulted in a court order 
being made against you as well as any civil penalties under the UK Immigration 
Acts. If you have been declared bankrupt at any time you should give details of the 
bankruptcy proceedings. (Your application is unlikely to succeed if you are an 
undischarged bankrupt).</p>

<p>You do not need to give details of family law proceedings such as divorce decrees, 
dissolved civil partnerships, guardianship orders, parental responsibility orders.</p>

<p>You must give details of any cautions (simple or conditional), warnings or 
reprimands you have received in the UK or any other country. Cautions, warnings 
and reprimands are out of court disposals that are recorded on a person’s criminal 
record and are taken in to account when assessing a person’s character.</p>

<p>You must say if your details have been recorded by the police as a result of certain 
sexual offences, or if you are subject to one of the following orders: notification 
order, sexual offences prevention order, foreign travel order, risk of sexual harm 
order (or equivalent order made in a British overseas territory or any other country). 
If your details are recorded on the “sex offenders” register, even if any conviction is 
spent, the Home Secretary is unlikely to be satisfied that you meet the good 
character requirement and so an application for citizenship is unlikely to be 
successful.</p>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which you may go to court or which is 
awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and 
waiting to hear if you will be formally charged. If you have been arrested and not 
told that charges have been dropped, or that you will not have to appear in court, 
you may wish to confirm the position with the police. For applicants from Scotland 
any recent civil penalties must also be declared. You must tell us if you are 
arrested or charged with an offence after you make your application and while the 
application is under consideration. You risk prosecution under section 46 of the 
British Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<p>You must also say whether you have had any involvement in terrorism. If you do 
not regard something as an act of terrorism but you know that others do or might, 
you should mention it. You must also say whether you have been involved in any 
crimes in the course of armed conflict, including crimes against humanity, war 
crimes or genocide. If you are in any doubt as to whether something should be 
mentioned, you should mention it.</p>

<p>You should refer to the definitions in this Guide on actions which may constitute 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>

<p>This guidance is not exhaustive. Before you answer these questions you should 
consider the full definitions of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide 
which can be found in Schedule 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">International Criminal Court Act 2001</a>.
Alternatively, copies can be purchased from The Stationery Office, telephone 0870 
600 5522.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that you are familiar with the definitions 
and can answer the questions accurately.</p>

<h4>Genocide</h4>

<p>Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial 
or religious group.</p>

<h4>Crimes against humanity</h4>

<p>Acts committed at any time (not just during armed conflict) as part of a widespread 
or systematic attack, directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the 
attack. This would include offences such as murder, torture, rape, severe deprivation 
of liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law and enforced 
disappearance of persons.</p>

<h4>War Crimes</h4>

<p>Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions committed during an armed conflict. 
This includes an internal armed conflict and an international armed conflict. The 
types of acts that may constitute a war crime include wilful killing, torture, extensive 
destruction of property not justified by military necessity, unlawful deportation, the 
intentional targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages.</p>

<h4>Terrorist Activities</h4>

<p>Any act committed, or the threat of action, designed to influence a government or 
intimidate the public and made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or 
ideological cause and that involves serious violence against a person; that may 
endanger another person’s life; creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the 
public; involves serious damage to property; is designed to seriously disrupt or 
interfere with an electronic system.</p>

<h4>Organisations concerned in terrorism</h4>

<p>An organisation is concerned in terrorism if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commits or participates in acts of terrorism,</li>
  <li>prepares for terrorism,</li>
  <li>promotes or encourages terrorism (including the unlawful glorification of 
terrorism), or</li>
  <li>is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deception</h4>

<p>If you have practised deception in your dealings with the Home Office or other 
Government Departments (such as by providing false information or fraudulent 
documents) this will be taken in to account in considering whether you meet the 
good character requirement.</p>

<p>Your application will be refused if you have attempted to deceive the Home Office 
within the last 10 years.</p>

<h4>Immigration Related Issues</h4>

<p>Your application may also be refused if you have evaded immigration control in the 
last 10 years or helped someone else to evade immigration control or employed 
illegal workers, at any time. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/naturalisation-as-a-british-citizen-by-discretion-nationality-policy-guidance">Full details of our policy</a> can be seen on the website.</p>

<h4>Deprivation</h4>

<p>You may be deprived of your British citizenship if it is found to have been obtained by 
fraud, false representation or the concealment of any material fact. The Home 
Secretary may also deprive you of British citizenship if they are satisfied that 
deprivation is conducive to the public good and you would not be made stateless. 
Following the Immigration Act 2014, the Home Secretary may also deprive naturalised 
persons of their British citizenship if the person has conducted themselves in a 
manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom and 
the Home Secretary has reasonable grounds for believing the person is able, under 
the law of another country to become a national of that country or territory.</p>

<h4>What if you haven’t been convicted but your character may be in doubt?</h4>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which you may go to court or which is 
awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and 
waiting to hear if you will be formally charged. If you have been arrested and not told 
that charges have been dropped, or that you will not have to appear in court, you 
may wish to confirm the position with the police. You must tell us if you are arrested 
or charged with an offence after you make your application and while the application 
is under consideration. You risk prosecution under section 46 of the British 
Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<p>You must say whether you have been involved in anything which might indicate that 
you are not of good character. You must give information about any of these 
activities no matter how long ago this was. Checks will be made in all cases and your 
application may fail and your fee will not be fully refunded if you make an untruthful 
declaration. If you are in any doubt about whether you have done something or it has 
been alleged that you have done something which might lead us to think that you are 
not of good character you should say so.</p>

<h2>Biometric enrolment</h2>

<p>As part of your application, all applicants are required to enrol their biometric details 
for the purpose of identity verification.</p>

<p>Children under 18 applying for registration as a British citizen must also enrol their 
biometric details. Children under the age of 6 do not need to provide fingerprints, but 
must have a digital photograph taken of their face.</p>

<p>The requirement for fingerprints to be taken from the age of 6 comes from EU 
Regulation 380/2008. Up to the age of 6 the Home Office only requires a digitised 
image of the child’s face, although the regulation does not prevent fingerprints being 
recorded from children aged less than 6 years. There is no upper age limit for 
biometric information to be taken.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at 
their biometric enrolment appointment.</p>

<p>You must complete the biometric enrolment section of the application, and you will 
then be issued with an enrolment letter, instructing you to make an appointment at a 
designated Post Office to have your/your child’s biometric details recorded.</p>

<p>You will be charged an additional handling fee for this service, payable to the Post 
Office Ltd. You must pay the fee by cash or debit card when you attend your 
biometric enrolment appointment.</p>

<p>If you are currently in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man you/your child would 
enrol at the Lieutenant Governor’s Office.</p>

<p>If you are currently in a British overseas territory you/your child would enrol at the 
Governor’s Office.</p>

<p>Your application may be rejected as invalid if you do not enrol your biometrics when 
requested. For more information about enrolling biometrics and the current fee, 
please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits">biometric residence permits</a> section of our website.</p>

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>This section tells you the sort of documents you will need to send for.
You must send:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your/your child’s full UK birth certificate (showing the parents’ details).</li>
  <li>evidence of residence in the UK for the first 10 years of your/your child’s life. If 
you are self-employed and do not pay tax through Pay As You Earn (PAYE) 
arrangements, we require your most recent H.M. Revenue &amp; Customs SelfAssessment statement of account.</li>
  <li>your/your child’s passport(s) which cover the 10-year period. As the passport(s) 
may not be enough to show residence in the UK throughout the 10-year period, 
you should send as much as you can of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>letters from schools or other educational establishments which you/your child 
attended during that period</li>
      <li>medical records (child health book, summary of appointments from your/your 
child’s GP, nursery records) particularly where these assist in demonstrating 
residence in the years before attending school</li>
      <li>any other documents showing that you/your child lived in the United 
Kingdom for the first 10 years of your/their life.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Citizenship ceremonies</h2>

<p>If your application is successful and you are living in the UK, you will be invited to 
attend a citizenship ceremony if you are over 18. You will receive an invitation letter 
from the Home Office and this will confirm the local authority you should contact to 
arrange your ceremony. We expect you to arrange to attend a ceremony within 3 
months of receiving your invitation otherwise it will expire and you will have to re-apply for registration and pay a further processing fee.</p>

<p>If you are over the age of 18 when your application is decided, you will need to
attend a citizenship ceremony. At the ceremony, you will be asked to affirm or swear 
an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and to pledge your loyalty to the UK. 
Following this you will be presented with your certificate of registration as a British 
citizen.</p>

<p>You must make immediate contact with the local authority once you have been 
informed that your application is successful, as you only have 90 days in which to 
attend the ceremony. The date by which you must attend your ceremony will be 
given in your Home Office citizenship ceremony invitation letter. If you do not attend 
the ceremony within 90 days without good reason, your application for citizenship will 
be refused and you will need to re-apply.</p>

<p>Making the Oath (or Affirmation) and Pledge at a citizenship ceremony is a legal 
requirement for adults, and the point at which you will become a British citizen. You 
are therefore expected to attend a ceremony. If you have special needs or concerns 
about saying the Oath (or Affirmation) and Pledge in English, you should bring these 
to the attention of the local authority once you have your invitation letter.</p>
