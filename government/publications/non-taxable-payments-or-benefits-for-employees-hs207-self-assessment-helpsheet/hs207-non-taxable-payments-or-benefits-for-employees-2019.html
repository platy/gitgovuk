<h2>Payments by your employer towards additional household costs where you work at home</h2>
<p>Payments made to you by your employer for your reasonable additional household costs if you work at home regularly, are exempt from tax and you do not need to enter them on your tax return. You need to work at home by agreement with your employer instead of working on their premises. The exemption does not apply if you simply take additional work home in the evenings. Your employer may pay you up to £4 a week without you needing to keep supporting evidence of the cost. They can pay more where your costs are greater, provided you keep supporting evidence to show that the payment is wholly for additional household expenses incurred in working at home or where your employer has agreed a figure with us.</p>

<h2>Incidental overnight expenses</h2>
<p>Payments that your employer makes for personal expenditure, up to certain limits, when you stay away from home for at least one night during a business journey. The maximum amounts that may be paid without any tax consequences are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£5 a night for each night away during business journeys anywhere in the UK (Great Britain and Northern Ireland)</li>

<p>Where a director’s spouse or partner accompanies the director on a business trip abroad because the director’s health is so precarious that the director could not undertake the foreign travel alone, the expenses borne by the employer for the spouse’s or partner’s travel on that journey. The same principle applies to employees as it does for directors.</p>

<p>In all cases, travel expenses include reasonable hotel expenses necessarily incurred.</p>

<h2>Travelling expenses of group company employees</h2>
<p>Where an employee has employments with 2 or more companies that are part of the same group of companies, any journey made between the places at which the duties of those employments are carried out is a business journey.</p>

<ul>

  <li>there’s no other private use of the car</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have not left by the time you start the course, you must leave within 2 years of finishing it for the exemption to apply. The exemption is withdrawn if you’re re-employed by the same employer in the 2 years following the end of the course. (The employer must tell us within 60 days of this happening.)</p>

<p>Exemption is only available if you’ve been employed by your employer for at least 2 years up to the time you begin the course (or at the time the employment ceased).</p>

<p>Courses must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teach or improve skills which will help you to find new work (and be entirely devoted to those objectives)</li>
  <li>last no more than 2 years</li>

  <li>employee development schemes</li>
  <li>activities intended to develop skills you need in leadership and teamwork, for example, Raleigh International</li>

<p>The tax exemption also covers:</p>

  <li>other incidental costs, such as additional childcare expenses directly related to you undertaking the training in question</li>
  <li>costs which relate to examinations and registration of qualifications</li>
  <li>the costs of multi-media and distance-learning aids, practical course materials and books</li>
</ul>

<p>Training, or training-related travel and subsistence, which is provided as entertainment, recreation, reward or an inducement, remains taxable. Any asset provided to you or for your use is also taxable unless the asset is provided or used purely for training, or for training coupled only with use in the performance of the duties of your office or employment. Assets provided for private use remain chargeable in the normal way.</p>

  <li>the suggestion must relate to the activities carried on by your employer</li>
  <li>the suggestion for which the award is made is outside the scope of your normal duties – the test is that, taking account of your experience, you could not reasonably have been expected to put forward such a suggestion as part of the duties of your post</li>
  <li>the suggestion was not made at a meeting held for the purpose of proposing suggestions</li>
</ul>

<p>The exemption applies to 2 types of awards for suggestions encouragement awards and financial benefit awards.</p>

<h2>Encouragement awards</h2>
<p>An encouragement award is one that’s made for a suggestion which has some special merit or reflects praiseworthy effort on the part of the person making the suggestion. The permitted maximum for an encouragement award is £25. If the encouragement award exceeds £25 the excess over £25 is taxable.</p>

<h2>Financial benefit awards</h2>
<p>There are additional conditions which apply to financial awards.</p>

<p>Awards are only made following a decision to implement the suggestion.</p>

<p>The decision to make an award is based on the degree of improvement in efficiency or effectiveness likely to be achieved. This is measured by the prospective financial benefits and the period over which they would accrue the importance of the subject matter having regard to the nature of the employer’s business.</p>

<p>The amount of the award does not exceed 50% of the expected net financial benefit during the first year of implementation 10% of the expected net financial benefit over a period of up to 5 years subject, in each case, to an overriding maximum of £5,000 – where an award exceeds £5,000, the excess over that figure is taxable.</p>

<p>If 2 or more employees receive an award in respect of the same suggestion, the exempt amount is divided between them in the same proportion as their individual awards bear to the total sum awarded.</p>
