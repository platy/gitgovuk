<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Health and wellbeing boards (<abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>) have been a key mechanism for driving joined-up working at a local level since they were established in 2013.</p>

<p>Since then, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/31/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Care Act 2022</a> has introduced new architecture to the health and care system, specifically the establishment of integrated care boards (<abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>) and integrated care partnerships (<abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr>). In this new landscape, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> continue to play an important role in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>instilling mechanisms for joint working across health and care organisations</li>
  <li>setting strategic direction to improve the health and wellbeing of people locally</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department for Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) will therefore be updating the guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/health-and-wellbeing-board-duties"><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> general duties and powers</a> to provide information on how <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> currently work and clarify their role within the system – including working with <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This engagement document therefore contains draft guidance and a series of engagement questions. We welcome responses to these questions to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shape the guidance</li>
  <li>provide practical examples of the roles and ways of working of <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This draft guidance on <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> has been updated to align with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/31/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Care Act 2022</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-integration-joining-up-care-for-people-places-and-populations">Health and social care integration: joining up care for people, places and populations</a> white paper (published February 2022).</p>

<p>It provides:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Background and context for this draft guidance.</li>
  <li>Information on how <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> currently work.</li>
  <li>Clarification about their role post-1 July 2022, and the respective roles and duties of <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and how they work in partnership with other <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This guidance should support <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> leaders to understand how they should work with <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> to ensure effective system and place-based working, without being constrained or influenced by hierarchical approaches.</p>

<p>It also complements established guidance and signposts to other relevant new guidance.</p>

<h2>Background and context</h2>

<p>Promoting integrated person-centred care and health promotion is a key objective of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform-white-paper">adult social care reform vision</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/31/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Care Act 2022</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS Long Term Plan</a>
</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s integration white paper <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-integration-joining-up-care-for-people-places-and-populations">Health and social care integration: joining up care for people, places and populations</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a strong focus on establishing a sense of place</li>
  <li>instil a mechanism for joint working and improving wellbeing of their local population</li>
  <li>set strategic direction to improve health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Social Care Act 2012</a> introduced <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>, which became operational on 1 April 2013 in all 152 local authorities with social care and public health responsibilities.</p>

<p>Since then, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/31/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Care Act 2022</a>, which received Royal Assent in April 2022, looks to enable greater integration between partners across the health (which includes physical and mental health) and social care sector. This includes collaboration between partners who can address the wider determinants of health by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removing barriers to data-sharing</li>
  <li>enabling joint decision-making and greater collaboration within the NHS, between trusts, and between the NHS and other systems partners – in particular local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>The new architecture, introduced by the Health and Care Act 2022, and guidance on establishing place-based arrangements are based on the principle of subsidiarity.</p>

<p>The Health and Care Act 2022 establishes new NHS bodies known as <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and requires the creation of <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> in each local system area. This will empower local health and care leaders to join up planning and provision of services – both within the NHS and with local authorities – and help deliver more person-centred and preventative care.</p>

<p>Local authorities understand the needs and concerns of their local populations. They bring a wider perspective that extends beyond the NHS, and have the ability to act on social, economic and environmental factors that influence people’s health and wellbeing. Local authorities are core members of the systems and have a clear role in the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>. As leaders of place, they will have an essential role with the NHS to plan and deliver integrated care services.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-integration-joining-up-care-for-people-places-and-populations">integration white paper</a> sets out actions the government will take to support this greater collaboration at place level, and further develop the effective delivery of integrated health and care services.</p>

<p>It sets an expectation that places will make rapid progress in providing clarity on the governance and scope of their place-based arrangements to ensure NHS and local authority leadership are effectively bought together. This will include a single person, accountable for the delivery of shared outcomes and plans in each place, working with local partners.</p>

<p>Recognising the need for different approaches to meet the needs of different people, places will be able to decide which model of governance they adopt in line with the criteria. In some places, the single accountable person could – but does not need to be – a representative from the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>. However, we expect all place-based arrangements to build on and work with existing forums such as <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> as key existing place-based partnerships for driving integration.</p>

<p>This document therefore provides updated guidance on <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> to align with the Health and Care Act 2022 and integration white paper, which we will engage further on before final publication.</p>

<h2>Role and purpose of health and wellbeing boards</h2>

<p>Decisions affecting planning, commissioning, operational co-ordination, and the use of resources in the health and care system will happen across a number of forums including <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Each local authority (including London boroughs) is required to establish a <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>, which must consist of certain persons as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/section/194" rel="external">section 194 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012</a> including a representative from each relevant <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>.</p>

<p>The joint local health and wellbeing strategy (<abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>) should directly inform the development of joint commissioning arrangements<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> in the local area, and the co-ordination of NHS and local authority commissioning, including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/part-rel/transformation-fund/better-care-fund/" rel="external">Better Care Fund</a> plans.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> remain a committee of the local authority, and provide a forum where political, clinical, professional and community leaders from across the care and health system come together to improve the health and wellbeing of their local population, and look to reduce health inequalities.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Along with other leaders at place, it will continue to lead action to improve people’s lives at place level in many areas, and remain responsible for promoting greater integration and partnership between the NHS, public health and local government.</p>

<p>The functions of a local authority and its partner <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> under sections <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/28/section/116" rel="external">116</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/28/section/116A" rel="external">116A of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007</a> are to be exercised by the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> established by the local authority.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> can and do – at their discretion – invite other organisations to join the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>, including, for example, organisations from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the voluntary, community and social enterprise (<abbr title="voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr>) sector</li>
  <li>children’s and adult social care</li>
  <li>healthcare providers</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> can therefore be the forum for discussions about strategic and operational co-ordination in the delivery of services already commissioned.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> continue to be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessing the health and wellbeing needs of the area and publishing a joint strategic needs assessment (<abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>publishing a <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> that:
    <ul>
      <li>sets out the priorities for improving the health and wellbeing of its local population, and how the assessed needs will be addressed – including addressing health inequalities</li>
      <li>reflects the evidence of the <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Health and Care Act 2022 has not fundamentally changed the required members of a <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/health-and-wellbeing-board-duties">core statutory membership</a> of an <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> is unchanged, other than requiring a representative from <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>, rather than clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>Each <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> also has a separate statutory duty<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> to develop a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pharmaceutical-needs-assessments-information-pack">pharmaceutical needs assessment (<abbr title="pharmaceutical needs assessment">PNA</abbr>) for their area for which a separate guidance is available</a>. A <abbr title="pharmaceutical needs assessment">PNA</abbr> cannot be subsumed as part of a <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>, but can be annexed to them.</p>

<h3>Joint strategic needs assessments (<abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr>) and joint local health and wellbeing strategies (<abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsnas-and-jhws-statutory-guidance">statutory guidance explaining the duties and powers in relation to <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr></a> is unchanged. As part of our engagement, we will gather the information required to update this guidance.</p>

<p><abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr> are the vehicles for ensuring that the needs, and the local determinants of health of the local population are identified and agreed. The <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr> provides the evidence base for the health and wellbeing needs of the local population and should be kept up to date.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> The <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> sets out the agreed priorities and joint action for partners to address the health and wellbeing needs identified by the <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr>. They are not an end in themselves, but a regular process of strategic assessment and planning.</p>

<p>Local authorities and <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> must have regard to the relevant <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr> so far as it is relevant when exercising their functions.</p>

<p>NHS England must also – in exercising any functions in arranging for the provision of health services in relation to the area of a responsible local authority – have regard to the relevant <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Joint strategic needs assessments (<abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr>)</h4>

<p>In developing <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr>, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> may consult any person it thinks appropriate. They should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>look to involve the local community and representative organisations</li>
  <li>consider a broad range of issues across all demographics – this includes the:
    <ul>
      <li>needs of disadvantaged or vulnerable groups such as inclusion health<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>
</li>
      <li>wider social, environmental and economic factors that might impact on health and wellbeing<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> should also be informed by research, evidence, local insight and intelligence, as well as more detailed local needs assessments such as at a district or ward level.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> The integrated care strategy produced by the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> will also be informed by research to ensure alignment. <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> should also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider where there is a lack of such evidence</li>
  <li>identify research needs in <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> that could be met by <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>, local authorities and NHS England via the exercise of their research functions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Joint local health and wellbeing strategies (<abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Joint health and wellbeing strategies have been known as joint local health and wellbeing strategies (<abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr>) since 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> receives an integrated care strategy from the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>, they do not need to refresh <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr> if they consider that the existing <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> is sufficient.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> sets out the vision, priorities and actions agreed by the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the needs identified within the <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>improve the health, care and wellbeing of local communities, and reduce health inequalities.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> will need to consider the integrated care strategies when preparing their own <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> to ensure that they are complementary. Conversely, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> should be active participants in the development of the integrated care strategy as guidance on the content of the integrated care strategy may also be useful for <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> to consider in the development of their <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> is for the footprint of the local authority (with children’s and adult social care, and public health responsibilities). The integrated care strategy should build on and complement these place-based strategies, identifying where needs could be better addressed at the system footprint. It should also bring in learning from across the system to drive improvement and innovation.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The introduction of integrated care strategies is an opportunity for JSNAs and JLHWSs to be revised and/or refreshed to ensure that they remain effective tools for decision-making at both place and system levels. This includes maximising the opportunities of digitalising the JSNA and improving its accessibility for a range of users.</p>
</div>

<p>Examples of both <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> development in practice can be found in the Local Government Association (<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>) document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/what-difference-place-makes-growing-impact-health-and-wellbeing-boards" rel="external">What a difference a place makes: the growing impact of health and wellbeing boards</a>.</p>

<h2>The relationship between <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>: continuity and change</h2>

<p>As a minimum, we expect all partners – the <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> – to adopt a set of principles in developing relationships, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building from the bottom up</li>
  <li>following the principles of subsidiarity</li>
  <li>having clear governance</li>
  <li>ensuring that leadership is collaborative</li>
  <li>avoiding duplication of existing governance mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> leaders within local systems, informed by the people in their local communities, need to build on the work of <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>. They should ensure that action at system-wide level adds value to the action at place level, so they are all aligned in understanding what is best for their population. In an effective health and care system, the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> should build upon the existing work by <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and any other place-based partnership to integrate services.</p>

<p>Decisions should continue to be made as close as possible to local communities with decisions taken at a system level only where there is good reason to do so.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Working together at system level is helpful for issues that benefit from being tackled at scale. <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> strategies and priorities should not detract from or undermine the local collaboration at place. It is acknowledged that there is a wide diversity within <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> areas in terms of geography, population size and configuration of local authorities and NHS partners.</p>

<p>We therefore recognise that different approaches are required from one local population or area to another, and that there will be different levels of maturity and development.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> has developed several <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/case-studies" rel="external">case studies that highlight the ways in which <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> are already working to improve planning, service delivery and outcomes for their local populations</a>.</p>

<h3>Continuity</h3>

<p>The functions and duties that previously rested with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> have been conferred on <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> – therefore, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> will continue the relationships and accountability they had with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> with <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forward plans (formerly commissioning plans)</li>
  <li>annual reports</li>
  <li>performance assessments</li>
</ul>

<h4>NHS England</h4>

<p>In undertaking its annual performance assessment of an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>, NHS England must include an assessment of how well the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> has met the duty to have regard to the relevant <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> and <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategies">JLHWSs</abbr> within its footprint.</p>

<p>In conducting the performance assessment, NHS England must consult each relevant <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> as to its views on the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>’s contribution to the delivery of any <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> to which it was required to have regard.</p>

<p>These duties are similar to how NHS England was required to assess <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> previously.</p>

<h4>Local authorities</h4>

<p>Each local authority with statutory children’s and adult social care, and public health responsibilities has had a <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> in place since 1 April 2013, though many shadow boards were in operation before then.</p>

<p>District councils may create a <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> either as a subcommittee of a statutory <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> or as a local committee, though they are not required by statute to do so.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> can decide to jointly carry out their functions with one or more other <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>.</p>

<p>They may, for example, choose to set up a joint committee. Several local authorities have created joint <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> across a wider footprint in order to address strategic priorities. Example case studies of these joint <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> can be accessed through the <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>’s shared learning resources (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/sector-support-offer/care-and-health-improvement/health-and-wellbeing-systems-0" rel="external">Case studies: Developing joint health and wellbeing board arrangements</a>.</p>

<h4>Pooled or aligned budgets</h4>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> do not commission health services themselves, and do not have their own budget, but play an important role in informing the allocation of local resources. This includes responsibility for signing off the Better Care Fund plan for the local area and providing governance for the pooled fund that must be set up in every area.</p>

<p>Their role in joining up the health and care system, and driving integration will not be changed by the establishment of <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Changes to previous arrangements</h3>

<p>This section sets out the changes that apply to both <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> together in relation to their relationship with <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>, and also sets out the changes that impact each separately.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> will now receive a copy of an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> joint capital resource plan outlining their planned capital resource use. It is intended that, in sharing these with <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>, there will be opportunity to align local priorities, and provide consistency with strategic aims and plans.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> (and other place-based partnerships) will work with <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> to determine the integrated approach that will best deliver holistic and streamlined care and prevention activities, including action on wider determinants in their communities. <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will need to be aware of the work already being undertaken at place and build upon this. They should not seek to overrule or replace existing place-based plans.</p>

<p><abbr title="joint strategic needs assessments">JSNAs</abbr> will be used by <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> to develop their integrated care strategy, identifying where the assessed needs within the <abbr title="joint strategic needs assessment">JSNA</abbr> can be met by local authorities, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> or NHS England in exercising their functions.</p>

<p>The Health and Care Act 2022 requires an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and each responsible local authority whose area coincides with or falls wholly or partly within the board’s area to establish a joint committee for the board’s area (an <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>). The expectation is that all <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> in an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> area will be involved in the preparation of the integrated care strategy, but there is flexibility in how this happens in different areas. <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will need to ensure that there are mechanisms within their system to ensure collective input to their strategic priorities.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> will now be required to consider revising their <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> following the development of the integrated care strategy for their area.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> If, having considered the integrated care strategy, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> consider their existing <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> to be sufficient, there is no requirement to refresh.</p>

<p>Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) reviews of integrated care systems will assess the provision of NHS care, public health and adult social care within the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> area. They will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how well the <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>, local authorities and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered providers discharge their functions in relation to the provision of care</li>
  <li>the functioning of the system as a whole, which will include the role of the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> is required to publish a report providing an independent assessment of the health and care in integrated care systems.</p>

<h4>Integrated care boards (<abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Every <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> that is within the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>’s area will be represented on the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>. It is important that the previous local knowledge, strategies and relationships developed by <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> are built upon in the new system.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> will need to ensure that there is the right balance between system-level and place-level working. Further information on how <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> or <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> will work together is available through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/must-know-integrated-health-and-care-how-do-you-know-your-council-doing-all-it-can" rel="external">Must Know: Integrated health and care – how do you know your council is doing all it can to promote integration to improve health and social care outcomes at a time of change?</a> <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> resource.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> will, as a minimum, be a statutory joint committee of an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and each responsible local authority within the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>’s area. These members will be able to, at their discretion, appoint further members. We expect that, for <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> to be effective, we will need to have a broader membership. These will build on existing partnership arrangements and actively support approaches where these are working well in line with the new legislation.</p>

<h4>Health and Care Act 2022 – <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>
</h4>

<h5>Joint forward plans</h5>

<p>Before the start of each financial year, an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and its partner NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts must prepare a joint forward plan.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> must involve <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>joint forward plans for the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and its partner NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts must set out any steps that the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> proposes to take to implement any <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and its partner NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts must involve each relevant <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> in preparing or revising their forward plans</li>
  <li>in particular, the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> must be provided with a draft of the forward plan and consult with the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> on whether the draft takes proper account of each relevant <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>following consultation, any <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> within the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>’s area has the right to respond to the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and may give its opinion to NHS England</li>
  <li>within the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>’s forward plan, it must include a statement from the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> as to whether the <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> has been taken into proper account within the forward plan</li>
  <li>with the establishment of <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and the abolishment of <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, the former requirement for <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> to share their commissioning plans with <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> is now removed</li>
</ul>

<p>These duties do not change how <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> previously engaged with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> on their commissioning plans – the change is from <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> to <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> and commissioning plan to forward plan.</p>

<h5>Annual reports</h5>

<p><abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> are required as part of their annual reports to review any steps they have taken to implement any <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> to which they are required to have regard. In preparing this review, the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> must consult each relevant <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>.</p>

<p>These duties do not change how <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> previously engaged with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> on their annual reports – the change is from <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> to <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>.</p>

<h5>Joint capital resource use plans</h5>

<p><abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and their partner NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts are required to share their joint capital resource use plans and any revisions with each relevant <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is a new duty on an <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> not previously required of a <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Integrated care partnerships (<abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr>)</h4>

<p><abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should identify priorities that can best be addressed at system level. <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> will continue to provide leadership across place level. The relationship between an <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> and <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> will vary depending on the number of <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> in the system, their maturity and the existing partnership arrangements.</p>

<p>There are a small number of <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> areas that are coterminous with a single upper tier local authority. Since <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> have similar purposes, local authorities and <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> may choose to bring their <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> together if many of the same parties are involved, and so it would be more efficient. This can be done by one part of the meeting formally being of the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> and the other part of the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should use the insight and data held by <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> around place in developing the integrated care strategy.</p>

<p>The integrated care strategy is intended to build on and not duplicate or supersede the <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>. The 5-year joint forward plan produced by the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> must have regard to the integrated care strategy and must set out any steps on how the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> proposes to implement any <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr> that relates to the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> area.</p>

<p>We expect <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> to work collaboratively in the preparation of the system-wide integrated care strategy that will tackle those challenges that are best dealt with at a system level – for example, workforce planning or data and intelligence sharing.</p>

<p>The integrated care strategy is for the whole population (covering all ages) and it must, among other requirements, consider whether their needs could be met more effectively by using integration arrangements under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/41/section/75" rel="external">section 75 of the National Health Service Act 2006</a>. When they receive integrated care strategy, <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> must consider whether to revise the <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>. Alongside the <abbr title="joint local health and wellbeing strategy">JLHWS</abbr>, the integrated care strategy should be the set direction for the system as a whole.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr>,&nbsp;where there is just one joint local health and wellbeing board in their area, it is up to the <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> to determine how the 2 strategies will complement each other, and ensure that the assessed needs are addressed between them.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In many areas, place-based partnership arrangements go beyond strategic planning and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shared leadership roles</li>
  <li>joint commissioning between local authorities and the NHS</li>
  <li>integrated service delivery by a range of providers</li>
</ul>

<p>The new legislation is intended to give increased flexibility to systems to enable greater integration at place and system level.</p>
</div>

<h2>Questions for engagement</h2>

<p>We would like to engage with all sectors in the development of this guidance. Below we have included areas upon which we would welcome feedback:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what examples can you provide of how <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> are reacting to the introduction of <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> or <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> brought about by the Health and Care Act 2022?</li>
  <li>are there any issues you are encountering with the introduction of <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> or <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> that are affecting <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>?</li>
  <li>are there new ways of working emerging that you would be happy to share as best practice?</li>
  <li>how are <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> working to join up to ensure that they are part of discussions around implementation of the proposals in the integration white paper?</li>
  <li>we acknowledge the great work the <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> do in supporting <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and the resources they provide. In the final guidance we would like to provide examples in the form of diagrams and so on outlining the different structures and scenarios <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> operate within, and would welcome examples or case studies</li>
  <li>does this guidance provide the information you need? Are there any gaps?</li>

    ‘Inclusion health’ is a ‘catch-all’ term used to describe people who are socially excluded, typically experience multiple overlapping risk factors for poor health (such as poverty, violence and complex trauma), experience stigma and discrimination, and are not consistently accounted for in electronic records (such as healthcare databases).

    HWBs should consider groups who might be excluded from engagement, such as inclusion health groups, those who face other forms of social exclusion, transient populations, people at risk of homelessness, children and young people, or those who provide care to people in the HWB but live outside it.<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:8" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>

    This should look at specific groups (such as those likely to have poor health outcomes – for example, care-experienced children and young people) and wider issues that affect health (such as housing or risk of homelessness, employment, education, crime, community safety, transport or planning). Evidence can be identified through public services data that identifies risk of homelessness and the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities’ inclusion health monitoring system, to be launched in 2023.<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:9" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
