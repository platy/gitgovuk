<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1. This guide explains how, if you are interested in the outcome of an appeal, you can make your views known.</p>

<p>1.2. Please note – there are separate guides for appeals that are proceeding by the written representations or inquiry process. You can access all our guides through <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>1.3. <strong>If you need this guide in large print, in audio format or in Braille, please contact our Customer Support Team on 0303 444 5000.</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who decides an appeal and what are the rules?</h2>

<p>2.1. Planning and listed building consent applications are made to the local planning authority (LPA) which will usually be the local council but may be a National Park Authority. Appeals are made to us and may be made for a number of reasons, but most are made because the LPA has refused planning permission or consent.</p>

<p>2.2. Nearly all appeals are decided by our Inspectors; a very small percentage are decided by the Secretary of State - these tend to be the very large or contentious proposals.</p>

<p>2.3. For:</p>

<p>(a) an appeal in relation to an application for planning permission; or</p>

<p>(b) an appeal in relation to listed building consent;</p>

<p>the hearing is held under:</p>

<p>The Town and Country Planning (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2000/1626 (as amended).</p>

<p>2.4. The Business and Planning Act 2020 now provides greater flexibility, allowing appeal procedures to be combined. If we have decided initially that an appeal should follow the hearings procedure, we may subsequently also consider whether a ‘combined procedure’, with some issues dealt with by written representations might be appropriate. If a ‘combined procedure’ is decided upon, how the combined procedure should operate is at our discretion on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How you find out about the appeal</h2>

<p>3.1. If you wrote to the LPA about the planning application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it should write to tell you about the appeal after we have accepted it as valid; and</li>
  <li>when the arrangements have been made for the hearing it should let you know when and where it will take place.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2. These are the minimum publicity requirements. Your LPA may give appeals more publicity and will probably put information on its website. It may publish details of the hearing in a local newspaper if it thinks it is necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>The hearing procedure</h2>

<p>4.1. Please see the Annexe to the guide for the hearing timetable for planning appeals.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What you can do</h2>

<p>5.1. The LPA will send us copies of any letters of support or objection it received about the application while considering it. These will be fully considered by the Inspector who decides the appeal.</p>

<p>5.2. If you did not write at application stage, or you did write and now have something new to say, you can send us your representations about the appeal.</p>

<p>5.3. You should be able to see copies of the appeal documents, including the appellant’s representations at the LPA’s offices before the deadline for you to make your comments.</p>

<p>5.4. The time limit given in the rules for sending representations to us is important, and everyone taking part in an appeal must follow it. <strong>If you send us representations after the end of the time limit, we will not normally accept them. Instead we will return them to you.  This means that the Inspector will not see them and so will not be able to take them into account.</strong></p>

<p>5.5. So you <strong>must</strong> make sure that we receive your representations within the deadline given by the LPA when it notified you of the appeal.  If it is decided that a combined procedure would be appropriate, further written representations may be invited from the parties, if considered necessary, within a specified timetable.</p>

<p>5.6. When you send us your representations you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address;</li>
  <li>the Planning Inspectorate appeal reference number (this will start APP/…);</li>
  <li>the address of the appeal site;</li>
</ul>

<p>and say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I am against the appeal proposals’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appeal proposals’ and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.7. You can make your representations <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">online using the search facility</a> or you can write to or email us. The LPA should have told you our case officer’s contact details. Our case officer is responsible for the administration of the appeal.</p>

<p>5.8. If you send us your representations in a letter, unless your handwriting is very clear it would help if you are able to have your representations typed.  Please note that we do not acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>5.9. We will copy your representations to the appellant, to any statutory parties and to the LPA (we refer to these as “the main parties”) where they will be available for anyone to see them.</p>

<p>5.10. However, if we consider that your representations contain inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, we will send them back to you before the Inspector or anyone else sees them. If you take out the inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, you can send your representations back to us; but you must send them back before the time limit ends.</p>

<p>5.11. We do not accept anonymous representations, but you may ask for your name and address to be withheld. If you ask us to do this you should make sure that your representations do not include any other information which may identify you. We will copy your representations, with your name and address removed, to the main parties, and they will be seen by the Inspector who may give them less weight as a result.</p>

<p>5.12. If you indicate that you do not want us to copy your representations to the main parties, we will return them. They will not be seen by the Inspector and, therefore, will not be taken into account. This is because the Inspector can only take into account representations which have been copied to the main parties and are available to be seen.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>What is considered?</h2>

<p>6.1. The Inspector can only take into account information and evidence that is relevant to the appeal. This could cover a wide range of issues, but those that apply are usually set out in the LPA’s decision notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>If you decide to send documents to support your representations</h2>

<p>7.1. Please note that we are unable to return any documents or photographs.</p>

<p>7.2. Please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a font such as Arial or Verdana in a size of 11 point or larger;</li>
  <li>use <strong>A4</strong> paper wherever possible;</li>
  <li>number the pages of the documents;</li>

  <li>print documents on both sides of a page. You should use paper of good enough quality that something printed on one side of the page does not show through to the other side;</li>
  <li>ensure that the scale and orientation of any maps and plans are shown clearly. If you are sending maps or plans by email or through the GOV.UK you <strong>MUST</strong> tell us the paper size;</li>
  <li>do not send original documents unless we specifically ask for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.3. Please see Annexe I: “Communicating electronically with us” of our “Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England” for additional guidance about sending us documents electronically or by email: <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Audio/video evidence</h2>

<p>8.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us in advance of the hearing. You may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, and the main parties. Please send this within the 5 week deadline for representations. Also you may ask the Inspector at the hearing if he or she is willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing.</p>

<p>8.2. It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>8.3. If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties  Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Before the hearing</h2>

<p>9.1. Local people are encouraged to take part in the hearing process. Local knowledge and opinion can often be a valuable addition to the evidence given by the appellant and the LPA.</p>

<p>9.2. The appellant and LPA should jointly prepare a statement of common ground. This should list all agreed matters and should include basic facts such as the site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, and as many other matters as possible relating to the application. It should be available at the LPA’s offices.</p>

<p>9.3. Before going to the hearing, if you want to see everything that the appellant and the LPA have written, you will be able to see copies of all the appeal documents at the LPA’s offices.</p>

<p>9.4. Depending on whether you oppose or support the appeal you may wish to consult the LPA or the appellant to find out what their position will be at the hearing to help you decide whether your position can be satisfactorily represented by them.</p>

<p>9.5. Hearings are open to members of the public, and although you do not have a legal right to speak, the Inspector will normally allow you to do so. If you want to speak at the hearing, you need to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Some people prefer to make, or read out, a brief statement giving their views. If there are several people with the same views, it is a good idea for one person to speak on behalf of the others.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Hearing venue</h2>

<p>10.1. We ask the LPA to arrange the hearing venue. Hearings are usually held in LPA offices, village halls or community centres. We have set out the facilities that a hearing venue should include. You can access our document <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/setting-up-a-venue-for-a-public-inquiry-hearing-or-examination">“The venue and facilities for public inquiries and hearings” on GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>10.2. The Planning Inspectorate has previously conducted hearings and inquiries on a face-to-face basis, with participants being physically present at a venue such as a council office or town hall.  However, in order to keep staff and customers safe during the current pandemic while still progressing casework, we have had to convert our hearings and inquiries into ‘virtual’ events where participants connect remotely to an online video conference.  (In a very limited number of cases we may also be able to offer a ‘blended’ event which has both physical and virtual elements). Please refer to our ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-inspectorate-virtual-events-guide-to-participating">Guide to taking part in planning, listed building, enforcement and specialist casework appeals proceeding by a virtual hearing or inquiry – England</a>’.  However, the guidance in this document about taking part in hearings applies equally to virtual events.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>People with disabilities</h2>

<p>11.1. We want to hold all hearings in buildings with proper facilities for people with disabilities. If you, or anyone you know, want to go to the hearing and you have particular needs, please contact the LPA to confirm that it can make proper arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Openness and transparency</h2>

<p>12.1. Hearings are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>12.2. If you want to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, you should contact us and the LPA in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>What happens at the hearing?</h2>

<p>13.1. The hearing is an inquisitorial process led by the Inspector who identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made.</p>

<p>13.2. The Inspector will open the hearing by explaining what the appeal is about. He or she will then go through some routine points and explain how he or she intends to proceed and will ask who wants to speak.</p>

<p>13.3. The order in which people speak at a hearing on any topic that needs to be discussed will be tailored to the individual appeal and who is at the hearing. The Inspector will usually outline the main issues and any other matters to be discussed. The Inspector will ensure that the hearing is orderly so everyone involved can have a fair hearing.</p>

<p>13.4. The appellant will usually give his or her views on a topic first, followed by the LPA, and then anyone else who wants to comment.</p>

<p>13.5. The Inspector will make it clear that there is no need to repeat comments you have already made in your earlier representations (to the LPA or to us) or points which have been covered by other participants.</p>

<p>13.6. If you make comments, or have any questions, you must put them through the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Inspector’s questions</h2>

<p>14.1. At any stage during proceedings the Inspector may ask questions. Questions may be put to all those who give evidence, including interested people.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Discussion of planning conditions</h2>

<p>15.1. A hearing will usually include a discussion about the conditions which may be imposed if the proposal is granted planning permission. The fact that conditions are discussed does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Closing statements</h2>

<p>16.1. Finally (so far as dealing with evidence about the case is concerned) there are closing statements which are an opportunity for the main parties to sum up their case. They are usually read out from a pre-prepared version which they will give to the Inspector and those other parties who have summed up their case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>17.1. The Inspector will then hear any applications for costs. All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>17.2. There is guidance about costs awards in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/collections/planning-practice-guidance">Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a></p>

<p>17.3. It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>17.4. Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Site visit</h2>

<p>18.1. Once any claim for costs has been heard the Inspector will make arrangements for the site visit (unless that has already taken place during the hearing). The Inspector will make it clear if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would be helpful to carry on the discussion on the site and so will not close the hearing until after the site visit; or</li>
  <li>it appears that all discussion has been completed and the hearing will be closed before going to the site. In this circumstance there will be no further discussion of the merits of the case at the site.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>The decision</h2>

<p>19.1. When made, the decision will be published and can be viewed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">online using the search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>Complaints about a decision made by administrative staff</h2>

<p>21.1. If you wish to complain about a decision made by administrative staff during the processing of an appeal you should write to our Case Officer giving clear reasons why you think we should review our decision.</p>

<p>21.2. For decisions made by administrative staff during the processing of an appeal there is no statutory right to challenge that decision in the High Court. However it is possible to make an application for judicial review of such a decision. For further information please see Annexe L “<a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">How can a decision be challenged” of our “Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England</a>”</p>
