<p>Dear colleague,</p>

<h2>Regulation fees in 2022-23</h2>

<p>I am writing to provide an update on the regulator’s annual fees for 2022-23.</p>

<p>For 2021-22 we were able to hold our overall fee income at the same level as 2020-21 and our overall fees can again be held at the same amount for 2022/23. The fee per unit paid by large providers, with 1,000 or more units, will be £5.31. This is a reduction from last year’s level of £5.36 due to sector growth. Fees for providers with fewer than 1,000 units will remain at £300 per year.</p>

<p>Invoices for 2022/23 annual fees will be issued in early March and should be paid within 30 days. 
Any unspent fee income for a financial year is rebated to the sector after our audited accounts are laid in Parliament.</p>

<p>A fee rebate will again be made this year for unspent 2020-21 annual fees. Historically, rebates have been processed as a funds transfer, however this has created administrative issues for a small number of providers. We indicated in our fees guidance  for 2021-22 that during 2021 we would review the approach to rebates to minimise the administrative burden on providers and <abbr title="Regulator of Social Housing">RSH</abbr>.</p>

<p>Following that review we will change the approach to rebates and from this year rebates will be included on the invoice for the incoming fee year, allowing providers to pay the net balance.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>Richard Peden</p>

<p>Director of Finance and Corporate Services</p>
