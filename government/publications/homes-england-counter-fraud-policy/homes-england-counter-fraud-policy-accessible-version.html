<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Scope of this Document</h2>

<p>This document forms part of the Homes England Financial Crime Compliance Framework. This Framework includes policy, procedures and guidance to mitigate the risk of fraud, bribery, corruption, money-laundering, theft, modern slavery and other criminal acts; and encourages the reporting of crime or attempted crime and whistleblowing.</p>

<p>The key principles and reporting requirements within this Counter Fraud Policy are common for both internal audiences (our workforce) and external audiences (organisations and individuals we engage with); however, this specific document is prepared for external audiences only and published on Gov.uk.</p>

<p>Homes England recognises that its national role, its regulatory interventions, investment decisions and procurement and disposal activities involving high value assets, make it vulnerable to the risk of fraud, bribery and corruption. Homes England is therefore committed to the highest level of ethical standards and sound governance arrangements and sets high standards of impartiality, integrity and objectivity in relation to the stewardship of public funds and the management of its activities.</p>

<p>Homes England adopts zero tolerance to fraud, bribery and corruption, and has a  pro-active stance in the prevention, detection and reporting of fraud, bribery and corruption.</p>

<p>This document provides the means for any staff member, contractor, non-employee, body or entity to report and allegation of fraud that is likely to or has impacted Homes England. As such this document will provide guidance on the steps Homes England will take to investigate any such allegations. Any external reporting should be made to the Financial Crime Compliance Team using the following e-mail address</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Quick-reference Guidance Note – Reporting Fraud</h2>

<p>This Guidance Note is part of the Homes England Anti-fraud Policy and Response Plan.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Checklist summary for staff discovering actual or attempted fraud</h3>

<h4>Do</h4>

<h4>Report your suspicions promptly</h4>

<p>Any suspicion of fraud or other irregularity must be reported in the first instance - and as a matter of urgency – using the following centralised e-mail that is managed by Financial Crime Compliance -</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FCCFraudReporting@Homesengland.gov.uk">FCCFraudReporting@Homesengland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, your concerns should be reported upwards - through your line-management structure where this is appropriate and/or to the General Counsel or Financial Crime Compliance Team.</p>

<p>There are specific reporting requirements which apply to suspicions of money laundering. If your suspicion relates <strong>only to money laundering</strong>, then please contact the MLRO or Deputy MLRO and <strong>not</strong> the Director of Internal Audit or General Counsel</p>

<h4>Make a note of your concerns</h4>

<p>Record all relevant details, such as the nature of your concern, the names of parties you believe to be involved, details of any telephone or other conversations with names dates and times and any witnesses.</p>

<p>Notes do not need to be overly formal, but should be timed, signed and dated.</p>

<p>The longer you delay writing up your notes of events, the greater the chances of recollections becoming distorted and the case being</p>

<h4>Retain any evidence you may have</h4>

<p>The quality of evidence is crucial and the more direct and tangible the evidence, the better the chances of an effective investigation.</p>

<h4>Don’t</h4>

<h4>Don’t be afraid of raising concerns</h4>

<p>The Public Interest Disclosure Act and Home England’s Whistleblowing Policy provides protection for employees who raise reasonably held concerns through the appropriate channels.</p>

<p>You will not suffer discrimination or victimisation as a result of following these procedures and the matter will be treated sensitively and confidentially.</p>

<h4>Don’t convey your concerns to anyone other than authorised persons</h4>

<p>There may be a perfectly reasonable explanation for the events that give rise to your suspicion. Spreading unsubstantiated concerns may harm innocent persons.</p>

<h4>Don’t approach the person you suspect or try to investigate the matter yourself</h4>

<p>There are special rules relating to the gathering of evidence for use in criminal or civil  cases. Any attempt to gather evidence by persons who are unfamiliar with these rules may affect the chain of evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Fraud warning signs – please look out for:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Urgent and unexpected requests to approve large payments ahead of public holidays or late on Friday afternoon – this is a common fraud tactic as detection may be delayed for several days</li>
  <li>Suspicious activities, uncharacteristic behaviour or unexpected displays of conspicuous wealth</li>
  <li>Unexpected requests by email, phone or letter to change payment details or contact details – this is a common fraud tactic and independent checks must be made before making changes</li>
  <li>Emails with unexpected attachments and especially from non-work-related addresses which contain obvious language or spelling errors</li>
  <li>Unsolicited requests for sensitive financial information, banking details or IT information</li>
  <li>Documents, data, information or applications that appear odd, altered or tampered with</li>
  <li>Unexplained changes to a standard procedure or the way somebody works</li>
  <li>Evidence that existing procedures have been bypassed or short-circuited</li>
  <li>Unusual requests to provide commercially sensitive, confidential or personal information</li>
  <li>The overarching feeling that specific fraud controls are less than effective</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Examples of fraud risk identified as relevant to Homes England</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Changes requested to third party bank details to divert loans, grants and supplier payments</li>
  <li>Obtaining our sensitive financial, banking or IT information to attack control resilience or fraudulent purposes such as ransom or passing-off</li>
  <li>False orders or claims for work undertaken or false applications for grants or investment</li>
  <li>Fraudulent procurement activities such as bid collusion, bribery or other contract related fraud</li>
  <li>Actual or attempted theft of operational assets including high-value equipment</li>
  <li>Property fraud including diversion of rent, unauthorised land use and encroachment</li>
  <li>Inappropriate disclosure or manipulation of data or information for financial gain</li>
  <li>IT / cyber-attacks including installation of ransom ware, viruses and similar malware</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous employee related fraud including falsified working hours and expense claims and the misuse of corporate credit cards</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Counter Fraud Policy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>1: Homes England requires its staff, and organisations we engage with to act honestly and with integrity to safeguard the public resources for which we are responsible.</p>

<p>2: We adopt a <strong>zero-tolerance approach</strong> to fraud and all forms of corruption and bribery associated with fraudulent or criminal acts. Any incident that is reported will be investigated and could lead either to either civil or criminal action, internal discipline and even possibly dismissal.</p>

<p>3: Fraud may occur internally or externally, and the purpose of this document is to set out responsibilities with regard to fraud prevention, what to do if fraud or irregularity is suspected and the response that will be taken by Homes England.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Legal Definitions</h3>

<p>4: The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/contents" rel="external">Fraud Act 2006</a> identifies:</p>

<p>·    Fraud by false representation</p>

<p>·    Fraud by failing to disclose information</p>

<p>·    Fraud by abuse of position</p>

<p>5: The Ministry of Justice define E-enabled / Cyber fraud as the generic term commonly employed when information technology has been used to manipulate programs or data dishonestly e.g. by altering, substituting, destroying records or creating spurious records or where the use of an IT system was a material factor in the perpetration of a fraud. This includes theft or fraudulent use of computer time and resources. Examples include altering, substituting or destroying records, or creating spurious record. Theft or fraudulent use of computer time and resources, including unauthorised personal browsing on the internet, is included in this definition.</p>

<p>6: HM Treasury include the following in their definition of fraud: theft, bribery and corruption, deception and collusion; however, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents" rel="external">UK Bribery Act 2010</a> consolidates and updates all previous bribery legislation.</p>

<p>7: Although bribery and money-laundering suspicions require separate reporting arrangements, if you are unsure which category of crime has occurred you must report your suspicions without delay using the following e-mail <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FCCFraudReporting@Homesengland.gov.uk">FCCFraudReporting@Homesengland.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>8: The government has defined a set of 49 fraud typologies for the purposes of consistent reporting by departments.</p>

<p>9:  Not all fraud risk events are applicable to Homes England’s activities and therefore the organisation currently adopts a focused set of external and internal risk events to cover our operational risk scope, including but not limited to the following key categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>False payment claims (investment and grants)</li>
  <li>Fraudulent procurement / Contract fraud</li>
  <li>False or duplicate invoices / False orders / Diversion of funds</li>
  <li>Theft of land and property assets / Theft of operational assets</li>
  <li>Inappropriate disclosure of information / IT attacks including ransom ware</li>
  <li>Employee related fraud including falsified working hours and expenses</li>
  <li>Mandatory identification at programme and operating area level of fraud risk cause, consequence and control.</li>
</ul>

<p>10: Guidance in relation to fraud typologies is available from the Financial Crime Compliance Team.</p>

<p>11: The Bribery Act 2010 (see also Annex A)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two general offences covering the offering, promising or giving of a bribe (active bribery) and the requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting of a bribe (passive bribery) (sections 1 and 2);</li>
  <li>A discrete offence of bribing a foreign public official in order to obtain or retain business or an advantage in the conduct of business (section 6);</li>
  <li>An offence which can be committed by commercial organisations which fail to prevent bribery committed on their behalf (section 7), it therefore needs to demonstrate that it has in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery.</li>
  <li>An organisation will have a defence to the corporate offence if it can show that it had in place “adequate procedures” designed to prevent the offences under the Act. Guidance in the form of 6 Principles is included at attached at Appendix A.</li>
  <li>Raising the maximum sentence for bribery committed by an individual from 7 to 10 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for an offence committed by a corporate body is an unlimited fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>12: Active Bribery (General Offence)</p>

<p>As a government agency Homes England will not tolerate any internal action which encourages, implies, bestows, tolerates or promises an unfair, unlawful, improper or unethical advantage to any individual, group or organisation, regardless of whether there is financial inducement or not.</p>

<p>Key measures designed to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of active bribery include existing financial controls and constraints, transparent reporting and publishing of all expenditure over £250, centralised advertising and publication of all contracts exceeding £10,000, internal and external auditing procedures and the national publication of financial accounts.</p>

<p>13: Passive Bribery (General Offence)</p>

<p>Homes England will not tolerate the acceptance of bribes to induce a favourable investment or regulatory decision, property transaction or other business outcome.</p>

<p>At all times Homes England expects its Board and Committee Members, Executive Directors, staff and consultants acting on our behalf to conduct their work ethically and to fully comply with their terms and conditions of employment and Homes England policies and procedures.</p>

<p>Additional controls include: segregation of decision making, the policy, rules and recording procedures relating to the acceptance of corporate hospitality and gifts; the mandatory declaration of Board Members, Committee Members, Directors and staff conflicts of interest; the publication, updating and circulation of these policies internally and externally; periodic risk assessment, compliance monitoring and review; and the enforcement of disciplinary and authority reporting procedures where appropriate.</p>

<p>14: Bribing a Foreign Public Official (Discrete Offence)</p>

<p>Homes England primarily engages with UK officials; however, there may be rare occasions when we meet representatives from foreign governments accompanying inward investors or organisations on-site fact-finding trips.</p>

<p>Homes England will not tolerate bribery or any other corrupt practice to produce a favourable outcome. In all its dealings Homes England employees should consider and apply the Nolan <strong>Principles (See Annex B).</strong></p>

<p>The bestowal of over-generous hospitality to an official is therefore inappropriate; and “only receipted proven meal expenses will be reimbursed”. Token memorial souvenir gifts in keeping with the nature of the visit may occasionally be offered or exchanged between organisations and their officials (historic examples include a group framed photograph commemorating the event, or a book recording the history of the area or project). Where such gifts are exchanged regard should be had to Homes England’s Gifts and Hospitality Policy.</p>

<p>15: Corruption may be defined as:</p>

<p>“Dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power typically involving bribery”.</p>

<p>16: Declaration of conflicts of interest</p>

<p>A ‘conflict of interest’ is considered to be any connection or association with a third party that is (or appears to be) against the best interests of Homes England, or which could enable you reasonably to be suspected of using your position within Homes England to gain an unfair advantage for or from a third party.</p>

<p>Conflicts of interest are best avoided altogether; however, Homes Englandomesd H acknowledges that conflicts of interest (and potential conflicts) are sometimes unavoidable. In such circumstances the principles of openness and integrity apply, and you are required to disclose and manage the conflicts accordingly.</p>

<p>17: Theft Act 1968</p>

<p>The Theft Act 1968 defines theft as follows:</p>

<p>“A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates (takes/removes) property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it”.</p>

<p>This could mean the theft of cash, equipment, data or vehicles. This does not simply relate to property owned by Homes England and includes theft of property belonging to a colleague.</p>
