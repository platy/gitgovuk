<p>The aim of the Heel test is to indicate whether significant modifications have been made to the vessel, its gear or gear handling arrangement or if the changes you have made to the vessel have significantly changed the vessels stability.</p>

<p>It is preferable to use components of the actual gear, lifted from a block in its highest &amp; or furthest outboard location, to give a measurable heel angle such that the heeling test will relate directly to the vessels typical fishing operation. E.g. A beam trawler could lift one beam trawl from a horizontal derrick on one side, typically this will result in a heel angle of about 10°. Any increase in the trawl weight or derrick length, or decrease in the stability, will result in a larger heel angle.</p>

<p>The Heel test can be repeated to assess modifications to the vessel or to assess the effects of cumulative weight gain over time.</p>

<p>It is essential that the repeat test is conducted with the vessel arrangement and test weight being as close as possible to the previous test.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Arrange the vessel in the depart port condition, an empty hold, no ice and full tanks and stores are advised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vessel should be trimmed upright by movement of loose gear or tank contents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The heel angle can be measured with a simple inclinometer, provided it enables a suitable level of accuracy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use an outboard derrick to lift a typical to normal fishing operation weight from the derrick.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vessel will be judged to have an acceptable standard of stability if the test shows that;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the angle of heel does not exceed 7° and in the case of a vessel with a watertight weather deck extending from stem to stern, the freeboard to deck is not less than 75mm at any point; or .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if unable to meet the criteria in 5.1 above the angle of heel may exceed 7°, but should not exceed 10°, if the freeboard in the heeled condition is in accordance with that required by Annex 8 of MSN1871 Amendment No.2 in the upright condition.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Measure and record the result from the inclinometer, if it is the first heel test make sure you record this for comparison with subsequent tests. Each subsequent test should be within 10% of the original heel test, this figure allows for the slight variation in conditions of test, if the figure is greater the 10% of the original heel test then professional advice should be sought.</p>
