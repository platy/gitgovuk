<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The aim of this Code of Practice is to improve safety in the less than 15 metres Length Overall (LOA) sector of the fishing industry and to raise the safety awareness of all those involved with the construction, operation and maintenance of such Vessels.</p>

<p>The content of the Code has been the subject of extensive discussion with the Fishing Industry Safety Group to oversee its development. If the Code needs to be updated at any time to take account of new statutory requirements that apply to Vessels operating under the Code, the organisations involved in the development of the Code will be consulted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1 - GENERAL</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1.1 This Code applies to all Fishing Vessels registered in the UK of less than 15 metres Length Overall (LOA).  It is given legal effect by the Fishing Vessels (Codes of Practice) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/943) and is referred to in the Merchant Shipping (Work in Fishing Convention) Regulations 2018 (S.I 2018/1106).</p>

<p>1.1.2   This Code sets out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the standards to be met before a Vessel can join the Register as a commercial Fishing Vessel and the surveys the Vessel must undergo to demonstrate it meets those standards;</li>
  <li>the minimum requirements that Vessels are expected to meet to obtain a Small Fishing Vessel Certificate which confirms compliance with this Code; these include the requirements for construction, watertight and weathertight integrity, stability, machinery and electrical equipment, fire protection, detection and extinction, crew protection, life-saving appliances, emergency procedures, radio and navigational equipment and crew accommodation, and the inspections the Vessel must undergo to demonstrate it meets those requirements;</li>
  <li>the grounds on which a Small Fishing Vessel Certificate may be suspended or cancelled.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.1.3   A Small Fishing Vessel Certificate will remain valid for up to five years if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a self certification inspection is undertaken every year; and</li>
  <li>the Vessel continues to comply with the Code at all times.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.1.4   The requirements within the Code are considered to be a minimum. There is nothing to prevent an owner or skipper supplementing the requirements stated, providing they are effective and remain fit for purpose. Where new or emerging technologies can be shown to benefit the safe operation of the Vessel the MCA encourages their consideration.</p>

<p>1.1.5	Annex 1 lists the Regulations, MSNs and MGNs which are relevant to Fishing Vessels that are covered by this Code (this list is for guidance purposes only and skippers and owners shall ensure that they are aware of all applicable laws and guidance).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Vessel Definitions</h2>

<p>1.2.1	For the purposes of this Code, there are five categories of Fishing Vessel dependent on age. These are:</p>

<p>1.2.1.1	“Existing Vessel” means a Fishing Vessel registered for first time as a Fishing Vessel before 16 July 2007;</p>

<p>1.2.1.2	“New Vessels (2007)” means a Fishing Vessel registered for the first time as a Fishing Vessel on or after 16 July 2007;</p>

<p>1.2.1.3	“New Vessels (2017)” means a Fishing Vessel registered for the first time as a Fishing Vessel on or after 23 October 2017;</p>

<p>1.2.1.4	“New Vessels (2018)” means a Fishing Vessel in relation to which:</p>

<p>i)	the building or major conversion contract has been placed on or after 31 December 2018; or</p>

<p>ii)	the building or major conversion contract has been placed before 31 December 2018 and which is delivered three years or more after that date; or</p>

<p>iii)	in the absence of a building contract, on or after 31 December 2018:</p>

<p>a.	the keel is laid, or</p>

<p>b.	construction identifiable with a specific Vessel begins, or</p>

<p>c.	assembly has commenced comprising at least 1 per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material;</p>

<p>1.2.1.5	“New Vessels (2021)” means a Fishing Vessel in relation to which:</p>

<p>i)	first registration as a Fishing Vessel took place on or after 6 September 2021 or</p>

<p>ii)	the vessel was previously registered as a Fishing Vessel but has been unregistered for a period of six months or more,  and has  joined the Register on or after 6 September 2021 as a Fishing Vessel again under the requirements set out in section 1.5 of this Code.</p>

<p>1.2.1.6	Each Chapter is structured so that within each heading or sub heading it indicates the Vessel definition to which the requirements are applicable. Where no Vessel definition is provided in a paragraph or section heading, then the requirements apply to all Vessels.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Transitional arrangements</h2>

<p>1.3.1 	From 6 September 2021 Vessels will be inspected against all the requirements of the Code. Each Chapter sets out the requirements to which transistional arrangements apply. Where transistional arrangements apply, if the Vessel is inspected before 6 September 2023 the Vessel is not required to comply with those requirements at that stage. However, the Vessel Owner will be expected to provide proof by 5 September 2023 that the Vessel is in full compliance with all the requirements. Vessels inspected in the 90 days prior to 6 September 2023 will have 90 days from the date of inspection to provide proof that the Vessel is in full compliance with the Code.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2.20 </span>	Water freeing Arrangements – Decked Vessels</h2>

<h4>All Vessels</h4>

<p>2.20.1	For Vessels under 12 m (RL), where, due to the nature of the Vessel’s design this requirement cannot be met or would prove impractical in operation, alternative arrangements based on MSN1892 The Workboat Code section 6.3, or MCA Marine Survey Instructions to Surveyors 27 (MSIS 27) Fishing Vessel Instructions to Surveyors Chapter 2, 2.20 – 2.21, may be accepted on application to MCA. For sealed deck Vessels under 7 m (RL) in length or which operate no more than 20 miles from shore and at all times in favourable weather, a reduction in required freeing port area may be accepted on application to MCA.</p>

<h4>New Vessels (2007), (2017), (2018), (2021)</h4>

<p>2.20.2	New Vessels (2007), (2017), (2018) and, (2021) shall comply with the water freeing arrangements contained in the recognised Construction Standard for Fishing Vessels applicable at the time of construction.</p>

<h4>Existing Vessels</h4>

<p>2.20.4	On Decked Vessels, where the fixed bulwarks, ends or sides of superstructures etc., form enclosed wells, means to clear entrapped water are to be provided and may comprise any, or any combination, of the following:-</p>

<p>2.20.4.1	Freeing ports with an attached means of closing (provided that the freeing port is closed only during fishing operations and that the closing device is easily operable and accessible);</p>

<p>2.20.4.2	Permanent openings in the bulwarks such as slots;</p>

<p>2.20.4.3	Apertures in and under bulwark or stern ramp doors;</p>

<p>2.20.4.4	Deck scuppers where the discharge is above the load waterline.</p>

<p>2.20.5	The minimum area for freeing ports on each side of the well or deck is to be not less than 3% of the total bulwark area each side. Where monohull length/breadth ratios are greater than 2.5 then an additional 1% is required in freeing port area each side. The arrangement of Vessels not built to a recognised Construction and Outfit Standard for Fishing Vessels at the time of construction or when there were no construction standards in place remain acceptable provided that such arrangement continues to remain fit for purpose</p>

<p>2.20.6	The total bulwark area is not to include the minimum height of rail or other openings used to deploy gear when calculating the freeing port area.</p>

<p>2.20.7	Water retained on board the Vessel will reduce stability and increase the risk of capsize. Lift-up closing appliances shall not be fitted to freeing ports, or locking devices fitted to freeing port flaps, if they reduce the total freeing port area along either side of the Vessel below the freeing port requirement. They will only be considered acceptable where they are secure in the open positon and the remaining open freeing port area meets the requirement when the appliances are closed. Lift-up closing appliances should be fitted to no more than 50% of ports.</p>

<p>2.20.8	Freeing ports are to be arranged throughout the length of the bulwark or well to provide maximum drainage under all normal conditions. At the discretion of the surveyor, up to one third of the freeing port area required at each side may be located in the transom bulwark, with the Vessel centreline dividing the port and starboard side allocation. Where the freeing port area in the transom bulwark is greater than the maximum one third allowance per side, the excess area shall not be included in the total freeing port area provided.</p>

<p>2.20.9	Where deck erections within a well limit the volume of water that may be retained onboard, then the freeing port area may be reduced proportionally provided that such erections do not in themselves contribute to water retention.</p>

<p>2.20.10	The means of clearing water must not provide easy access for water to enter the enclosed deck space.</p>

<p>2.20.11	Any freeing port or slot in the bulwark is to have the bottom edge as close to the deck as possible. Freeing ports greater than 230 mm in depth and wider than 350 mm are to be fitted with bars.</p>

<p>2.20.12	Where freeing ports are fitted with hinged flaps or shutters, sufficient clearance to prevent jamming is to be provided and hinges are to be fitted with pins of non-corrodible material. Greasing points or nipples are to be provided where practicable.</p>

<p>2.20.13	Deck pounds, machinery and net or gear stowage shall not impede the free flow of trapped water to the freeing ports or slots.</p>

<p>2.20.14	Where Vessels are fitted with full or partial shelters which are left open at the stern, and where the passage of water forward is not restricted by watertight bulkheads, the freeing port area is to be increased by 1% over the requirement stated in section 2.20.4 above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>	Lightship Particulars for all Vessels required to have approved stability information to the satisfaction of MCA, in accordance with MGN 281(F)</h2>

<p>3.6.1	The lightship weight, vertical centre of gravity (VCG) and longitudinal centre of gravity (LCG) should be determined from the results of an Inclining Test. Guidelines for the procedure on carrying out of an Inclining Test can be found in the Marine Survey Instructions to Surveyors 9 - Instructions for the Guidance of Surveyors on Approvals (MSIS 9), Chapter 1, Annex 3.</p>

<p>3.6.2	An Inclining Test may not produce satisfactory results for Vessels such as multihulls where the VCG is less than one third of the GM over the range of standard operating conditions. In such cases the LCG should be obtained by lightweight check (MSIS 9, Chapter 1, Annex 1) or by weighing with two gauges (e.g. one fore and one aft). The lightship VCG may be obtained by an accurate weight estimate calculation with a suitable margin added, in no case should the lightship VCG be taken below main deck level. Details of the estimated lightship weight, LCG and VCG should be submitted to MCA at an early stage for verification.</p>

<p>3.6.3	The lightship weight may include a margin for growth, up to 5% of the lightship weight at the discretion of MCA, positioned at the LCG and vertical centre of the weather deck amidships or the lightship VCG, whichever is higher. (The lightweight margin should not be used in practice to increase maximum cargo-deadweight).</p>

<h4>New Vessel (2021)</h4>

<p>3.6.4	For any New Vessel (2021) identical to a sister ship or with known differences from a sister ship, a detailed weights and centres calculation to adjust the lead ship’s lightship properties should be carried out.</p>

<p>3.6.4.1	The lightship properties for the New Vessel (2021) may be assessed by carrying out a lightweight check. The deviation in lightship displacement should not exceed 2% of the lightship displacement of the sister ship. In addition, the deviation in lightship LCG should not exceed 1% of the LBP of the sister ship LCG. Where the deviation is within these limits the actual lightship weight and LCG derived from the lightship check should be used in conjunction with the higher of either the lead ship’s VCG or the calculated value.</p>

<p>3.6.4.2	Where the deviation exceeds either of these limits, an Inclining Test should be carried out.</p>

<p>3.6.4.3	A sister ship is defined as a ship built under survey to a Recognised Construction and Outfit Standard for Fishing Vessels, by the same yard from the same plans and within five years of the new ship.</p>

<p>3.6.5	Lightship Particulars shall be repeated at certificate renewal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>	Fire Detectors on Decked Vessels</h2>

<p>5.8.1	On Decked Vessels, battery powered fire detectors and alarms may be suitable under certain circumstances  where they may be easily audible from the wheelhouse and/or deck and would be assessed on a case by case basis by the surveyor to check their suitability for purpose.</p>

<p>5.8.2	On Decked Vessels, sleeping accommodation, galley, machinery spaces, and any spaces containing open flame devices are to be fitted with efficient fire/smoke detectors to give an audible warning in the space they are protecting and at the helm position.</p>

<p>5.8.3	In essence, a fire detector for engine spaces shall be fit for purpose and may be a combination of smoke and/or optical detectors which can be connected by wire or wirelessly to a similar alarm in the wheelhouse. The wifi connection should be tested.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>	Fire Extinguishers (Portable)</h2>

<p>5.9.1	Fire on board a Vessel can, if it is not controlled, lead to the loss of the Vessel and/or serious injuries. The requirements at section 5.7 above and also set out in Annexes 3.1 to 3.6 below give the minimum requirements for the extinguishers to be carried on Fishing Vessels. When extinguishers are replaced, new extinguishers shall comply with BS EN 3, or the The Merchant Shipping (Marine Equipment) Regulations 2016.</p>

<p>5.9.2	There are two sizes quoted in the section 5.7 above:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Designation</th>
      <th scope="col">Equivalent Dry Powder</th>
      <th scope="col"> Equivalent Foam</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>5A/34B</td>
      <td>1 Kg ABC Dry powder</td>
      <td>1.75 Litre. AFFF</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>13A/113B</td>
      <td>4 Kg ABC Dry powder</td>
      <td>2 Gallon or 6 Litres. AFFF</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>5.9.3	The designation gives a measure of the ability of the extinguisher. ‘A’ indicates a wood-based fire; the number indicates fire size which has been used to test the extinguisher. ‘B’ indicates a liquid-based fire; the number indicates the size of fire, which has been used to test the extinguisher.</p>

<p>5.9.4	Where it is not practicable to carry or store a large fire extinguisher, an alternative is to carry a combination of others to make up the required capacity. Add the numbers before the ‘A’ and the ‘B’ together, and if these exceed the total required the extinguishers will provide an equivalent capacity, e.g., two 8A/70B extinguishers would give a capacity of 16A/140B, which is greater than the required 13A/113B.</p>

<p>5.9.5	In any case the minimum acceptable size of extinguisher acceptable would be 5A/34B. A fire may require more than one smaller extinguisher to put it out.</p>

<p>5.9.6	Fire extinguishers shall be serviced and maintained at the manufacturer’s recommended service intervals by a formal service station approved by the manufacturer. In the case of sealed units, these shall be replaced when they reach their expiry date.</p>

<p>5.9.7	Halon, in any form, is not authorised for use.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>	Fire extinguishers (Fixed)</h2>

<p>5.10.1	For Existing Vessels with fixed systems in main engine rooms where the space is never occupied an automatic discharge system may remain acceptable if it is already installed, subject to the agreement of an MCA surveyor, providing that an indication of discharge is given. New Vessels (2007), (2017), (2018) and (2021) are not permitted to have this arrangement and Existing Vessels are not permitted to install such arrangements.</p>

<p>5.10.2	Automatic insert gas aerosol systems are not acceptable when fitted without the ability to make the compartment gastight prior to the release of the agent. AFFF or dry powder systems may be accepted at the discretion of MCA.</p>

<p>5.10.3	For main engine rooms that can be occupied, the system shall be designed and installed in accordance with its manufacturer’s instructions. These spaces shall incorporate an advance warning alarm system, within the space, (audible and visual). The space shall be able to be made gastight to contain the extinguishing agent, and to starve the oxygen supply. Systems fitted shall be based on the class of fire risk.</p>

<p>5.10.4	When installing or changing fixed fire extinguishing systems, MCA shall be informed prior to installation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.11 </span>	Fire buckets</h2>

<p>5.11.1	Fire buckets shall be heavy duty with a lanyard long enough to reach water. Buckets need not be made of steel but must not deform or break when full.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.12 </span>	Fire blankets</h2>

<p>5.12.1	For the galley or cooking appliance, fire blankets shall be of light duty to BS EN 7944 or a recognised equivalent BS EN 1869.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.13 </span>	Fire pumps</h2>

<p>5.13.1	Fire pumps can be a hand pump or any other pump that supplies water from the sea onto the deck with a hose suitable for fire-fighting purposes. Engine driven pumps are acceptable but are liable to failure in the event of an engine compartment fire. The pumps must be capable of supplying a hose or hoses such that a jet of water can reach any part of the Vessel accessible to the crew.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.14 </span>	Emergency routes and exits</h2>

<p>5.14.1	Emergency routes and exits shall be indicated by signs in accordance with The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/ 3444) (see also section 10.2).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6 - PROTECTION OF THE CREW</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This Chapter sets out the minimum requirements for protecting the crew from accidents through risk assessment and ensuring that in areas where accidents may happen, the risk is reduced through preventative and protective measures.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>	Transitional Arrangements</h2>

<h4>New Vessels (2007), (2017), (2018)</h4>

<p>6.1.1	The transitional arrangements as set out in section 1.3 of this Code apply to the following sections of this Chapter;</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.9.2 to 6.9.4 and 6.10.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing Vessels</h3>

<p>6.1.2	The transitional arrangements as set out in section 1.3 of this Code apply to the following sections of this Chapter;</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.9.2 to 6.9.4 and 6.10.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>	Health and Safety Requirements</h2>

<p>6.2.1	The owner (which includes the manager if they have assumed responsibility for the operation of the Vessel) has overall responsibility to ensure that the skipper is provided with the necessary resources and facilities to comply with all the relevant Regulations. The owner should set the health and safety policy for the Vessel so that the skipper is clear what is expected. The owner’s responsibility extends to all crew, whether they are employed or share fishermen. See also  Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessel (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997 (S.I.1997/2962) as amended by The Merchant Shipping (Work in Fishing Convention) (Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1109) and MGN 587(F).</p>

<p>6.2.2 	While the owner always has overall responsibility, it is recognised that if they are not onboard their Fishing Vessel, they may have limited control of day to day activities. The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997 (S.I.1997/2962) provide that responsibility for health and safety also rests with any person who is in control of any particular matter. This will most likely be the skipper in respect of day to day running of the Vessel.</p>

<p>6.2.3	The skipper therefore has responsibility for the safety of crew on board the Vessel and the safe operation of the Vessel. In fulfilling their responsibility MCA expects skippers to:</p>

<p>6.2.3.1	provide supervision to ensure that crew work safely at all times;</p>

<p>6.2.3.2	manage crew in a manner which respects safety and health, including prevention of fatigue;</p>

<p>6.2.3.3 	arrange regular onboard occupational safety and health awareness training; and</p>

<p>6.2.3.4 	ensure compliance with safety of navigation, watchkeeping and associated good seamanship standards.</p>

<p>6.2.4 	The crew shall be given training and instructions on health and safety matters on board Fishing Vessels, and in particular, on accident prevention.</p>

<p>6.2.5	The skipper must not be constrained by the owner from taking any decision which, in the professional judgement of the skipper, is necessary for the safety of the Vessel and its safe navigation and safe operation, of the safety of the crew on board.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>	Risk Assessment</h2>

<p>6.3.1	The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations (S.I. 1997/2962) require employers and owners to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to the health and safety of crew, whether employed, engaged or working in any capacity (except persons solely engaged as pilots) arising in the normal course of their activities or duties. Guidance on these Regulations and on the principles of risk assessment is contained in MGN 587 (M&amp;F).</p>

<p>6.3.2	A risk assessment is intended to be a careful examination of the Vessel’s procedures or operations which could cause harm, so that decisions can be made as to whether adequate control measures are in place to reduce those risks to an acceptable level or whether more shall be done.</p>

<p>6.3.3	The risk assessment shall first identify the hazards that are present and then establish whether a hazard is significant and whether it is already covered by satisfactory precautions to control the risk, including consideration of the likelihood of the failure of those precautions that are already in place.</p>

<p>6.3.4	The risk assessment must also be reviewed regularly, (at least annually) to ensure that it remains appropriate to the Vessel’s fishing method and operation and amended if necessary. If there has been a change of fishing method or of operational practice, or an injury or incident,  the risk assessment must also be reviewed accordingly.</p>

<p>6.3.5	The risk assessment of a Vessel is particular to each employer or owner. When a Vessel is sold, the new employer or owner must complete, or arrange the completion of a new risk assessment.</p>

<p>6.3.6	All members of the crew shall be informed of all measures to be taken regarding health and safety on board the Vessel. Such information must be easily understood and promulgated for all to see by the employer or owner. All members of the crew must sign the  risk assessment to agree it has been understood.</p>

<p>6.3.7	Where risks to the health and safety of the crew cannot be prevented or sufficiently controlled by collective or technical means of protection, they must be provided with personal protective equipment.</p>

<p>6.3.8	Personal protective equipment in the form of clothing or over clothing shall be in bright colours, contrasting with the marine environment and clearly visible. The requirements of The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Personal Protective Equipment) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2205), MSN 1870 and MGN 331 shall be complied with.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>	Statutory Lifejackets and Personal Floatation Devices</h2>

<p>6.4.1	In accordance with the guidance in MGN 588 (F), unless measures are in place which eliminate the risk of crew falling overboard, all crew must be provided with and must wear, Personal Floatation Devices or lifelines and safety harnesses fitted and tethered in such a way as to prevent going overboard. The risk assessment must also take account whether a person is conscious or unconscious if they enter the water, the crew’s training in recovering a person, the equipment in place to recover a person who is either conscious or unconscious and any other factors that may arise. The measures eliminating the risk of man overboard and for recovering a person must be documented in risk assessment. The risk assessment documenting how man overboard and recovery is addressed must be written. MGN 571 contains guidance on preventing man overboard. The following is provided as guidance on Personal Floatation Devices and lifejackets. Further guidance is provided in sections 7.4 and 7.5.</p>

<p>6.4.2	In the event of an abandon ship scenario, individuals should, if time permits, remove their Personal Floatation Devices and don the Statutory lifejacket provided on the Vessel, which will offer them a higher level of buoyancy than their Personal Floatation Device and a greater chance of survival.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>	Safe Access</h2>

<p>6.5.1	Owners and skippers shall also comply with MGN 591 Provision of Safe Means of Access to Fishing Vessels and Small Vessels in Ports.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>	Voluntary Safety Management</h2>

<p>6.6.1	MGN 596 (F) provides guidance on the contents of the voluntary Fishing Safety Management Code (FSM) and how to ensure it remains relevant to a Vessel or company as things change over time.</p>

<p>6.6.2	The FSM itself provides guidance on the documentation required and means for ensuring owners are reminded to  take action to check equipment, service it or carry out maintenance, and assist in complying with their statutory safety obligations.</p>

<p>6.6.3	The FSM provides a system on which Vessels can create safe working procedures and practices.</p>

<p>6.6.4	It is recognised that there are a wide variety of Fishing Vessels, undertaking a wide variety of fishing with different methods of operation. The purpose of the FSM is to establish a common structure which everyone can use to develop a safety management system specific to their Vessel.</p>

<p>6.6.5	A documented safety management system can help demonstrate that Vessels comply with their statutory requirements at all times, and with the requirements of ILO188 The Work in Fishing Convention.</p>

<p>6.6.6	Documentation that should be developed and records maintained include:</p>

<p>6.6.6.1	the safety management manual;</p>

<p>6.6.6.2	company safety and environment policies;</p>

<p>6.6.6.3	all crew certification and training records;</p>

<p>6.6.6.4	planned maintenance system;</p>

<p>6.6.6.5	vessel operation (operating procedures and the risk assessment);</p>

<p>6.6.6.6	testing/certification relating to the lifesaving appliances and fire-fighting equipment;</p>

<p>6.6.6.7	accident and incident reports and any remedial actions taken thereof;</p>

<p>6.6.6.8	evidence of reviews of your safety management system, self-audit reports and close outs thereof;</p>

<p>6.6.6.9	environmental management and pollution prevention;</p>

<p>6.6.6.10	records of drills and safety training.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>	Gas Detection on Decked Vessels</h2>

<p>6.7.1	Suitable means for detecting the leakage of gas (i.e., liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), butane, propane or other flammable gases) shall be provided in any compartment containing a gas-consuming appliance or in any adjoining space or compartment into which the gas, of greater density than air, may seep.</p>

<p>6.7.2	Gas detector heads shall be securely fixed in the lower part of the compartment in the vicinity of the gas-consuming appliance and other space(s) into which gas may seep. In areas where the detector head is susceptible to damage in the lowest part of the compartment (e.g., engine space bilge) the detector head shall at least be fitted below the lowest point of ignition.</p>

<p>6.7.3	The detection system shall incorporate a visible and audible alarm, which can be heard in the space concerned and the control position with the Vessel in operation.</p>

<p>6.7.4	The detection system shall be capable of being tested and be tested on a regular basis whilst the Vessel is in service and shall include a test of the detector head operation as well as the alarm circuit, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>6.7.5	The detection equipment shall be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements and checked that it is operational as part of the Vessel’s regular maintenance regime.</p>

<p>6.7.6	A suitable notice, detailing the action to be taken when an alarm is given by the gas detection system, shall be displayed prominently in the Vessel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>	Carbon Monoxide Alarms</h2>

<p>6.8.1	In all Vessels, Carbon Monoxide alarms shall be installed in every space on all Vessels that have enclosed spaces that contain fired cooking or heating appliances and where an engine exhaust penetrates through the wheelhouse or accommodation space. Fired appliances apply to, but may not be limited to, appliances fired by LPG, diesel or paraffin. Carbon Monoxide alarms are not required when heating or cooking is undertaken using electrical cookers or heaters.</p>

<p>6.8.2	Carbon Monoxide alarms shall be of the lithium battery type and installed, regularly tested, maintained and replaced in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidance.</p>

<p>6.8.3	Signs of Carbon Monoxide include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staining, sooty smears or discolouration of surfaces around an appliance or its flue;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appliances that are difficult to light, keep lit or burn weakly;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>burners with yellow or orange or “floppy” flames that threaten to go out;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an unfamiliar or burning smell when an LPG or oil appliance is on;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>smelling engine exhaust fumes regularly inside the space.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>6.8.4	Carbon Monoxide alarms are a useful back-up precaution but must not be regarded as a substitute for proper installation and maintenance of gas equipment by a Gas Safe registered engineer. When you buy a Carbon Monoxide alarm, ensure it meets current safety standards (BS EN 50291-2) and carries the Kitemark.

<p>7.8.2	All 406 MHz beacons (EPIRB or personal locator beacon) must be registered. Changes to registered beacons must also be notified. The effectiveness of a 406 MHz beacon as a Search and Rescue (SAR) aid depends upon correct registration details being available to the SAR services. If they are not, there is the potential to jeopardise SAR operations, including looking for the wrong Vessel, or stopping a search because it might appear that the Vessel with which the beacon is registered is not in distress.</p>

<p>7.8.3	The beacon manufacturers normally provide two or more identical registration cards on which Vessel operators shall enter the required details, but these are also available from the Royal Yachting Association (Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) Guidelines), Ofcom registration documentation and from MCA via its  website or the EPIRB Registry itself. One is to be returned to the manufacturer as a warranty, while another is sent to the competent authority. Any spare forms shall be retained by the beacon owner.</p>
