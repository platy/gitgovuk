<h2>Decked Vessels</h2>

<p>A Decked Vessel is defined as a Vessel that has a continuous watertight weather deck with positive freeboard in all loading conditions. An Open Vessel is defined as a Vessel which is not a Decked Vessel and Open Vessels should have a positive clear height at side. These requirements are for New Vessels (2021), Vessels joining the Register for the first time or have previously been registered but have been unregistered for six months or more and are applying to rejoin the Register. Existing Vessels which already comply with these requirements must also continue to maintain their Vessel in accordance with these requirements</p>

<p>“Positive freeboard”; for Decked Vessels means:-</p>

<p>For Decked Vessels with a continuous watertight weather deck which is neither stepped or recessed or raised, when fully loaded with cargo and non-cargo deadweight items certificated to be carried (each person taken as 75kg), the Vessel should, when in an upright condition, have a freeboard measured down from the lowest point of the weather deck of not less than 300mm for a Vessel of 7m (RL) or under and not less than 627mm for Vessels of 14.99m in length. For a Vessel of intermediate length the freeboard should be determined by linear interpolation.</p>

<p>For Decked Vessels with a continuous watertight weather deck which may be stepped, recessed or raised, when fully loaded with cargo and non-cargo deadweight items certificated to be carried (each person taken as 75kg), the Vessel should, when in an upright condition, have a freeboard measured down from the lowest point of the weather deck of not less than 200mm for a Vessel of 7m (RL) or under and not less than 345 mm for Vessels of 14.99m LOA. For a Vessel of intermediate length the freeboard should be determined by linear interpolation. The raised portions of the watertight weather deck should extend across the full breadth of the Vessel and the average freeboard over the length of the Vessel should be no less than the requirement for freeboard of a Vessel with a continuous watertight weather deck which is neither stepped, recessed or raised. The following table sets out the stations that should be taken to measure the freeboard of a Vessel to determine the average.</p>

<p>An internal hull moulding built to create a cockpit or cabin sole is not to be considered a watertight weather deck unless the space below the sole is permanently protected from water ingress (except for watertight hatches which are to be kept closed at sea) and provides a space to be used for either accommodation, shelter of persons, stowage, or permanent reserve buoyancy.</p>

<h2>Open Vessel</h2>

<p>An Open Vessel means a Vessel which is not a Decked Vessel and Open Vessels should have a positive clear height at side. Open Vessels can be fitted with decks but because of the insufficient freeboards to the decks cannot be fitted with freeing ports.</p>

<p>These requirements are for New Vessels (2021), Vessels joining the Register for the first time or have previously been registered but have been unregistered for six months or more and are applying to rejoin the Register. Existing Vessels which already comply with these requirements must also continue to maintain their Vessel in accordance with these requirements</p>

<p>“Positive Clear Height at Side”; for Open Vessels means:-</p>

<p>The distance between the waterline (in an upright and fully loaded condition) and the lowest point on the gunwale is not less than 400mm for a Vessel of 7m (RL) or under and not less than 690mm for a Vessel of 14.99m in LOA. For a Vessel of intermediate length the clear height at side should be determined by linear interpolation. The clear height at side should be measured to the top of the gunwale or capping or to the top of the wash strake if one is fitted above the capping.</p>

<p>A Vessel fitted with an internal moulding or sole boards which are non-weathertight and does not provide a space to be used for either accommodation, shelter of persons, stowage, or permanent reserve buoyancy should be treated as an Open Vessel.</p>

<figcaption><p>The person inspecting the vessel shall decide if the vessel’s working deck is weathertight or not. Weathertight means that in any sea conditions water will not penetrate into the vessel.

If the working deck is not weathertight, then the vessel’s operation will be restricted to 20 miles from a safe haven and in favourable weather only. In addition, the vessel shall comply with the following requirements of MSN1871, The Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels of less than 15 metres Length Overall, Section 2.19, water freeing arrangements, Section 3.12, Positive Clear Height at Side requirements and Section 4.20 Bilge pumping requirements. Freeing ports are not permitted. 

A safe haven” means a harbour or shelter of any kind which affords entry, subject to prudence in the weather conditions prevailing, and protection from the forces of weather. 

Favourable weather means conditions existing throughout a voyage or excursion in which the effects either individually or in combination of swell, height of waves, strength of wind and visibility cause no hazard to the safety of the Vessel, including handling ability. In making a judgement on favourable weather, the Skipper should have due regard to official weather forecasts for the service area of the Vessel or to weather information for the area which may be available from the Coastguard or similar coastal safety organisation

If the working deck is weathertight, but the distance of the freeboard to the working deck is less than 200 millimetres of more, then the vessel’s operation shall be restricted to 20 miles from a safe haven in favourable weather. In addition, the vessel shall comply with the following requirements of MSN1871, The Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels of less than 15 metres Length Overall, Section 2.19, water freeing arrangements, Section 3.12, Positive Clear Height at Side requirements and Section 4.20 Bilge pumping requirements. Freeing ports are not permitted. 

If the working deck is weathertight, but the distance of the freeboard to the working deck is 200 millimetres or more but less than 300 millimetres, then the vessel’s operation shall be restricted to 20 miles from a safe haven in favourable weather. Freeing ports shall be fitted in accordance with Section 2.20 of MSN 1871 The Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels of less than 15 metres Length Overall.  

If the working deck is weathertight, and the distance of the freeboard to the working deck is 300 millimetres or more, freeing ports shall be fitted in accordance with Section 2.20 of MSN 1871 The Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Fishing Vessels of less than 15 metres Length Overall.</p></figcaption></figure>
