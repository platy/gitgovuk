<p>In support of the above Business Priority, we commit to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor our performance against the Published standards which set out the timelines and performance categories for a range of key functions*.</p>

    <p>*Performances indicators for the main different types of marketing authorisation application work, the recording and assessment of pharmacovigilance data, some inspection work and the publication of summary of product characteristics (SPC) and public assessment reports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieve an overall performance of ≥92%, which is effective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Report PhV findings to the Veterinary Products Committee and publish those findings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To evaluate all Product Defect reports and respond to ‘High Risk’ ones within 5 working days; and all others within 10 working days.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This document sets out the standards to which the VMD will operate.  The VMD will monitor progress against these targets on a monthly basis.  At the end of the year the results against these standards will be published.  The way in which this information will be presented is detailed at the end of this document.</p>

<p>NOTE: Pharmaceutical assessors and / or GMP inspectors will liaise as necessary with inspectors at the Medicines Healthcare and products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in connection with the inspection of sites producing and / or wholesaling veterinary and human pharmaceutical products where the UK is the Supervisory Authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Evaluation of Applications</h3>

<p>Assessments will be conducted by suitably qualified and trained staff who will undertake appropriate Continuing Professional Development (CPD).</p>

<p>The assessment of applications for new MAs will be subject to an internal peer review process, and review by SciSec or Bio, which are meetings that may involve other government departments.  In a limited number of cases, where specialist advice is required, applications may also be subject to external review by the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC).</p>

<p>Assessments will take into full account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relevant legislation</li>
  <li>The European Pharmacopoeia (or where relevant another EU Pharmacopoeia)</li>
  <li>Relevant guidelines</li>
  <li>VICH guidelines</li>
  <li>Precedents set during previous procedures</li>
  <li>Any relevant information from the scientific literature which may be known to the assessor.</li>
</ul>

<p>In reaching decisions on authorisations the benefits associated with the use of the product will be weighed up against the risks.</p>

<p>On an annual basis a sample of assessments performed by the VMD on applications to obtain new MAs, which have been initially assessed by the VMD, will be examined by the VPC and these will be ranked according to the following criteria:</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Publication of Results</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Individual Results</h3>

<p>Our performance against each target will be published at the end of the year for each category / application type involving at least 12 items / applications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Overall Results</h3>

<p>The following system will be used to obtain a score as an overall measure of the performance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Excellent –	6 points</li>
  <li>Effective –	4 points</li>
  <li>Ineffective – 0 points</li>
</ul>

<p>A total score will then be calculated and this will be judged against the following overall criteria:</p>

<p>Total point score of more than Y (Y calculated as maximum possible score  x 0.97) = Excellent</p>

<p>Total point score of X to Y = Effective</p>

<p>Total point score of less than X (X calculated as maximum possible score* x 0.92) = Ineffective</p>

<p>The overall score for will be published at the end of the financial year.</p>
