<h2>Way to Work – Regulations</h2>

<p>Dear Stephen,</p>

<p>Following the announcement of the Government’s Way to Work campaign on 26 January 2022, I am writing to inform you I will be relying on the urgency procedure under section 173 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to introduce regulations to make and lay regulations to effect relevant policy changes around the ‘permitted period’. I intend on amending regulation 97(5) of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 and regulation 14(3)(b) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2013. These are both subject to the negative procedure.</p>

<p>I recognise and understand the important role of the Social Security Advisory Committee in their consideration of draft regulations. However, on this occasion, unfortunately, it is necessary to use these urgency provisions to make regulations without referring them to the Committee.</p>

<p>The Way to Work campaign was launched by the Prime Minister on 26 January 2022, a new drive to help half a million people currently out of work into jobs by the end of June. These regulations will reduce the maximum period for which limitations on work-related requirements for our claimants are allowed (known as the permitted period) from three months to four weeks. This will mean that claimants will be expected to broaden their job search activity more quickly into suitable jobs in any sector that they are capable of doing.</p>

<p>The urgency is necessary to allow the Department to promote opportunities in any sector for claimants immediately. Any delay could have a negative impact on my Department’s ability to achieve the target of getting half a million people into jobs by June, which is designed to help the prosperity and wellbeing of unemployed people. I also intend to set aside the 21-day rule with these regulations.</p>

<p>I consider that it is necessary to introduce these regulations urgently, as any delay could have an impact on my Department’s ability to achieve the target of getting half a million people into jobs by June. I will undertake an evaluation of the regulations at the end of June to assess their effectiveness and whether they should be retained.
I am very grateful for the Committee’s understanding in this matter. In line with the usual practice, I recognise that the regulations will still be subject to the scrutiny of the Committee after they have been laid.</p>

<p>Thérèse Coffey</p>
