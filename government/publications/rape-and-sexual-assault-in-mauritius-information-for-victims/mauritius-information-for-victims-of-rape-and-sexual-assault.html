<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Medical information has been provided by The Havens Sexual Assault Referral Centres of Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and The Rowan SARC NI and was accurate at the time of production.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention; report to local police; and engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 999 or 148 (24/7 helpline)</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-port-louis">British High Commission in Port Louis</a>. Embassy staff will be polite, patient, sensitive and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in Mauritius</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you would like assistance from the British High Commission, we will try to send a consular officer to you.</li>
  <li>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the British High Commission in Port Louis.</li>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable. In Mauritius, the police report will normally be conducted in English.</li>
  <li>Most police officers in Mauritius speak English. There will be both male and female police officers available to talk to in Mauritius if you need. Should you require an interpreter, this can be made available to you upon request.</li>
  <li>It is likely that the police will allow us to accompany you. However, accompanying you will only be for welfare basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Mauritius</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The British High Commission in Port Louis will be able to help you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK. We can provide you with lists of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mauritius-list-of-doctors">English speaking medical facilities</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mauritius-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a> and translators.</li>
  <li>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</li>
  <li>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you do not report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence.</li>
  <li>In Mauritius, crimes should be reported in person.</li>
  <li>If you do not report the crime, you may still be able to get medical examination but not a forensic examination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. If you report the incident to the Police in the UK, it is likely that the police in the UK will treat it as a complaint rather than a report of a crime.</p>

<p>It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Reporting the crime in Mauritius - what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you are reporting a crime in Mauritius, the police will take a statement/report as to what has happened and they may ask you for the description of the attacker.</li>
  <li>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. As, the police will keep any clothes which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner. They may also take your bed sheets, passports and any other clothing/ jewellery items that can be used as proof of evidence. Any personal belongings taken from you will be returned to you once an investigation has been conducted.</li>
  <li>The police will send victims to the Police Medical examination officer for medical examination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>The medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All hospitals/ private clinics in Mauritius treat victims of rape and sexual assault.</li>
  <li>The medical officer will report the medical examination to the police. For this to be done, the medical officer will request a form from the police called FORM 58. This form will allow the medical officer to write his medical statement/findings, and that statement will be taken to court as part of evidence.</li>
  <li>In Mauritius, the Chief Medical Officer carries out the medical examination. Samples or swabs will be collected from your clothes, mouth and hair. There will also be an internal examination.</li>
  <li>Consular staff can accompany you to the hospital should you so wish, but this will only be for welfare basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Treatment</h2>

<p>Local hospital/ private clinic medical staff can give you advice on “Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)” medication, a treatment that may prevent a HIV infection. This can be prescribed at any hospital. More information on risks is available on the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" rel="external">NHS website.</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on return to the UK.</li>
  <li>In Mauritius, emergency contraception can be bought from local chemists or given to you at the hospital as part of the emergency treatment. It needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. However, the hospital may ask for prescription depending on your age.</li>
  <li>Hospital care is private in Mauritius, therefore you may be asked to pay for your treatment. You can make a claim through your insurance.</li>
  <li>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Police investigations in Mauritius – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The police will take the victim to the scene of the crime for a reconstruction of the case. At this stage, the victim will not have contact with the accused to avoid post event traumatism.</li>
  <li>If the victim is taken to the police station for identification, this will be done in a room with glazed window. Therefore, the accused will not be able to see the victim, but the victim can see the accused and identify him/her.</li>
  <li>An arrest in Mauritius may take up to a few years. There is no limitation of how long this can take. In order for things to progress, the police enquiry must be complete. This information will then be passed on to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The DPP then chooses the right offence, followed by an indictment. The victim and the accused will then be called to court, and trial will start.</li>
  <li>The victim will be expected to go in front of the public prosecutor to make a statement. A lawyer may be appointed to represent a victim; however, the victim will have to be present in court. The lawyer will already have access to the victim’s notes, as this will be given to him/her by the Court/ Police.</li>
  <li>Once the case is filed, the victim can leave the country, however once trial the victim starts will have to be in country. If the victim does decide to leave country, they will have to provide the Court/ Police with a reliable postal address and contact number so that they can be informed of when trials will start.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If a suspect is ordered to trial, the victim will be expected to testify in court. This is normally done after the formal witnesses. The victim will have to testify in Mauritius, as testifying from UK can be difficult and requires approval from the Court. However, victims do not need to be present at every court session.</li>
  <li>If you do not have a lawyer, the police will notify you of your upcoming trial dates. It is up to the victim to decide whether they want a lawyer or not. The benefits of appointing a lawyer is for reassurance and the lawyer can answer all questions of witness.</li>
  <li>If the case is referred for further investigation, the victim will not have to give additional information as once the case has been fixed for trial in court, it means that the investigation is over.</li>
  <li>If the victim wishes to drop charges, they will have to write to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to say that he/she does not wish to proceed with the case. However, the DPP can still insist that the case be heard. If good reasons are given as to why the victim does not want to proceed further, the victim will not face charges for this.</li>
  <li>The accused party can bring a civil action for damages against the victim if they believe that the victim has made a false accusation. However, it is for the DPP to decide for prosecutions even if the accused has protested to the police that the accusation is false.</li>
