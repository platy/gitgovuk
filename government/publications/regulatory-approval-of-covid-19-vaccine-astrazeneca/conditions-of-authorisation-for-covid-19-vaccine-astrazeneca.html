  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This authorisation is not a marketing authorisation for the purposes of Part 5 of the HMRs or Chapter 4 of Title III to the 2001 Directive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This authorisation applies to the supply within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As provided in Regulation 174A(2) of the Human Medicine Regulations, the sale or supply of this vaccine will not be deemed to be licensed or approved under this Authorisation if the supply is for the purpose of any use other than the recommended or required use, or if a condition in this authorisation is breached (including the conditions of use incorporated into this Authorisation).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entities responsible for physically supplying the product in the United Kingdom are AstraZeneca AB, SE-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden and AstraZeneca PLC, 1 Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge CB2 0AA. These two entities (hereinafter AZ) will be jointly and separately responsible for placing the product on the market in the United Kingdom for the purposes of The Human Medicines Regulations including Regulation 345(3).</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AZ must respond in a timely manner to any requests from the MHRA for further supplementary data or requirements relating to the product. AZ must provide relevant additional data regarding drug product manufacturing process, product quality, non-clinical and clinical data reasonably requested by MHRA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any deviations from any of these conditions can only be made with the prior agreement of the MHRA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
