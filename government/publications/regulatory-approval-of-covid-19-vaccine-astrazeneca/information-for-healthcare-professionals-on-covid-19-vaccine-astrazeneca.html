<h2>Summary of Product Characteristics</h2>

<p>This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section  4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Name of the medicinal product</h2>

<p>Vaxzevria, suspension for injection</p>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1 S [recombinant])</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Qualitative and quantitative composition</h2>

<p>For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Pharmaceutical form</h2>

<p>Suspension for injection.</p>

<p>The suspension is colourless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque with a pH of 6.6.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Clinical particulars</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Therapeutic indications</h3>

<p>Vaxzevria is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals â¥18 years old.</p>

<p>The use of Vaxzevria should be in accordance with official recommendations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Posology and method of administration</h3>

<h4>Posology</h4>

<h4>Individuals 18 years of age and older</h4>
<p>The Vaxzevria primary vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each. The second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 weeks after the first dose (see section 5.1).</p>

<p>A booster dose (third dose) of 0.5 ml may be given to individuals who previously received a 2 dose primary vaccination course with Vaxzevria. The third dose may be administered at least 6 months after completing the primary vaccination course. The decision when and for whom to implement a third dose of Vaxzevria should be made based on available vaccine effectiveness data, taking into account limited safety data (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p>

<p>There are no data available on the interchangeability of Vaxzevria with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination course. Individuals who have received a first dose of Vaxzevria should receive a second dose of Vaxzevria to complete the primary vaccination course and for any additional doses.</p>

<h4>Elderly population</h4>

<p>No dosage adjustment is required. See sections 4.4 and 5.1.</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The safety and efficacy of Vaxzevria in children and adolescents (aged &lt;18 years old) have not yet been established. No data are available.</p>

<h4>Method of administration</h4>

<p>Vaxzevria is for intramuscular (IM) injection only, preferably in the deltoid muscle.</p>

<p>The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.</p>

<p>For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.</p>

<p>For instructions on administration, see section 6.6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Contraindications</h3>

<p>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p>

<p>Individuals who have experienced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following vaccination with Vaxzevria. (see section 4.2).</p>

<p>Individuals who have previously experienced episodes of capillary leak syndrome (see also section 4.4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>	Special warnings and precautions for use</h3>

<h4>Traceability</h4>

<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<h4>Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis</h4>

<p>Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema have occurred following administration of Vaxzevria. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.</p>

<p>An additional dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction to a previous dose of Vaxzevria.</p>

<h4>Anxiety-related reactions</h4>
<p>Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.</p>

<h4>Concurrent illness</h4>

<h4>Coagulation disorders</h4>

<p>As with other vaccines, administration of Vaxzevria should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as cold, and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.</p>

<h4>Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome</h4>

<p>Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria. This includes severe cases presenting as venous thrombosis, including unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis, concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Some cases had a fatal outcome. The majority of these cases occurred within the first 3 weeks following vaccination but have also been reported after this period. The reporting rates have been lower after the second dose than after the first dose. Risk factors have not been identified. Some cases had increased D-dimer levels &gt;4000ng/ml, positive platelet factor 4 antibodies and/or laboratory evidence of platelet activation.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, administration of the Vaxzevria in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT or HIT type 2) or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should only be considered when the benefit outweighs any potential risks.</p>

<p>TTS requires specialised clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g., haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this condition.</p>

<p>Cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis: Events of cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis without thrombocytopenia have been observed very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Some cases had a fatal outcome. The majority of these cases occurred within the first four weeks following vaccination. This information should be considered for individuals at increased risk for cerebrovascular venous and sinus thrombosis. These events may require different treatment approaches than TTS and healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance.</p>

<h4>Thrombocytopenia</h4>

<p>Cases of thrombocytopenia, including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been reported after receiving Vaxzevria, typically within the first four weeks after vaccination. Very rarely, these presented with very low platelet levels (&lt;20,000 per ÂµL) and/or were associated with bleeding. Cases with fatal outcome have been reported. Some of these cases occurred in individuals with a history of immune thrombocytopenia. If an individual has a history of a thrombocytopenic disorder, such as immune thrombocytopenia, the risk of developing low platelet levels should be considered before administering the vaccine and platelet monitoring is recommended after vaccination.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia. Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if four or more days after vaccination they develop new onset or worsening severe or persistent headaches with blurred vision, which do not respond to simple painkillers, or if they develop new symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain, persistent abdominal pain, any neurological symptoms or signs such as confusion or seizures, or if they experience spontaneous bleeding, unusual skin bruising and/or petechiae beyond the site of vaccination.</p>

<p>Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia within three weeks after vaccination with Vaxzevria should be actively investigated for signs of thrombosis. Similarly, individuals who present with thrombosis within three weeks of vaccination should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia.</p>

<h4>Risk of bleeding with intramuscular administration</h4>

<p>As with other intramuscular injections, Vaxzevria should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia, any coagulation disorder or to persons on anticoagulation therapy, because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.</p>

<h4>Capillary leak syndrome</h4>
<p>Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported in the first days after vaccination with Vaxzevria. A history of CLS was apparent in some of the cases. Fatal outcome has been reported. CLS is a rare disorder characterised by acute episodes of oedema mainly affecting the limbs, hypotension, haemoconcentration and hypoalbuminaemia. Patients with an acute episode of CLS following vaccination require prompt recognition and treatment. Intensive supportive therapy is usually warranted. Individuals with a known history of CLS should not be vaccinated with this vaccine. See also section 4.3.</p>

<h4>Neurological events</h4>

<p>Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS) has been reported very rarely following vaccination with Vaxzevria. Healthcare professionals should be alert of GBS signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment, and to rule out other causes.</p>

<h4>Immunocompromised individuals</h4>

<p>The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Vaxzevria may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.</p>

<h4>Duration and level of protection</h4>

<p>The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<h4>Limitations of vaccine effectiveness</h4>
<p>Protection starts from approximately 3 weeks after the first dose of Vaxzevria. Individuals may not be fully protected until 15 days after the second dose is administered. As with all vaccines, vaccination with Vaxzevria may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1).</p>

<h4>Excipients</h4>

<h5>Sodium</h5>
<p>This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be essentially sodium-free.</p>

<h5>Ethanol</h5>
<p>This medicinal product contains 2 mg of alcohol (ethanol) per 0.5 ml dose. The small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable effects.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</h3>

<p>No interaction studies have been performed.</p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Vaxzevria with other vaccines has not been studied (see section 5.1).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h3>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4>

<p>There is a limited experience with the use of Vaxzevria in pregnant women.</p>

<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/fetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</p>

<p>Administration of COVIDâ19 Vaccine AstraZeneca during pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks (including those described in sections 4.4 and 4.8) for the mother and fetus.</p>

<h4>Breastfeeding</h4>

<p>It is unknown whether Vaxzevria is excreted in human milk.</p>

<h4>Fertility</h4>

<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Effects on ability to drive and use machines</h3>

<p>Vaxzevria has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the adverse reactions mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Undesirable effects</h3>

<h4>Summary of the safety profile</h4>

<p>The overall safety of Vaxzevria is based on an analysis of pooled data from four clinical trials phase I/II, II/III and III conducted in the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa, and of data from an additional phase III clinical trial conducted in the United States, Peru and Chile. At the time of analysis, a total of 56,124  participants â¥18 years old had been randomised and of these, 33,869 participants received at least one dose of COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and 31,217 received 2 doses.</p>

<p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions are injection site tenderness (68%), injection site pain (58%), headache (53%), fatigue (53%), myalgia (44%), malaise (44%), pyrexia (includes feverishness (33%) and fever â¥38Â°C (8%)), chills (32%), arthralgia (27%) and nausea (22%). The majority of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and usually resolved within a few days of vaccination.</p>

<p>Very rare cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome have been reported post-marketing within the first three weeks following vaccination (see section 4.4).</p>

<p>When compared with the first dose, adverse reactions reported after the second dose were milder and reported less frequently. The reactogenicity observed in 80 subjects who received a booster dose (third dose) 6 â 8 months after a 2-dose primary vaccination course was consistent with the known reactogenicity profile of Vaxzevria and was lower than that of the first dose.</p>

<p>Reactogenicity events were generally milder and reported less frequently in older adults (â¥65 years old).</p>

<p>If required, analgesic and/or anti-pyretic medicinal products (e.g. paracetamol-containing products) may be used to provide symptomatic relief from post-vaccination adverse reactions.</p>

<p>The safety profile was consistent across participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline; the number of seropositive participants at baseline was 753 (3.1%).</p>

<h4>Tabulated list of adverse reactions</h4>

<p>The safety profile presented below is based on an analysis of data from five clinical trials which included participants â¥18 years old (pooled data from four clinical trials conducted in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa, and data from one clinical trial conducted in the United States, Peru and Chile) and on data from post-authorisation experience.</p>

<p>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are organised by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Within each SOC, preferred terms are arranged by decreasing frequency and then by decreasing seriousness. Frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions are defined as: very common (â¥1/10); common (â¥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (â¥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (â¥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).</p>

<h3>Post-authorisation reports of influenza-like illness</h3>
<p>Some recipients have reported chills, shivering (in some cases rigors), and increased body temperature possibly with sweating, headache (including migraine-like headaches), nausea, myalgia and malaise, starting within a day of vaccination. These effects usually lasted for a day or two.</p>

<p>If a patient reports unusually high or prolonged fever, or other symptoms, alternative causes should be considered and appropriate advice should be provided for diagnostic investigation and medical management as required.</p>

<h3>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h3>

<p>If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow Card. Reporting forms and information can be found at the <a href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site</a> search for MHRA Yellow Card in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard&amp;referrer=utm_source%3DEYC%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26anid%3Dadmob" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Google Play</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id990237487?pt=117756671&amp;ct=EYC&amp;mt=8" class="govuk-link">Apple App Store</a> and include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with Vaxzevria can be reported to AstraZeneca on 08000 541 028 or via the <a rel="external" href="https://www.azcovid-19.com/" class="govuk-link">AstraZeneca website</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between AstraZeneca and the MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>

<p>There is no specific treatment for an overdose with Vaxzevria. In the event of an overdose, the individual should be monitored and provided with symptomatic treatment as appropriate.</p>

<span class="number">5.1 </span> 	Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>

<p>Vaxzevria is a monovalent vaccine composed of a single recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) vector encoding the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is expressed locally stimulating neutralising antibody and cellular immune responses.</p>

<h4>Clinical efficacy</h4>

<h4>Pooled analysis from studies COV001/COV002/COV003/COV005</h4>

<p>Vaxzevria has been evaluated based on an interim analysis of pooled data from four on-going randomised, blinded, controlled trials: a Phase I/II Study, COV001, in healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age in the UK; a Phase II/III Study, COV002, in adults â¥18 years of age (including the elderly) in the UK; a Phase III Study, COV003, in adults â¥18 years of age (including the elderly) in Brazil; and a Phase I/II study, COV005, in adults aged 18 to 65 years of age in South Africa. The studies excluded participants with history of anaphylaxis or angioedema; participants with severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, endocrine/metabolic disease, and neurological illnesses; as well as those with immunosuppression. In studies COV001 and COV002, licensed seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were permitted (at least 7 days before or after their study vaccine).</p>

<p>All participants are planned to be followed for up to 12 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19 disease.</p>

<p>Based on the pre-defined criteria for interim efficacy analysis, COV002 and COV003 exceeded the threshold of â¥5 virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases per study and therefore contributed to the efficacy analysis; COV001 and COV005 were excluded.</p>

<p>In the pooled analysis for efficacy (COV002 and COV003), participants â¥18 years of age and seronegative at baseline received two doses of Vaxzevria (N=5,807) or control (meningococcal vaccine or saline) (N=5,829). Because of logistical constraints, the interval between dose 1 and dose 2 ranged from 4 to 26 weeks.</p>

<p>Baseline demographics were well balanced across Vaxzevria and control treatment groups. Overall, among the participants who received Vaxzevria, 94.1% of participants were 18 to 64 years old (with 5.9% aged 65 or older); 60.7% of subjects were female; 82.8% were White, 4.6% were Asian, and 4.4% were Black. A total of 2,070 (35.6%) participants had at least one pre-existing comorbidity (defined as a BMI â¥30 kg/m2, cardiovascular disorder, respiratory disease or diabetes). The median follow-up time post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 was 132 days and 63 days, respectively.</p>

<p>Final determination of COVID-19 cases were made by an adjudication committee, who also assigned disease severity according to the WHO clinical progression scale. A total of 131 participants had SARS-CoV-2 virologically confirmed (by nucleic acid amplification tests) COVID-19 occurring â¥15 days post dose 2 with at least one COVID-19 symptom (objective fever (defined as â¥37.8Â°C), cough, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia) and were without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaxzevria significantly decreased the incidence of COVID-19 compared to control.</p>

<p>An updated efficacy analysis included 17,178 participants from all four studies. Among the participants who received Vaxzevria, 83.8% were 18 to 55 years old, 10.5% were 56 to 69 years old and 5.6% were aged 70 or older. The median follow-up time post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 was 143 days and 83 days, respectively. The results of these analyses, interim and updated efficacy analyses, are presented in Table 2.</p>

<p>In the interim analysis, participants who had one or more comorbidities had a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 73.4% [95% CI: 48.5; 86.3]; 11 (0.5%) vs 43 (2.0%) cases of COVID-19 for Vaxzevria (N=2,070) and control (N=2,113), respectively; which was similar to the VE observed in the overall population. In the updated analysis, the VE in this subgroup of participants with one or more comorbidities was 62.7% (95% CI: 44.8; 74.8 [Vaxzevria 34/3,056 vs control 93/3,102]).</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19 cases in participants â¥65 years old were too few to draw conclusions on efficacy. However, in this subpopulation, immunogenicity data are available, see below. In the interim analysis there were 2 cases of COVID-19 in 660 participants. In the updated analysis, there were 12 cases in 1,383 participants (4 for Vaxzevria vs 8 for control; VE = 51.9% [95% CI: -60.0, 85.5]). The majority of participants â¥65 years old received their doses with an interval shorter than 6 weeks.</p>

<p>The level of protection gained from a single dose of Vaxzevria was assessed in an exploratory analysis that included participants who had received one dose. Participants were censored from the analysis at the earliest time point of when they received a second dose or at 12 weeks post dose 1. In this population, VE from 22 days post dose 1 was 73.0% (95% CI: 48.8; 85.8 [Vaxzevria 12/7,998 vs control 44/7,982]). In the updated analysis, this was 69.2% (95% CI: 48.5; 82.4 [Vaxzevria 20/11,044 vs control 65/11,015]).</p>

<p>Exploratory analyses showed that increased immunogenicity was associated with a longer dose interval (see Immunogenicity Table 5). Efficacy results from subgroup analyses using the updated dataset were consistent with the immunogenicity data (Table 3).</p>

<h4>Study D8110C00001</h4>

<p>The clinical efficacy of Vaxzevria has been evaluated based on an analysis of Study D8110C00001: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III study conducted in the United States, Peru and Chile. The study excluded participants with severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, endocrine/metabolic disease, and neurological illnesses; as well as those with severe immunosuppression, pregnant women and participants with a known history of SARS CoV 2 infection. All participants are planned to be followed for up to 12 months, for assessments of efficacy against COVID-19 disease.</p>

<p>Participants â¥18 years of age received two doses (5 Ã 1010 viral particles per dose corresponding to not less than 2.5 Ã 108 infectious units) of Vaxzevria (N=17,662) or saline placebo (N=8,550), administered via IM injection on Day 1 and Day 29 (-3 to +7 days). The median dose interval was 29 days and the majority of participants (95.7% and 95.3% for Vaxzevria and placebo, respectively) received the second dose â¥26 to â¤36 days after dose 1.</p>

<p>Baseline demographics were well balanced across the Vaxzevria and placebo groups. Of the participants who received Vaxzevria, 79.1% were aged 18 to 64 years (with 20.9% aged 65 or older) and 43.8% of subjects were female. Of those randomised, 79.3% were White, 7.9% were Black, 4.2% were Asian, 4.2% were American Indian or Alaska Native. A total of 10,376 (58.8%) participants had at least one pre-existing comorbidity, defined as: chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower immune health because of a solid organ transplant, history of obesity (BMI &gt;30), serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, asthma, dementia, cerebrovascular diseases, cystic fibrosis, high blood pressure, liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis, thalassemia or history of smoking. At the time of analysis the median follow up time post dose 2 was 61 days.</p>

<p>Final determination of COVID-19 cases was made by an adjudication committee. Overall vaccine efficacy and efficacy by key age groups are presented in Table 4.</p>

<p>(b) The confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity.</p>

<p>Severe or critical symptomatic COVID-19 illness was assessed as a key secondary endpoint. Among all subjects in the per protocol set, no cases of severe or critical symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group compared with 8 cases reported in the placebo group. There were 9 hospitalised cases, the 8 cases that were adjudicated as severe or critical symptomatic COVID-19, and one additional case in the vaccine group. The majority of the severe or critical symptomatic COVID-19 cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (â¤ 93% on room air).</p>

<p>In individuals with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the vaccine efficacy of Vaxzevria (â¥15 days post-dose 2) was 73.7% (95% CI: 63.1; 80.1); 76 (0.4%) vs 135 (1.5%) cases of COVID-19 for Vaxzevria (N=18,563) and placebo (N=9,031), respectively.</p>

<p>Participants with one or more comorbidities who received Vaxzevria had an efficacy (â¥15 days post-dose 2) of 75.2% (95% CI: 64.2; 82.9) and participants without comorbidities had a vaccine efficacy of 71.8% (95% CI: 55.5, 82.1).</p>

<h4>Immunogenicity</h4>

<p>Following vaccination with Vaxzevria, in participants who were seronegative at baseline, seroconversion (as measured by a â¥4 fold increase from baseline in S-binding antibodies) was demonstrated in â¥98% of participants at 28 days after the first dose and &gt;99% at 28 days after the second. Higher S-binding antibodies were observed with increasing dose interval (Table 4).</p>

<p>Generally similar trends were observed between analyses of neutralising antibodies and S-binding antibodies. An immunological correlate of protection has not been established; therefore, the level of immune response that provides protection against COVID-19 is unknown.</p>

The increase in S binding antibodies 28 days after second dose was lower for participants â¥65 years old (GMT=19,258.5 [N=161, 95% CI: 16,650.4; 22,275.1]) when compared to participants aged 18 64 years (GMT=32,337.1 [N=1,350, 95% CI: 30,720.8; 34,038.4]). The majority of participants â¥65 years old had a dose interval of &lt;6 weeks, which may have contributed to the lower titres observed.</p>

<p>In participants with serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (GMT=10,979.1 [N=36; 95% CI: 6,452.7; 18,680.5]), S-antibody titres peaked 28 days after dose 1 (GMT=139,010.4 [N=35; 95% CI: 95,429.0; 202,495.1]) but did not increase further after the second dose.</p>

<p>Spike-specific T cell responses as measured by IFN É£ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay were induced after a first dose of Vaxzevria. These did not rise further after a second dose.</p>

<h4>Immunogenicity data in individuals receiving a booster dose (third dose)</h4>

<p>In a substudy of COV001, antibody responses were assessed after the second and third dose in 73 participants aged 18-55 years who had received their two doses of the primary vaccination course within an 8-16 week interval, followed by a booster dose between 28-38 weeks after the second dose. Spike IgG antibody titres after the booster dose were significantly higher than after the second dose: the geometric mean [95% CI] total IgG titre was 1926 Elisa Units [1465, 2534] at 28 days after the second dose vs 3495 EUs [2833, 4312] 28 days after the booster dose (Wilcoxon signed rank test p=0.0043).</p>

<h4>Unopened multidose vial</h4>

<p>6 months</p>

<p>The following information is intended to guide healthcare professionals only in case of an unforeseen temporary temperature excursion. It is not a recommended storage or shipping condition.</p>

<p>The shelf-life of unopened vials includes the following unforeseen excursions from refrigerated storage (2Â°C â 8Â°C) for a single period of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>12 hours up to 30Â°C</li>
  <li>72 hours down to -3Â°C</li>
</ul>

<p>Unopened vials must always be returned to refrigerated storage (2ÂºC to 8ÂºC) following an unforeseen temperature excursion.</p>

<p>The occurrence of an unforeseen temperature excursion for unopened vials does not impact how the vials should be stored after first opening (first vial puncture).</p>

<h4>After first use</h4>

<p>Use as soon as practically possible and within 6 hours. The vaccine may be stored between 2Â°C and 25Â°C during the in-use period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Special precautions for storage</h3>

<h4>Unopened multidose vial</h4>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> Special precautions for disposal and other handling</h3>

<h4>Handling instructions and administration</h4>
<p>This vaccine should be handled by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique to ensure the sterility of each dose. The vaccine does not contain any preservative.</p>

<p>Do not use this vaccine after the expiry date which is stated on the label after EXP. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.</p>

<p>Unopened multidose vial should be stored in a refrigerator (2Â°C to 8Â°C). Do not freeze.</p>

<p>Keep the vials in outer carton in order to protect from light.</p>

<p>Vaxzevria is a colourless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque suspension. The vaccine should be inspected visually prior to administration and discarded if particulate matter or differences in the described appearance are observed. Do not shake the vial. Do not dilute the suspension.</p>

<p>The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.</p>

<p>The vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each. The second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 weeks after the first dose. Individuals who have received the first dose of Vaxzevria should receive the second dose of the same vaccine to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<p>Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml is withdrawn into a syringe for injection to be administered intramuscularly, preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. Each vial contains at least the number of doses stated. It is normal for liquid to remain in the vial after withdrawing the final dose. When low dead volume syringes and/or needles are used, the amount remaining in the vial may be sufficient for an additional dose. Care should be taken to ensure a full 0.5 ml dose is administered. Where a full 0.5 ml dose cannot be extracted, the remaining volume should be discarded. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.</p>

<p>After first dose withdrawal, use the vial as soon as practically possible and within 6 hours (stored at 2Â°C to 25Â°C). Discard any unused vaccine.</p>

<p>To facilitate the traceability of the vaccine, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded for each recipient.</p>

<h4>Disposal</h4>

<p>Vaxzevria contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. Spills should be disinfected using agents with activity against adenovirus.</p>
