<h2>Chapter A: Overview</h2>

<h3>A.1 Provisional estimates</h3>

<p>Error and fraud estimation is of critical importance to support <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s strategic and operational compliance approach.</p>

<p>Given the critical nature of the pandemic and the public interest in the support schemes, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> have taken the exceptional action to assess and report error and fraud very early on for all COVID-19 support schemes, using best available evidence. Early development of these provisional estimates has supported policy development and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s compliance response at this unprecedented time.</p>

<p>We publish our provisional estimates in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-annual-report-and-accounts-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Annual Report and Accounts 2020 to 2021</a>. This paper provides further breakdowns of those provisional estimates and sets out in detail the data sources and methodology.</p>

<p>These estimates show that the vast majority of employers and the self-employed got things right. There is evidence of the positive impact of controls to prevent abuse of the schemes by organised crime. The estimates also show a reduction in error and fraud over time for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>).</p>

<p>These are provisional estimates. We are expecting more complete sets of data which will allow us to provide final estimates of error and fraud for the relevant schemes which will be published in due course.</p>

<p>Further detail on our compliance response on the COVID-19 schemes is documented in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h3>A.2 Key findings</h3>

<p>Our latest provisional estimates show some clear trends and insights into the COVID-19 schemes’ error and fraud - see <a href="#appendix-1" class="govuk-link">Appendix 1</a>.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The assessment of losses from organised crime are low. This reflects the effective design choices and pre-payment controls preventing systematic abuse.</li>
  <li>Overall, the latest provisional estimate range for error and fraud is slightly higher than initial planning assumptions: a range of 6.7% to 12%, compared to the initial planning assumption of 5 to 10%. However, the most likely value of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> error and fraud in the latest assessments is 8.7%, still well within the original range. The provisional estimate is based on the best available evidence at the time, which is rated by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> as ‘mild’, meaning there is uncertainty to the estimate and a high probability that the figures will be revised in future, upon receipt of further information.</li>
  <li>We estimate that error and fraud rates reduced between the different periods of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme (<a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>, Table A3).</li>
  <li>Error and fraud was found to be highest in the first period (March to June 2020) of the scheme, particularly because of the risk from employers claiming <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> for employees who are working. This is because in the first period of the scheme the eligibility criteria excluded furloughed employees who did any work, whereas the scheme became more flexible from July 2020 onwards to allow part-furloughed employees to qualify. The same behaviours that could be non-compliant in the first period of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> can therefore be compliant or only partially non-compliant in the later periods of the scheme.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first, second and third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As with <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, losses from organised crime in <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> are also low – again reflecting the effective design and pre-payment controls.</li>
  <li>Overall, error and fraud in <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> is lower than in <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> because <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> were less reliant on claimants assessing their entitlement and were able to determine entitlement from data the department already held.</li>
  <li>The previous error and fraud range for the first, second and third <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants together was between below 1% to 2%. The latest provisional estimates are higher, at a range from 1.8% to 3.2%. The most likely value in the latest provisional estimate is 2.5%. The provisional estimate is based on the best available evidence at the time, which was adequate overall, with elements of mild evidence meaning there is some uncertainty to the estimate.</li>
  <li>In the latest provisional estimates, we see a slight decline in the level of error and fraud as <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> moves from the first grant to the second grant and then to the third. This is mainly a result of a decrease in the organised crime component, reflecting the extra information <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has collected during the lifetime of the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> scheme to improve the effectiveness of pre-payment controls.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Eat Out to Help Out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is the first time a provisional estimate has been published for Eat Out to Help Out. The range for Eat Out to Help Out error and fraud is from 5.1% to 11.8%, with a most likely point value of 8.5%. This is within the range expected when the scheme was designed, where the planning assumption was 5% to 10%. The provisional estimate is based on the best available evidence at the time, which was mild meaning there is uncertainty to the estimate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chapter B: methodology</h2>

<h3>B.1 How the analysis develops</h3>

<p>The department’s work to measure error and fraud falls into 3 broad categories from the earliest planning assumptions through to more refined estimates of error and fraud:</p>

<p>a) Initial planning assumptions – our earliest work to support the design and launch of the schemes. These are broad assessments of potential error and fraud created at relatively high speed to inform policy development and initial operational planning. Planning assumptions build in as much evidence as available at the time but by their nature are typically quite uncertain. For example, operational and policy intelligence may be the only data available at this stage.</p>

<p>b) Provisional estimates – more advanced work, bringing in further data and information as it exists to provide greater certainty compared to the initial planning assumptions. Provisional estimates draw on a wider and deeper evidence base as stronger evidence becomes available.  This is the stage we are currently at and what we present in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020 to 2021 and in this supporting document.</p>

<p>c) Full estimates – the most robust level of analysis possible for each scheme, using full outturn information available and data for the relevant time period.</p>

<p>In order to produce the final estimates, we are actively improving the evidence.  For <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> we are conducting a random enquiry programme and we will also gain operational data from completed risk-based compliance interventions. This means that we aim to produce refined <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> estimates towards the first part of 2022. For <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>, we will expect to be able to refine the error and fraud estimates when the full year of 2020 to 2021 Self Assessment data becomes available in early 2022. Given that the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was a short-term intervention which is now closed, we do not expect significant new data or information to become available and we are therefore not expecting to update the error and fraud estimates for this scheme.</p>

<p>To balance the need to provide support to individuals as soon as possible with the need to mitigate the risks of error and fraud, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> developed a control framework and put a range of measures in place to protect the schemes against abuse from organised criminal attacks and non-compliance by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>designing compliance into the schemes to prevent incorrect or fraudulent claims, such as using information that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> already held</li>
  <li>promoting, good compliance through education and customer support</li>
  <li>carrying our pre-payment checks on high-risk claims, blocking payment and rejecting claims where appropriate</li>
  <li>risk assessing paid claims and, where specific risks were detected, nudging claimants to review their claims and voluntarily repay any overpaid grants</li>
  <li>carrying out post-payment checks on selected claims and enforcing recovery of overpaid grants where necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>The latest provisional estimates are on a “residual” basis. We define residual error and fraud analysis as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using the scheme designs and rules</li>
  <li>taking account of pre-payment compliance checks and activities</li>
  <li>but not yet including the results of any post-payment compliance activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our provisional estimates of residual error and fraud in this document are expressed as percentages of total scheme claims for the 2020 to 2021 financial year.</p>

<h3>B.2 Categorising and defining error and fraud in COVID-19 schemes</h3>

<p>The starting point for developing our provisional estimates was to identify specific risks for the scheme in question, taking into account scheme design. For all schemes, at the highest level these are structured into broad compliance themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organised crime</li>
  <li>opportunistic fraud</li>
  <li>error</li>
</ul>

<p>Each component has been estimated separately, as different risks have been identified and quantified for each category.</p>

<p>a) Organised crime: The COVID-19 schemes were developed at pace. Even so, compliance controls were put in place from the beginning to protect the system from criminal attacks and ensure that the grants reached only genuine claimants. Lists of known and suspect organisations/devices were matched to claims as part of pre-payment checks. The impact of this pre-payment activity is included in this estimate, and it helps to inform part of the organised crime component.</p>

<p>b) Opportunistic fraud: The opportunistic fraud component looks at scenarios identified as risky and we look to find evidence for incorrect payments from survey evidence, fraud hotline data or by identifying unusual patterns in data compared with what would be expected for that population.</p>

<p>c) Error: The error component is defined as the error that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and/or the claimant has made in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s or the claimant’s favour. The data available is <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> administrative data. As more data from compliance activities becomes available, the methodology will be improved to reflect the new insights.</p>

<p>These headline risks are broken down further into specific risk sub types (components) which are outlined in the following chapters of this report.</p>

<p>The components of the error and fraud are summed to a risk level and we present our results on this basis in <a href="#appendix-1" class="govuk-link">Appendix 1</a>.</p>

<p>We determine the most likely, lower and upper estimates for each scheme. The following sections of this chapter detail how we account for uncertainty in our error and fraud data model.</p>

<h3>B.3 Creating a data model for estimation</h3>

<p>There are 2 factors that affect the robustness of our estimates:</p>

<p>a) the availability and quality of data</p>

<p>b) the quality of the data modelling techniques applied where evidence is not statistically sound</p>

<h3>B.3.1 Data availability and quality overview and strength of evidence</h3>

<p>Input data to our models varies in terms of availability and robustness. We use the best available evidence to us to build assumptions and parameters around each risk. We account for the strength of the evidence available in our modelling.</p>

<p>In the absence of complete relevant data for the liability period 2020 to 2021, and full compliance information, which provides the strongest level of evidence, we have made best use of mild data to deliver these provisional estimates. Where possible we combine evidence to corroborate milder evidence sources or utilised qualitative techniques to inform our assessment about suitability and reliability of the evidence.</p>

<h4>Evidence level – strong</h4>

<p>We define this level of evidence to be where good quality specifically collected for the measure, either drawn from random sampling or drawn from historic scheme-specific management information is available, with minimal extrapolation or adjustment required. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>results from a recent and relevant random enquiry programme, where taxpayers are selected at random for a post-payment compliance audit to enable us to understand the scale of any incorrect claims - the random based sampling allows us to take an unbiased view of the underlying non-compliance in a population</li>
  <li>a recent survey of sufficiently large random sample of scheme specific customers</li>
  <li>findings from recent and relevant tax returns by either all or sufficiently large random sample of scheme specific population</li>
  <li>management information from operational risking and testing covering the whole sub-set of customers</li>
</ul>

<p>This is good quality data and should be presented as such, including as a basis for comparison with external estimates or to make strategic decisions with more confidence.</p>

<h4>Evidence level – adequate</h4>

<p>This evidence is largely based on relevant operational MI but relying on substantial adjustment or extrapolation to the data in order to make most likely estimates, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>results from a historic Random Enquiry Programme covering a closely relevant population</li>
  <li>management information from operational risking from a previous version of the scheme</li>
  <li>extrapolation based on a sufficiently large non-random sample from a relevant population</li>
  <li>results being up to moderately sensitive to the parameters drawn from the evidence</li>
  <li>findings from closely related data with adequate or strong levels of evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>Data should be treated with some caution and presented with appropriate caveats. We would seek operational sign-off and rely on expert judgement to test the adjustments made or look for further corroborating evidence. Estimates may change with iteration and receipt of further data.</p>

<h4>Evidence level – mild</h4>

<p>Evidence is largely assumption-based estimates, based on expert opinion or drawing on operational MI; high-level statistics; nearest analogous compliance process or risk for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data applied from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s internal strategic tax compliance information sources</li>
  <li>data from a historic survey of relevant population</li>
  <li>findings based on poor quality data</li>
  <li>results being significantly sensitive to the parameters drawn from the evidence</li>
  <li>extrapolation based on a small sample of relevant population</li>
  <li>purely assumption-based or based on expert opinion</li>
</ul>

<p>Data should be treated with caution and presented with clear caveats setting out the limitations of the data. We seek sign-off from compliance experts for all holding assumptions made. Where possible we will seek to improve the evidence to improve the confidence in the data. Estimates most likely to change on receipt of further data.</p>

<h3>B.3.2 Data modelling: reflecting uncertainty</h3>

<p>The figures presented in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Annual Report and Accounts 2020 to 2021 inevitably contain sources of uncertainty due to the quality and availability of data. We account for the strength of the evidence available in our modelling.</p>

<p>In the case of mild and adequate evidence sources we acknowledge uncertainty by utilising an appropriate input range for the assumption rather than a point estimate.</p>

<p>Particularly with mild evidence, ranges can vary widely, so we apply statistical techniques to help inform the overall uncertainty ranges and to manage extreme scenarios within the underlying evidence.</p>

<p>For this analysis we chose Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability of different outcomes and to give us more confidence in our estimates. Through this technique we simulate 95% confidence intervals based on the range estimates of the average input parameters.</p>

<p>While we attempt to capture all reasonable possibilities within our input ranges, where we have classified the evidence base as mild, this does mean there is a greater possibility that estimates could be revised up or down including outside the simulated 95% confidence interval range presented, on receipt of improved evidence.</p>

<p>We derive ranges of error and fraud in percentage terms based on the total claims and the Monte Carlo simulation to derive a lower, most likely and upper estimate for each scheme.</p>

<h2>Chapter C: <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> provisional estimate</h2>

<p>In 2020 to 2021 <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> consisted of three grant time periods (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>, Table A3): There were some differences in the rules of the schemes through those periods. To assess the level of non-compliance we use all the data available to us in April 2021.</p>

<p>Our main data sources for error and fraud in the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Real Time Information (RTI) data</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claim data</li>
  <li>surveys/analysis carried out by external bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>The current level of evidence for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> estimate is mild. While each component has a different level of evidence, we establish that the overall evidence level to support the provisional estimate of error and fraud in <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> as mild.</p>

<p>In this chapter we document the components used to derive the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> error and fraud estimate.</p>

<h3>C.1 Organised crime</h3>

<p>To estimate the level of losses, we analyse the volume of payments made where there is a possibility that risk remains following <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pre-payment checks. Note, where a risk remains, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> monitor the claim further and where necessary follow up with post payment checks.</p>

<h3>C.2 Inflated genuine claims</h3>

<p>There is a risk that employers claiming for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> scheme may inflate their employee’s pay to claim a higher payment than they are entitled to.  <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> analysts analysed several hundred thousand claims to identify claims that are considerably higher than expected.</p>

<h3>C.3 Employers claiming for employees who are working</h3>

<p>This form of non-compliance refers to employees completing any types of work not permitted by the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> rules for their employer while on a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claim. We use several survey sources alongside <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> administrative data to assess this risk.</p>

<h3>C.4 Non-payment or underpayment of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant from employers to employees</h3>

<p>There is evidence that employees have not always been paid the full amount expected from being included on a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claim. We use a combination of survey and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> intelligence sources to understand this risk.</p>

<h3>C.5 Contrived insolvency</h3>

<p>This risk is defined as claiming <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> with no intention of paying employees and is combined with dissolution of the company thereafter. We use <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data and insolvency data to estimate this risk.</p>

<h3>C.6 Error (claimant favour)</h3>

<p>Building on the methodology to estimate the inflated genuine claims risk, we use administrative data sources to estimate this risk.  This also includes cases where employments claimed for did not reach the minimum three consecutive weeks of furlough, which was a requirement for claims during the first <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant phase.</p>

<h3>C.7 Error (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> favour)</h3>

<p>In absence of fully worked and reported operational compliance cases, we use the same ratio as reported in Tax Credit error and fraud as a proxy for the split between <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and claimant favour.</p>

<h2>Chapter D: <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> provisional estimates</h2>

<p>Our main data sources for error and fraud in the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income Tax Self Assessment tax return data</li>
  <li>results of pre-claim, pre-payment and post-payment compliance activities</li>
  <li>surveys/analysis carried out by other bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>The current level of evidence for this estimate is mild to adequate. While each component has a different level of evidence, we establish that the overall evidence level to support the provisional estimate of error and fraud in <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> as adequate overall, with elements of mild evidence.</p>

<p>In this chapter we document the components accounted for in the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> error and fraud estimate.</p>

<h3>D.1 Organised crime</h3>

<p>In order to estimate the level of losses, we analyse the volume of payments made where there is a possibility that risk remains following <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pre-payment checks. Note, where a risk remains, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> monitor the claim further and where necessary follow up with post payment checks.</p>

<h3>D.2 No longer trading or intending to trade</h3>

<p>This risk is where the self-employed declared fraudulently that they were trading or intending to trade at the time they claimed the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. Data from 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 Self Assessment returns have been analysed and used as proxy to understand their trading position in the pandemic year.</p>

<h3>D.3 Filing a 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment return after the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> announcement</h3>

<p>The self-employed were given the chance to submit their Self Assessment return for 4 weeks after the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant was first announced, between 26th March and 23rd April 2020 thus having knowledge of the scheme. Genuine self-employed people might have submitted an incorrect return to show they are eligible when they are not or to inflate the amount of money received from <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. We analysed this late filer population to understand how this population may have tried to take advantage of the scheme.</p>

<h3>D.4 Not impacted by COVID-19</h3>

<p>The self-employed had to declare that they have been impacted by COVID-19 when claiming the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. The definition of who is impacted was tightened throughout the scheme. The risk is that a self-employed individual has not been impacted by COVID-19 but still claimed the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. Several publicly available sources of information have been used to estimate the size of this risk, including sector-based assessments of the impact of Covid on the self-employed population, and analysis of self-employed incomes during the pandemic.</p>

<h3>D.5 Error</h3>

<p>As the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants 1 to 3 are computed by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> without requiring the customer to input or calculate any figures, the error is solely based on the official error made by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in computing the grant, that might have originated, for example, from a problem in the data. The value of errors identified is then computed with a high-level of precision, knowing the grant received by the taxpayer and the value of the grant which should have been received instead.</p>

<h2>Chapter E: Eat Out to Help Out provisional estimates</h2>

<p>Our main data sources for error and fraud in Eat Out to Help Out are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VAT random enquiry program</li>
  <li>the results of tax compliance activity into restaurant and food businesses</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Intelligence</li>
</ul>

<p>While each component has a different level of evidence, we establish that the overall evidence level to support the provisional estimate of error and fraud in Eat Out to Help Out as mild.</p>

<p>In this chapter we document the components accounted for in the Eat Out to Help Out error and fraud estimate.</p>

<h3>E.1 Organised crime</h3>

<p>To estimate the level of losses, we analyse the volume of payments made where there is a possibility that risk remains following <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pre-payment checks. Note, where a risk remains, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> monitor the claim further and where necessary follow up with post payment checks.</p>

<h3>E.2 Inflated genuine claims</h3>

<p>In lieu of sufficient results from post-payment compliance interventions being available at the point of analysis, as a proxy, the estimate for the ‘inflated genuine claims’ risk is based on sector analysis of the VAT random enquiry program results and comparison to the VAT tax gap.</p>

<h3>E.3 Claiming where ineligible</h3>

<p>There is limited comparable evidence to inform on the risk of ineligible businesses claiming for the scheme. In the absence of additional evidence, values are judged in comparison to other <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> assessments and expert judgement.</p>

<h3>E.4 Error in claimant favour</h3>

<p>The values used for errors working in the claimants’ favour are based on sector analysis of random enquiry results and comparison to the VAT tax gap.</p>

<h3>E.5 Error in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> favour</h3>

<p>The VAT random enquiry program tells us the ratio of error in the claimant versus error in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> favour in VAT.  We apply this same ratio to our estimates of claimant favour error in Eat Out to Help Out to estimate the scale of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> favour error.</p>

<h2>Appendix 1: Latest provisional error and fraud estimates for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>The totals shown here are summed from the risk component (Sections C, D and E) to construct the range.  Given it is unlikely that all the components are at their minimum level or at their maximum at the same time, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to present a simulated 95% confidence interval to eliminate the extreme values at each end of the range.</p>

<p>The Monte Carlo simulation runs 10,000 iterations of the error and fraud range to determine the simulated 95% confidence interval upper and lower bounds of the error and fraud estimates. The range reflects the level of uncertainty and the estimate is rounded to the nearest one decimal place.</p>

<p>For Eat Out to Help Out, <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and components of <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> our evidence is largely assumption-based estimates, based on expert opinion or drawing on operational MI; high-level statistics; nearest analogous compliance process or risk.</p>

<p>Therefore, the provisional estimates should be treated with caution and are presented with clear caveats setting out the limitations of the data.  Where possible we will seek to improve the evidence to improve the confidence in the data. Estimates will change on receipt of further data.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The total error and fraud values are the result of an intermediate Monte Carlo simulation step in the method, to approximate a 95% confidence interval and most likely estimate. The components might not sum up to the total due to rounding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Figures here are largely assumption driven on mild evidence and will be superseded when <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> receives further data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> the balance between opportunistic fraud and error is particularly uncertain. For example, where employers claimed <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> for employees who were working, some cases will have been driven by fraud and others by error. Further compliance data will provide more evidence on the balance between fraud and error as compliance cases are completed.</p>
