<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Throughout this crisis, the government has acted to protect people’s jobs and livelihoods while supporting businesses and public services across the UK. That is why the government introduced unprecedented measures, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> has helped to pay the wages of people in 11.7 million jobs and 2.9 million self-employed workers have received a <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grant. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and HM Treasury designed the schemes to provide support at the right time to those who needed it, whilst also recognising the need to protect taxpayers’ money against error and fraud.</p>

<p>In July last year, at the height of the pandemic, unemployment was expected to peak at 12%. The Office for Budget Responsibility now expect this to peak at 5.2%. That means over two million fewer people out of work than previously feared, following actions taken by the government to support the labour market and the wider economy.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s current estimate for the amount lost to fraud and error in the schemes during 2020 to 2021 is 8.7% in <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, 2.5% in <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> phases 1-3 and 8.5% in the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. This equates to £5.8 billion, against a spend of £81.2 billion. This is in line with the original planning assumptions that informed the design and operational management of the schemes. From the beginning it was clear the schemes would be targets for fraud and that customers would make mistakes. That’s why <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and HM Treasury designed the schemes to prevent as much fraud as possible before any payments were made, while still supporting quickly those who needed it. These design measures gave us the confidence to get the schemes up and running quickly, based on sound judgement about the level of risk involved. The introduction of further changes and improvements during the course of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> (both of which ran for longer than originally envisaged) saw the fraud and error level fall considerably over this reporting period.</p>

<h2>Actions taken to minimise fraud and error in the schemes</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and HM Treasury designed the schemes to protect public money against error, fraud and abuse by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to the maximum extent possible, only making grants for employees and businesses using data held on <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems</li>
  <li>designing the schemes in a way that prevented ineligible claims from being made and blocked suspicious claims from payment up front</li>
  <li>using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s extensive knowledge of customer behaviours and compliance to make an informed assumption of the error and fraud risk</li>
  <li>investing in post-payment compliance to identify and recover amounts overpaid because of fraud and error</li>
</ul>

<p>The government had to make some difficult decisions to balance access to the schemes with the need to minimise fraud. This meant that the schemes could not cover some people, especially where we did not hold the relevant data. This was because of the fundamental need to protect public money against error, fraud and abuse.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We have prevented over 100,000 ineligible or mistaken claims by building automated controls into the digital claim process.</p>
</div>

<p>For <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>, these controls included stopping claims from employers not known to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and capping the number of claims by referencing known employees and the monetary amount claimed to prevent claims exceeding the maximum amount that the employees were entitled to.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> calculated the grant claimants were entitled to based on previous tax returns. This significantly reduced the error and fraud risk, which stands at a most likely estimate of 2.5% for <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> grants 1 to 3.</p>

<h3>Using risk and intelligence profiles developed and consistently updated by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> compliance risk teams to block suspicious claims from being paid</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> blocked over 29,000 claims and registrations in 2020-21 by carrying out further pre-payment checks based on risk and intelligence. This has prevented the loss of more than £206m and effectively countered the threat from organised crime – just 0.3% of the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grants paid were estimated to be lost to organised criminals.</p>

<h3>Investing in a Taxpayer Protection Taskforce</h3>

<p>The government has invested over £100 million in a Taxpayer Protection Taskforce of 1,265 <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> staff to combat fraud in the schemes. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> expect the Taskforce to allow them to increase one-to-one enquiries to 30,000 cases in total, across three years, up to 2022 to 2023. These are expected to recover c.£800 million to £1 billion between 2021 and 2023 in addition to the £536 million in 2020 to 2021. The Taskforce will continue to focus on fraud in the scheme. It will not investigate every instance of potential error or fraud, as in many cases it will not be proportionate or viable to do so.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s 2020 to 2021 compliance results for these schemes amounted to over £743 million, achieved by preventing losses by pre-payment activity and recovering overclaimed grants. Since the start of 2021 to 2022, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has recovered more than £69 million bringing the total stopped or recovered since the start of the COVID schemes to over £812 million with activity ongoing.</p>

<h2>Reduction in fraud and error during the reporting period</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> invested in improvements to the online services, guidance and support to make it easier for customers to get it right. Customers can use the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> disclosure facility where they made an error or no longer need the grant. Using these services, and based on <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s analysis to date, customers have now returned over £650 million in grants that were no longer required and made repayments of more than £350 million to correct mistakes without <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> intervention in addition to the compliance results for the schemes.</p>

<p>As the economy began to re-open the government changed the design of the schemes to recognise that some businesses could start to trade again, and people could begin returning to work in a measured way. The level of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> fraud fell considerably following the introduction of flexible furlough which enabled customers to bring back employees part time without a wider loss of the grant.</p>

<p>HM Treasury and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> introduced more transparency on the use of <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>. From February 2021, employees could check whether they were included in their employer’s <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claim through their online Personal Tax Account, and employer details including employer name, company registration and an indication of the value of amounts claimed have been published. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> have received more than 30,000 reports from the public about the schemes.</p>

<h2>Assessing the level of fraud and error</h2>

<p>Assessing the error and fraud levels in COVID-19 support schemes is a major programme for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s analysts. Evidence gaps make provisional estimates uncertain as they are based on the best available information and will be superseded as we gather more complete data. Our current estimates are broadly in line with initial planning assumptions made during the design phase.</p>

<p>We aim to produce updated error and fraud estimates for <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> and <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> by summer 2022. For the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> we will do this by conducting a random enquiry programme and gaining operational data from completed compliance interventions. We expect to refine the <abbr title="Self-Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> estimates when the full year of 2020 to 2021 Self Assessment data becomes available.</p>

<p>Given that the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was a short-term intervention which is now closed, we do not expect significant new data or information to become available and so are not expecting to update the error and fraud estimates for this scheme.</p>

<h2>Examples of compliance action</h2>

<p>Three real-world cases illustrate how the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> compliance approach works in practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A restaurant claimed to have sold meals worth at least £550,000 on Mondays to Wednesdays in August. This seemed unlikely given the size of the restaurant and an inquiry was opened. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> made contact with the customer, but they provided no evidence to support their claim. The customer eventually said at least 90% of the claims were incorrect but provided no evidence to support the remaining 10%. The restaurant was required to repay the full £274,375 claimed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A suspect <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claim was identified through <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s data analysis work and this was backed up by intelligence received through the Hotline. This suggested staff had been threatened with the sack if they didn’t continue working, even if sick. Following the investigation, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> are working to recover £357,000.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A business claimed to have furloughed all of their workforce through April and May. However, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> analysts found that debit and credit card sales data showed their trade was comparable to pre-lockdown levels. The <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> investigation yielded £53,000.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
