<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>The self-isolation advice for people with coronavirus (COVID-19) has changed. It is now possible to end self-isolation after 7 days, following 2 negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken 24 hours apart. The first <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should not be taken before the sixth day.</p>

<h2>Main messages</h2>

<p>COVID-19 infection rates are very high and the Omicron variant is spreading rapidly. It is important that we all take steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community to save lives and protect the NHS.</p>

<p>If you have COVID-19 <a href="#symptoms" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a> you should stay at home and self-isolate immediately. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> as soon as possible. If this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, you must continue to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you do not have COVID-19 symptoms, but you have a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, you must stay at home and self-isolate.</p>

<p>If you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 you are at significantly higher risk of becoming infected yourself.</p>

<p>If you have been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, you are less likely to become severely ill if you catch COVID-19. You are also less likely to spread COVID-19 to other people, but it is still possible for this to happen. Therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are aged 18 years 6 months or over and you are not fully vaccinated*, and you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, you are legally required to stay at home and self-isolate</li>
  <li>if you are fully vaccinated or aged under 18 years and 6 months, and you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, you are not legally required to self-isolate.  However, you are strongly advised to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test every day for 7 days, and to self-isolate if any of these test results is positive</li>
</ul>

<p>*You are fully vaccinated 14 days after having received 2 doses of an approved vaccine (such as Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca or Moderna/Spikevax) or one dose of the single-dose Janssen vaccine.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are very good at identifying people who have high levels of coronavirus and are most likely to pass on infection to others, even if you do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a one-off payment of Â£500 through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a> if you are legally required to stay at home and self-isolate or you are the parent or guardian of a child who has been told to self-isolate.</p>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people with <a class="govuk-link" href="#symptoms">symptoms</a> that may be caused by COVID-19, including those who are waiting for a test</li>
  <li>people who have received a positive COVID-19 test result (whether or not they have symptoms)</li>
  <li>people who currently live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 symptoms, or with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>In this guidance a household means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one person living alone</li>
  <li>a group of people (who may or may not be related) living at the same address and who share cooking facilities, bathrooms or toilets, or living areas. This may include students in boarding schools or halls of residence who share such facilities</li>
  <li>a group of people who share a nomadic way of life for example those who live on Traveller sites, in vehicles or on canal boats</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance if you have had contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 but do not currently live in the same household as them</a>.</p>

<p>If you have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">arrived in England from overseas you may also need to self-isolate, but should follow separate guidance on travelling to England from another country during COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance applies in England.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>For most people, COVID-19 will be a mild illness. However, if you have any of the symptoms above, even if your symptoms are mild, stay at home and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a test</a>.</p>

<p>There are several other symptoms linked with COVID-19. These other symptoms may have another cause and are not on their own a reason to have a COVID-19 test. If you are concerned about your symptoms, seek medical advice.</p>

<p>If you have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine and have symptoms of COVID-19 or have received a positive test result, you should still follow this guidance. This is because it is still possible to get COVID-19 and spread it to others even if you are vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Tests for COVID-19</h2>

<p>There are 2 main types of test currently being used to detect if someone has COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) antigen tests â also known as rapid lateral flow tests</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests detect the <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> (ribonucleic acid, the genetic material) of a virus. <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests are the most reliable COVID-19 tests. It takes some time to get the results because they are usually processed in a laboratory. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests detect proteins in the coronavirus and work in a similar way to a pregnancy test. They are reliable, simple and quick to use and are very good at identifying people who have high levels of coronavirus and are most likely to pass on infection to others. They are mainly used in people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<h2>If you have COVID-19 symptoms or have received a positive COVID-19 test result</h2>

<h3>Stay at home and self-isolate</h3>

<p>If you develop symptoms of COVID-19, stay at home and self-isolate immediately. If you have a positive test result but do not have <a href="#symptoms" class="govuk-link">symptoms</a>, stay at home and self-isolate as soon as you receive the results. You should do this even if you have received one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Other people in your household might need to isolate too. Please see section below for information <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#samehousehold" class="govuk-link">on what the other members of your household need to do</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">Arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test by ordering it online</a> or by calling 119 if you have not already had one. Stay at home while you are waiting for a home test kit, a test site appointment or a test result. You can leave your home in a few specific circumstances, but do not go to work, school, or public areas and do not use public transport or taxis. See circumstances in which <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1045/made">you can leave home</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to leave your home to get to a test site, wear a face covering, stay at least 2 metres apart from other people who you do not live with, and return home immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>If you are notified by NHS Test and Trace of a positive test result you must complete a period of self-isolation. Your isolation period starts immediately from when your symptoms started, or, if you do not have any symptoms, from when your positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test was taken, whichever test was taken first. Your isolation period includes the day your symptoms started (or the day your test was taken if you do not have symptoms), and the next 10 full days.</p>

<p>This means that if, for example, your symptoms started at any time on the 15th of the month (or if you did not have symptoms but your first positive COVID-19 test was taken on the 15th), your isolation period ends at 23:59hrs on the 25th of the month.</p>

<p>You can return to your normal routine and stop self-isolating after 10 full days if your symptoms have gone, or if the only symptoms you have are a cough or anosmia, which can last for several weeks. If you still have a high temperature after 10 days or are otherwise unwell, stay at home and seek medical advice.</p>

<p>You may be able to end your self-isolation period before the end of the 10 full days. You can take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test from 6 days after the day your symptoms started (or the day your test was taken if you did not have symptoms), and another <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on the following day. The second <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test should be taken at least 24 hours later. If both these test results are negative, and you do not have a high temperature, you may end your self-isolation after the second negative test result.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">Report your <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results</a> after taking each test</p>

<p>You should not take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before the sixth day of your isolation period, and you should only end your self-isolation after you have had 2 consecutive negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which should be taken at least 24 hours apart. You should stop testing after you have had 2 consecutive negative test results.</p>

<p>This guidance also applies to children and young people who usually attend an education or childcare setting.</p>

<h4>Examples of when to end self-isolation if you have had COVID-19 symptoms or have received a positive COVID-19 test result</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/139357/Isolation_graphic_960_x_640_.png" alt="Infographic showing testing example for ending self-isolation early."></div></figure>

<p>This means that if, for example, your symptoms started at any time on the 15th of the month (or if you did not have symptoms but your first positive COVID-19 test was taken on the 15th), you may take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests from the 21st of the month. If your <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results are negative on the 21st and 22nd, and you do not have a high temperature, you may end your isolation period after the negative test result on the 22nd of the month.</p>

<p>If both your <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results are negative, it is likely that you were not infectious at the time the tests were taken. To further reduce the chance of passing COVID-19 on to others, if you end your self-isolation period before 10 full days you are strongly advised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces</li>
  <li>to work from home if you are able to</li>
  <li>in addition to venues where it is a legal requirement, to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces and where you are in close contact with other people</li>
  <li>to limit contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19</li>
  <li>to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should follow this advice until 10 full days from when your self-isolation period started.</p>

<p>You should not take any more <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests after the 10th day of your isolation period and you may stop self-isolating after this day. This is because you are unlikely to be infectious after the 10th day of your isolation period. Even if you have a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result on the 10th day of your self-isolation period you should not take any more <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests after this day.  If you are concerned you may choose to keep following the above advice until 14 days after the start of your self-isolation period.</p>

<p>There is additional <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance for those working in health and social care settings</a>.</p>

<p>If you are isolating because of a positive test result but did not have any symptoms, and you develop COVID-19 symptoms within your isolation period, start a new isolation period from the day your symptoms start.</p>

<p>If you develop COVID-19 symptoms at any point after ending your first period of isolation you and your household should follow the steps in this guidance again.</p>

<p>Most people with COVID-19 will experience a mild illness. Seek prompt medical attention if your illness or the illness of someone in your household is worsening.</p>

<p>Stay as far away from other members of your household as possible. Wherever possible, avoid using shared spaces such as kitchens and other living areas while others are present and take your meals back to your room to eat. Wear a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> or a surgical mask when spending time in shared areas inside your home.</p>

<p>Take exercise within your home, garden or private outdoor space. Follow the general advice to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#Reducing">reduce the spread of the infection</a> within your household.</p>

<p>It may be difficult for some people to separate themselves from others in their household. Not all these measures will be possible if you are living with children or have caring responsibilities but follow this guidance to the best of your ability in these circumstances.</p>

<p>If you receive a request by text, email or phone to log into the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace</a> service website you should do this. You will be asked about when your symptoms started. You should provide this information because it will be used to identify who has been in contact with you while you have been infectious.</p>

<p>You will be asked about your recent contacts so that they can be given public health advice. They will not be told your identity. It is very important that you provide this information, as it will play a vital role in helping to protect your family, friends and the wider community.</p>

<h3>Visitors to your household</h3>

<p>Do not invite or allow social visitors to enter your home, including friends and family. If you want to speak to someone who is not a member of your household, use the phone, email or social media.</p>

<p>If you or a family member receive essential care in your home, carers should continue to visit and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-home-care/coronavirus-covid-19-provision-of-home-care">provision of home care guidance</a> to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

<p>All non-essential in-house services and repairs should be postponed until the self-isolation period is completed. Delivery drivers should not come into your home, so make sure you ask them to leave items outside for collection.</p>

<h3>If you have a negative COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result after being tested because you had symptoms</h3>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative but you still have symptoms, you may have another viral illness such as a cold, flu or a stomach bug. You should stay at home until you feel well and for at least 2 more days if you have had <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diarrhoea-and-vomiting/">diarrhoea or vomiting</a>. Seek medical attention if you are concerned about your symptoms.</p>

<p>You can stop isolating unless you have been advised by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus/" rel="external">NHS Test and Trace that you are legally required to self-isolate</a>. Anyone in your household who is isolating because of your symptoms can also stop isolating.</p>

<h3>Testing after your isolation period has ended</h3>

<p>If you have tested positive by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for COVID-19, you will probably have developed some immunity to the disease. However, it cannot be guaranteed that everyone will develop immunity, or how long it will last. It is possible for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests to remain positive for some time after the period of active COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>If you have previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, you are usually advised not to take another <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days of this result. You should only have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days of a previous positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if you develop any new symptoms of COVID-19, if you have a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result, or if you are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK.</p>

<p>If you have a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result within 90 days of a previous positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result you must stay at home, self-isolate and follow the steps in this guidance again.</p>

<p>If it is more than 90 days since you tested positive by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for COVID-19, and you have new symptoms of COVID-19, or a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, follow the steps in this guidance again.</p>

<h2>If you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19</h2>

<p>Follow separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance if you have had contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 but do not currently live in the same household as them</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 should stay at home, self-isolate immediately and order a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>If you do not have symptoms of COVID-19 and live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, you are legally required to self-isolate unless you meet any of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are fully vaccinated. Fully vaccinated means you have had 2 doses of an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countries-with-approved-covid-19-vaccination-programmes-and-proof-of-vaccination">approved vaccine</a> such as Pfizer BioNTech, AstraZeneca or Spikevax (formerly Moderna). You are also fully vaccinated if you have had one dose of the single-dose Janssen vaccine</li>
  <li>you are below 18 years 6 months</li>
  <li>you have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial</li>
  <li>you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>If you meet any of these four conditions (and are therefore not legally required to self-isolate), follow the guidance further down for <a class="govuk-link" href="#NotRequired">contacts who are not legally required to self-isolate</a>.</p>

<h2>Household contacts who are required to self-isolate</h2>

<p>If you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, and you are aged over 18 years and 6 months and not fully vaccinated, you are legally required to self-isolate. This does not apply if you have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial or you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons. Do not go to work, school, or public areas and do not use public transport or taxis.</p>

<p>Your isolation period includes the day the first person in your householdâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms">symptoms</a> started (or the day their test was taken if they did not have symptoms) and the next 10 full days. This means that if, for example, your 10 day isolation period starts on the 15th of the month, your isolation period ends at 23:59 hrs on the 25th and you can return to your normal routine.</p>

<p>You may be entitled to a payment of Â£500 from your local authority under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme">Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a>. If you are the parent or guardian of a child who has been told to self-isolate, you may also be entitled to this payment.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with self-isolation may result in a fine, starting from Â£1,000. Parents or guardians are legally responsible for ensuring that anyone under 18 self-isolates if they test positive for COVID-19 and are contacted by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate.</p>

<h3>Take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h3>

<p>You are advised to take a single <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible while you are self-isolating. You should take this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test because you are at a higher risk of being infected. The results of the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test will help NHS Test and Trace contact people who may have caught the virus from you. They can then self-isolate and avoid passing it on to others.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result during your isolation period is negative, you must continue to self-isolate as you could still become infectious and pass the infection on to others. Stay at home for the full 10 days to avoid putting others at risk.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, <a class="govuk-link" href="#SymptomsPositiveTest">follow the advice for people with COVID-19</a> to stay at home. You must start a new self-isolation period, regardless of where you are in your original 10 day isolation period. This means that your total isolation period may be longer than 10 days.</p>

<p>If you have previously tested positive by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for COVID-19, you will probably have developed some immunity to the disease. However, it cannot be guaranteed that everyone will develop immunity, or how long it will last. It is possible for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests to remain positive for some time after COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>If you have previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result within the last 90 days and you are identified as a contact of someone with COVID-19 you should not take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. You should only take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19, if you have a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result, or if you are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK.</p>

<h3>If you develop symptoms while you are self-isolating as a contact</h3>

<p>If you develop <a class="govuk-link" href="#symptoms">symptoms</a> while you are isolating, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>. If your test result is positive, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="#SymptomsPositiveTest">advice for people with COVID-19</a> to stay at home. You must start a new self-isolation period. This begins when your symptoms started, regardless of where you are in your original 10 day isolation period. This means that your total isolation period may be longer than 10 days.</p>

<p>If this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative, you must continue to self-isolate as you could still become infectious and pass the infection on to others. Stay at home for the full 10 days to avoid putting others at risk.</p>

<p>If other household members develop symptoms during this period, you do not need to isolate for longer than 10 days.</p>

<h2>Household contacts who are not required to self-isolate</h2>

<p>If you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 you are at significantly higher risk of becoming infected yourself.</p>

<p>If you are fully vaccinated or aged under 18 years and 6 months, and you live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, you are not legally required to self-isolate. You are also not legally required to self-isolate if you have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial or you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons.</p>

<p>COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of you becoming severely ill if you catch COVID-19. If you are vaccinated against COVID-19 you may still catch it and pass it on to others, even if you do not have any symptoms.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are very good at identifying people who have high levels of coronavirus and are most likely to pass on infection to others, even if you do not have symptoms. You are therefore strongly advised to take daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests during the period you are at highest risk of becoming infected yourself.</p>

<p>If you are aged 5 years and over and live in the same household as someone with COVID-19, and are not legally required to self-isolate, you are strongly advised to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test every day for 7 days, or until 10 days after the household member who has COVID-19 started their self-isolation period if this is earlier</li>
  <li>take this daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before you leave your home for the first time that day</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">Report your <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results</a> after taking each test.</p>

<p>If you take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the result is positive, you should immediately self-isolate to prevent you from passing the infection on to other people. You should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>. If this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, you must self-isolate and <a href="#SymptomsPositiveTest" class="govuk-link">follow the advice for people who have COVID-19</a>. If this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative, you can stop self-isolating but you should continue to take your daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<p>If your daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is negative, it is likely that you were not infectious at the time the test was taken. To further reduce the chance of passing COVID-19 on to others, you are strongly advised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces</li>
  <li>to work from home if you are able to</li>
  <li>in addition to venues where it is a legal requirement, to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces and where you are in close contact with other people</li>
  <li>to limit contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19</li>
  <li>to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe">guidance on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unable to take a daily <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test then you are still strongly advised to follow this advice to reduce the chance of passing COVID-19 on to others.</p>

<p>Follow this advice until the household member who has COVID-19 reaches the end of their self-isolation period.</p>

<p>If you are a health or social care worker who has been identified as a household contact and are exempt from self-isolation, there is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">additional guidance available</a> that you should follow to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19 in these settings.</p>

<p>Children and young people aged under 18 years 6 months who usually attend an education or childcare setting and who have been identified as a close contact should continue to attend the setting as normal.</p>

<p>Regular <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are not recommended for children aged under 5. If they live with someone who has COVID-19 they are not legally required to self-isolate but you should limit their contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19 and arrange for them to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you develop <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms">symptoms</a> at any time, even if these are mild, stay at home and self-isolate immediately, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#SymptomsPositiveTest" class="govuk-link">guidance for people with COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>Reducing the spread of COVID-19 in your household</h2>

<h3>How COVID-19 is spread</h3>

<p>COVID-19 spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19 when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them. The risk of spread is greatest when people are close to each other, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and when people spend a lot of time together in the same room.</p>

<p>Keeping your distance, washing your hands and good respiratory hygiene (using and disposing of tissues), cleaning surfaces and keeping indoor spaces <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus">well ventilated</a> are the most important ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>People who have COVID-19 can infect others from around 2 days before symptoms start, and for up to 10 days after. They can pass the infection to others, even if they have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which is why they must stay at home.</p>

<p>People who live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing COVID-19. They could spread the disease to others even when feeling well.</p>

<h3>How to limit close contact with others in the household if you have COVID-19</h3>

<p>Spend as little time as possible in shared spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. Avoid using shared spaces such as kitchens and other living areas while others are present and take your meals back to your room to eat. Observe strict social distancing.</p>

<p>Ask the people you live with to help by bringing your meals to your door, helping with cleaning and by giving you space.</p>

<p>Use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household where possible. If a separate bathroom is not available, try and use the facilities last, before cleaning the bathroom using your usual cleaning products. The bathroom should be cleaned regularly.</p>

<p>You should use separate towels from other household members, both for drying yourself after bathing or showering and for drying your hands. Keep your room well-ventilated by opening a window to the outside.</p>

<p>Use a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">face covering</a> or a surgical mask when spending time in shared areas inside your home to minimise the risk of spread to others. Used correctly, they may help to protect others by reducing the transmission of COVID-19 but they do not replace the need to limit your contact with other household members.</p>

<p>Following expert clinical advice and the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, people previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable are no longer being advised to shield. Some people are still at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19 and may have been advised by their health professional to consider taking additional precautions. If someone in the household has been advised to take such precautions, such as maintaining distance from others, they should be supported to do so.</p>

<h3>Things you can do to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in your household</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.germdefence.org/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">GermDefence</a> is a website that can help you identify ways to protect yourself and others in your household from COVID-19. It provides scientifically proven advice on reducing the risks from COVID-19 and other viruses in your home.</p>

<p>GermDefence is easy to use and only takes 10 minutes to identify actions and make a plan on how to protect yourself. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://lang.germdefence.org/">GermDefence</a> is also available in a range of different languages.</p>

<p>Everyone should also take the following steps to reduce the spread of infection within their household. Please also refer to the accompanying illustrated guide to reducing household transmission.</p>

<h4>Wash your hands</h4>

<p>This is an important way to reduce the risk of catching COVID-19 or passing it on to others. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose and before you eat or handle food. Clean your hands frequently and avoid touching your face.</p>

<h4>Cover coughs and sneezes</h4>

<p>Cover your mouth and nose with disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand.</p>

<p>Dispose of tissues into a rubbish bag and immediately wash your hands. If you have a carer, they should use disposable tissues to wipe away any mucus or phlegm after you have sneezed or coughed and then wash or sanitise their hands.</p>

<h4>Clean your home to reduce spread of infection</h4>
<p>Regularly clean frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles and remote controls, and shared areas such as kitchens and bathrooms.</p>

<p>Use standard household cleaning products like detergents and bleach to clean your home as these are very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces. Clean shared bathrooms each time they are used, especially the surfaces you have touched, using your usual bathroom cleaning products.</p>

<p>Cleaning cloths and personal waste such as used tissues and disposable face coverings should be stored in disposable rubbish bags. These bags should be placed into another bag, tied securely and put aside for at least 72 hours before being put in your usual external household waste bin. Other household waste can be disposed of as normal.</p>

<p>Use a dishwasher to clean and dry your crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them by hand using washing up liquid and warm water and dry thoroughly using a separate tea towel.</p>

<h4>Laundry</h4>

<p>To reduce the possibility of spreading the virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry. Wash items in accordance with the manufacturerâs instructions. All dirty laundry can be washed in the same load. If you do not have a washing machine, wait a further 72 hours after your self-isolation has ended when you can then take the laundry to a public launderette.</p>

<p>Do not share towels, including hand towels and tea towels.</p>

<h4>Ventilate indoor areas</h4>

<p>If someone is self-isolating, keep a window slightly open in their room and keep the door closed to reduce the spread of contaminated air to other parts of the household. If the person that is self-isolating needs to use any shared space in the home, such as the kitchen or other living areas while others are present, keep these spaces well ventilated, for example by opening windows while the person who is self-isolating is in the shared space, and for a short period after they have left.</p>

<p>Leave extractor fans (for example in bathrooms) running for longer than usual with the door closed after use.</p>

<h4>Caring for pets</h4>

<p>COVID-19 in the UK is spread between humans. There is limited evidence that some animals, including pets, can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) following close contact with infected humans.</p>

<p>Pet owners who have COVID-19 or who are self-isolating with symptoms should restrict contact with pets and wash their hands thoroughly before and after interacting with their pet.</p>

<h2>Looking after your health and wellbeing</h2>

<h3>Looking after your mental and physical wellbeing while staying at home</h3>

<p>Staying at home and self-isolating for a prolonged period can be difficult, frustrating and lonely for some people and you or other household members may feel low. It can be particularly challenging if you do not have much space or access to a garden.</p>

<p>Remember to take care of your mind as well as your body and get support if you need it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Every Mind Matters</a> provides simple tips and advice to take better care of your mental health, including a COVID-19 hub with advice for those staying at home.</p>

<p>Many people find it helpful to remind themselves why what they are doing is so important. By staying at home, you are helping to protect your friends and family, other people in your community and the NHS.</p>

<p>Things that you can do to help make staying at home easier:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep in touch with friends and family over the phone or through social media</li>
  <li>remember that physical exercise can be good for your wellbeing. Look for online classes or courses that can help you take light exercise in your home</li>
  <li>plan ahead and think about what you will need to be able to stay at home for the full duration</li>
  <li>ask your employer, friends and family for help to access the things you will need while staying at home</li>
  <li>think about and plan how you can get food and other supplies, such as medication, that you will need during this period</li>
  <li>check if your neighbourhood or local community has a volunteer system that could help bring you supplies or provide other support</li>
  <li>ask friends or family to drop off anything you need or order supplies online or by phone, making sure these are left outside your home for you to collect</li>
  <li>think about things you can do during your time at home such as cooking, reading, online learning and watching films</li>
  <li>many people find it helpful to plan out the full 10 days. You may also find it helpful to plan in advance what you will do if, for example, someone in your household were to feel much worse</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need help for a mental health crisis, emergency or breakdown, seek immediate advice and assessment. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent mental health support is available to adults and children around the clock. Find your <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/mental-health-services/where-to-get-urgent-help-for-mental-health/">local NHS helpline</a> by searching for your postcode or home town in a new service finder.</p>

<h3>If you need medical advice</h3>

<p>Health and care services remain open to help people with all health conditions, including COVID-19. Most people with COVID-19 will experience a mild illness which can be managed at home. Find out more about <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/how-to-treat-symptoms-at-home/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">managing the symptoms of COVID-19 at home</a>.</p>

<p>All routine medical and dental appointments should be cancelled while you are staying at home. If you are concerned or have been asked to attend in person during this time, discuss this with your medical contact first (for example, your GP or dentist, local hospital or outpatient service).</p>

<p>Seek prompt medical attention if your illness or the illness of someone in your household is worsening. If it is not an emergency, contact the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online</a> COVID-19 service or NHS 111 for other health conditions. If you have no internet access, call NHS 111.</p>

<p>If it is a medical emergency and you need to call an ambulance, dial 999. Inform the call handler or operator that you or someone in your household has COVID-19 or symptoms if that is the case.</p>

<h2>Financial or other practical support</h2>

<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p>Self-isolation is one of the most important things we can do to help stop the spread of the virus and protect our friends and family, our community and the NHS. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, have received a positive test result, or have been told you are a contact with someone who has, self-isolation is the only way to guarantee you wonât pass COVID-19 to others. If you are told to isolate, you should do so straight away. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support" class="govuk-link">Find out what support you can get if youâre affected by COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If you can, ask friends, family or neighbours to go out and get food and other essentials for you. If you do not have others to help you, there may be charities or community groups who can help in your area or your local shops, markets and wholesalers may offer a delivery service (by phone or by email).</p>

<p>The NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to help support those who need it. Volunteers can collect and deliver shopping, medication and other essential supplies and can also provide a regular friendly phone call. Call 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm, 7 days a week to self-refer or visit <a href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Volunteer Responders</a> for further information. There may also be other voluntary or community services in your local area that you can access for support.</p>

<h3>Additional support for those who lead a nomadic way of life</h3>

<p>People who live on a traveller site, in a vehicle or on a canal boat may require additional support.</p>

<p>Let your site manager or local Gypsy and Traveller liaison team know if you need further support. If you are living on a river or canal, find out what advice is being offered by the organisation who manages the waterway you live on, as this varies for each one. Try to communicate by phone as much as possible to prevent spreading the virus to further contacts.</p>

<p>If you lack access to basic facilities such as water, sanitation and waste disposal to help with self-isolation, contact your local authority for assistance. They may be able to provide you with additional facilities or make alternative stopping places available.</p>

<p>The prevailing laws against <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-illegal-and-unauthorised-encampments">unauthorised encampments</a> or unauthorised development remain in place.</p>

<p>Waste should continue to be disposed of through authorised and legal means. Guidance for local authorities on re-opening or keeping household waste and recycling centres open is available. If you need further advice, contact your local authority.</p>

<p>If you are stopping or cruising in rural or isolated areas, take note of your location if you moor or pull up, especially if you are feeling unwell. You can also use the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://what3words.com/gelbes.beinen.freudige">what3words app</a> if there is a medical emergency and you need services to come to you.</p>

<h3>If you are breastfeeding</h3>

<p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, have tested positive or are living in a household with someone who has COVID-19, you may be concerned about the infection spreading to your baby if you are breastfeeding.</p>

<p>The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breast milk or by being in close contact, however, this will be an individual decision. Talk to your midwife, health visitor or GP by telephone.</p>

<p>There is currently no evidence to suggest that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through breast milk. However, COVID-19 infection can be passed on to a baby in the same way as it can to anyone in close contact with you. The current evidence is that children with COVID-19 get much less severe symptoms than adults. If you or a family member are feeding with formula or expressed milk, sterilise the equipment carefully before each use. You should not share bottles or a breast pump with someone else.</p>

<h3>People with learning disabilities, autism or serious mental illnesses</h3>

<p>Not all these measures will be possible if you, or those you live with, have conditions such as learning disabilities, autism or serious mental illnesses. Follow this guidance to the best of your ability, while keeping yourself and those close to you safe and well, ideally in line with any existing care plans.</p>
