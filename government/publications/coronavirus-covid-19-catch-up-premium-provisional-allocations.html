<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) catch-up premium: allocations for academic year 2020 to 2021 and conditions of grant</h2>

<p>The universal catch-up premium funding is available for all state-funded mainstream and special schools, and alternative provision. It covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary, middle, secondary and all-through local authority maintained schools, academies and free schools</li>
  <li>local authority maintained special schools</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>alternative provision (AP) academies and free schools</li>
  <li>local authority-maintained and academy hospital schools</li>
  <li>local authorities for special educational needs and disability (SEND) pupils they place in independent special settings</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-catch-up-premium">More information</a> is available.</p>

<p>This page shows allocations for the academic year 2020 to 2021, details of the first and second payment of the 3 tranches and conditions of grant for local authorities.</p>

<h3>Final allocations</h3>

<p>Final allocations for the second and third payments in 2021, are calculated as follows:</p>

<p>for primary, middle, secondary and all-through local authority-maintained schools, academies and free schools</p>

<ul>
  <li>£80 for each pupil aged 4 and over recorded in reception to year group 11 in the October 2020 school census</li>
  <li>£240 for each pupil in SEN units in mainstream schools as recorded on the 2020 to 2021 authority proforma tool (APT)</li>
</ul>

<p>for local authority maintained special schools and pupil referral units, the higher of</p>

<ul>
  <li>£240 for each high needs place recorded on their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/section-251-2019-to-2020" class="govuk-link">local authority’s section 251 budget return statement for 2019 to 2020</a>; or</li>
  <li>£240 for each pupil aged 4 and over recorded on the October 2020 census</li>
</ul>

<p>for special, AP and free schools, and for non-maintained special schools, the higher of</p>

<ul>
  <li>£240 per place from published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-allocated-place-numbers" class="govuk-link">high needs place numbers for the 2020 to 2021 academic year</a>; or</li>
  <li>£240 for each pupil aged 4 and over recorded on the October 2020 census</li>
</ul>

<p>for maintained and academy hospital schools, the second payment will be based on the provisional allocations. We will modify the allocations prior to the third payment to take account of changes to places as a result of the annual place review</p>

<p>for local authorities with SEND pupils placed in independent special settings the second payment will be based on the provisional allocation. We will update the allocation prior to the third payment based on</p>

<ul>
  <li>£240 for each pupil with an education health and care plan, or SEN support, educated in an independent special setting, as recorded on their January 2021 alternative provision census</li>
