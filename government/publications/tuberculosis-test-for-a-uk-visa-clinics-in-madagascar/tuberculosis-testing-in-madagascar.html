<p>You must be tested for tuberculosis (TB) if you are coming to the UK for more than 6 months and are a resident of Madagascar.</p>

<p>Your test must be from a clinic approved by the Home Office and you will need to obtain an IOM medical certificate confirming that you are free from TB. We will not accept a TB test certificate from a clinic we have not approved.</p>

<p>You do not need a certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a diplomatic passport holder travelling on official business or on a posting to the UK</li>
  <li>qualify for an exempt visa</li>
  <li>are applying for a certificate of entitlement</li>
</ul>

<h4>Clinic address</h4>

</ul>

<p>Operating hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday to Thursday: 8am to 5pm</li>
  <li>Fridays: 8am to 2pm</li>
</ul>

<p>Closed on national and IOM holidays.</p>

<h2>Attending the clinic</h2>

<p>To arrange your medical examination, please call the clinic at least 10 week before your travel to allow processing in case you may require further testing after the initial examination. You should make it clear you need the test for a UK visa application.</p>

<p>You should make it clear that you need the test for a UK visa application. You can expect to get an appointment within a few days of your request. At busy times you may have to wait 10 days for an appointment, especially during the UK student visa peak season between June to September. We cannot arrange or prioritise appointments for you.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a chest x-ray<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-tb-screening-for-the-uk-leaflet"> to test for TB</a>. If the result of the x-ray is not clear, you may also be asked to give a sputum sample (phlegm coughed up from your lungs).</p>

<p>If your test shows that you do not have TB, you’ll be given a certificate which is valid for 6 months from the date of your x-ray. Include this certificate with your UK visa application.</p>

<h2>What you should bring with you</h2>

<p>You will need to bring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>valid identification which contains your photograph, such as a passport, national ID card or Refugee Asylum Seeker Card</li>
  <li>UNHCR/MHA registration documents if you are a refugee applicant</li>
  <li>the TB test fee</li>
  <li>if you have had TB in the past or have any other lung disease, you should provide details of your previous screening and, if possible, your medical notes and x-ray results</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test fees</h2>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>140 US dollars</td>
      <td>70 US dollars</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The fee must be paid in US dollars. The cost of the test is in addition to the visa application fee.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>

<p>Payment must be made before registration through bank deposit or in cash at the clinic. Your appointment will be scheduled only after the clinic has confirmed receipt of your payment.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

IOM bank account 00009 05055 12625440007 05. 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>The test fee does not cover treatment if you have TB.</p>

<h2>Step-by-step procedures</h2>

<ul>
  <li>medical examination will be processed after IOM will register the applicant and hand over a referral letter for the applicant to present himself/herself to the Cabinet Médical MANOHISOA for examination</li>
  <li>all visa applicants must attend the clinic for the assessment with all the required documents</li>
  <li>the initial examination will include a counselling session and signing a consent form</li>
  <li>applicants aged 10 and under will go through a medical examination by the physician before a certificate is issued</li>
  <li>applicants aged 11 and above will have a chest x-ray done; applicants will then be reviewed by the doctor with the chest x-ray result before a certificate is issued</li>
  <li>additional sputum smears and cultures medical procedures may apply in case of abnormal chest x-ray findings and could take up to 8 weeks to get the final results</li>
  <li>a TB clearance certificate will be issued to the applicant on the day of the examination if the examination result is considered free of active pulmonary TB disease</li>
  <li>if you do not return within 7 days for sputum collection, you will not get a TB clearance certificate</li>
  <li>you will be given further testing or told to contact your own health care provider if the examination results are abnormal but the abnormality is not related to TB disease</li>
  <li>the TB clearance certificate expires 6 months from the chest x-ray date if you had a chest x-ray done, or 6 months from the physical examination date if you don’t need a chest x-ray</li>
  <li>the TB clearance certificate is valid for 3 months if you have been in contact with a family member with active pulmonary TB</li>
  <li>female applicants may be requested to undergo a pregnancy test, in case there is uncertainty as to whether they may be pregnant</li>
  <li>pregnant applicants can decide not to get a chest x-ray examination and instead either give sputum for a TB test on 3 consecutive mornings or delay the TB screening until after giving birth</li>
