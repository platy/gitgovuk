<p>In this report we use ‘screening year 2020 to 2021’ to refer to 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. See more information about the terminology used in this report in section 5.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is the third data report on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cervical-screening-programme-standards/cervical-screening-programme-standards-valid-for-data-collected-from-1-april-2018">national cervical screening programme standards</a> and the first report published since the transfer of screening functions from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) to NHS England and NHS Improvement on 1 October 2021.</p>

<p>This report focuses on performance in England from April 2020 to March 2021 but also includes trend data from previous years where this is available.</p>

<p>These standards contribute to assessing the quality of the cervical screening programme (<abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>) across England. Publishing the data ensures stakeholders and the public have access to reliable and timely information on the quality and performance of the screening programme.</p>

<p>The standards focus on some of the important targets providers have to meet and maintain to make sure local screening services are high quality, safe and effective.</p>

<p>This report provides data on coverage, timeliness of receiving results, laboratory and colposcopy clinical standards.</p>

<p>Where the data show that standards are not met or there are data collection issues, providers and commissioners should ensure appropriate action is taken to address the issue. NHS England and NHS Improvement’s section 7a commissioning and operations team works with the screening quality assurance service (<abbr title="Screening Quality Assurance Service">SQAS</abbr>) to provide advice and support to this process.</p>

<p>The data in this report complements that published jointly by NHS Digital and NHS England and NHS Improvement in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/cervical-screening-annual/england---2020-21" rel="external">annual cervical screening statistical bulletin for 2020 to 2021</a>. The coverage data differs slightly to the statistical bulletin because it is based on clinical commissioning group rather than local authority.</p>

<p>The report covers the first full year of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> primary screening since the implementation of the new screening pathway in December 2019. This involved a large decrease from 48 laboratory cytology services in the screening year ending in March 2020 to the 8 laboratories operating throughout the screening year 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which began in early 2020, is likely to have had some impact on the data. All individuals who were due to be invited throughout the screening year 2020 to 2021 were invited by the <abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>, but attendance for screening was affected by the pandemic. As a result, the data in this report should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p>For those standards based on quarterly colposcopy data submissions, the data presented in this report has gone back to the usual method of using an annual submission. For the previous report (2019 to 2020 screening year) the data were calculated by adding together all 4 quarters of the submissions. The change in approach for that year was made to reduce the burden on providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<span class="number">1. </span> Coverage</h2>

<p>This section covers standards <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cervical-screening-programme-standards/cervical-screening-programme-standards-valid-for-data-collected-from-1-april-2018#csp-s01-coverage-under-50-years"><abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>-S01</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cervical-screening-programme-standards/cervical-screening-programme-standards-valid-for-data-collected-from-1-april-2018#csp-s02-coverage-50-years-and-above"><abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>-S02</a>.</p>

<p>We measure coverage of the screening programmes to provide assurance that screening is offered to the eligible population.</p>

<p>Eligible individuals are those entitled to an offer of screening. For cervical screening, this is individuals aged 24 years and 6 months up to 64 years, who have a cervix.</p>

<p>Coverage is an important indicator for the programme to achieve its aims of reducing incidence and mortality.</p>

<p>Figure 7: Cervical screening – receiving results within 14 days, England, screening year 2020 to 2021</p>

<p>This standard is affected by transport of samples, reporting times in laboratories and result letter administration by the call and recall service.</p>

<p><abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> primary screening was implemented across England in December 2019. This affected the whole screening pathway throughout the screening year 2019 to 2020 and the previous 3 years while planning for the change took place. It meant the standard of at least 98% of women receiving their results within 14 days of their test being taken was not met. Since the implementation of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> primary screening, performance against this standard has significantly improved, although still does not yet meet the minimum level required.</p>

This standard is important to monitor to help reduce the chance of abnormalities not being detected. The change to <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> primary screening has resulted in a small increase in sensitivity. This is likely to be because only screening samples that are known to be <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> positive receive a cytology review.</p>

<p>Figure 12: Cervical screening – proportion of samples reported as cytology inadequate, England, screening year 2020 to 2021</p>

<p>The inadequate rate is reported for women aged 25 to 64 who were screened at a GP practice or community clinic.</p>

<p>Rates should be low as tests reported as inadequate mean they need to be repeated to get a result for the woman. However, some inadequate results are expected due to technical or administrative reasons.</p>

<p>Prior to the screening year ending in March 2021, this standard was measured by calculating a 5% to 95% ‘acceptable’ range annually from the rates for all laboratories. As there are now only 8 laboratories, this is no longer an appropriate method to calculate a standard range. Whilst the method for calculating a standard is being reviewed, the range will be reported. The Section 7a commissioning and operations team with Screening Quality Assurance Service (<abbr title="Screening Quality Assurance Service">SQAS</abbr>) and commissioners will continue to monitor trends in the rate of inadequate cytology tests but will not apply a standard.</p>

<p>The minimum rate reported was 0.12%.</p>

<p>The maximum rate reported was 0.98%.</p>

<p>Figure 13: <abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>-S05: Proportion of samples reported as cytology inadequate, England, screening year ending March 2015 to the year ending March 2021</p>

<p>The line graph above shows an increase from 2.5% to 2.7% over the screening years ending March 2015 to 2017. It then shows a decrease to 2.3% in the screening year ending March 2019 before a large decrease to 0.4% in the screening year ending March 2021. The large decrease in this period is likely due to the benefits of the roll out of <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> primary testing. <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> testing is more likely to obtain an adequate result than cytology and as all cytology samples tested are known to be <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> positive, there is less chance of an inadequate cytology result.</p>

<p>Colposcopy clinics provide data using the mandatory KC65 return apart from <abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>-S09 which uses a special data request. For those standards based on KC65 data, the data presented in this report has gone back to the usual method of using an annual submission. For the prior 2019 to 2020 screening year the data were calculated by adding together all 4 quarters of the submissions. The change in approach for that year was made to reduce the burden on providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In the screening year ending March 2021, 192 colposcopy clinics returned data for the majority of the standards (compared to 193 the year before). The reduction is due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operation of some clinic sites which remained closed and on the staff resources to complete the data collection process.</p>

<p>This standard is important to ensure that women receive the results of their biopsy (diagnostic or treatment) in a timely manner. This ensures that those who require further treatment and those who do not are informed in writing at the earliest opportunity. Achievement of this standard is influenced by the timeliness of histology reporting and the efficiency of colposcopy clinic administration.</p>

<p>For results received within 4 weeks, the minimum rate reported was 12.3%.</p>

<p>For results received within 8 weeks, the minimum rate reported was 52.1%.</p>

<p>The data show that 114 of 192 clinics reported at least 90% of results were received within 4 weeks, and 108 of 192 reported all results were received within 8 weeks.</p>

<p>It is important to maximise successful treatment to ensure that the number of women with residual high grade disease or cancer within 12 months of treatment is as low as possible.</p>

<p>Not all clinics could supply data for this standard – 161 of 176 clinics returned figures. This is an improvement from the screening year ending March 2020 where 155 clinics returned data. Services and commissioners are responsible for taking action to ensure accurate and complete data are reported from all clinics.</p>

<p>The minimum rate reported was 0%.</p>

<p>The maximum rate reported was 20%.</p>

<p>Standard <abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>-10 is important to ensure that women have prompt referral for colposcopy assessment to reduce anxiety, and to make sure that no abnormality is missed and a definitive screening result is achieved.</p>

<p>This standard covers women referred to colposcopy following persistent inadequate cytology or unavailable <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> result, with the most recent result being inadequate cytology.</p>

<p>Not all clinics reported receiving inadequate referrals – 165 of 192 clinics had referrals in this category. The remaining 27 reported no inadequate referrals during the time period.</p>

<p>The minimum rate reported was 0%.</p>

<p>The data show that 61 of 165 clinics reported that all inadequate referrals were offered an appointment within 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Standard <abbr title="Cervical Screening Programme">CSP</abbr>-S11 is important to ensure that women are seen within 6 weeks of their abnormal screening result for further assessment. This ensures timely management and reduces anxiety.</p>

<p>In the screening year 2020 to 2021, referrals due to positive high-risk <abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> (<abbr title="high-risk human papillomavirus">HR-HPV</abbr>) with a negative cytology result are recorded in the ‘other’ referral indication category alongside the small number of referrals not due to a screening abnormality or clinical indication. Clinics were only able to report the ‘other’ category as a whole and this was taken as an indication for <abbr title="high-risk human papillomavirus">HR-HPV</abbr> positive with negative referrals. It is therefore possible that actual practice is better than the performance reported here.</p>

<p>The minimum rate reported was 7.5%.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Terminology</h2>

<p>Cervical screening is offered to women between the ages of 24 years and 6 months and 64 years. Over 3 million women are tested in England every year.</p>

<p>Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (<abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr>) is the medical term for abnormal cells in the cervix. <abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr> is not cancer, but it can sometimes go on to develop into cancer.</p>

<p><abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr> is graded <abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr> 1, 2 or 3, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr> 1 (low grade) means the abnormality is unlikely to develop into cancer as the cells will often go back to normal on their own</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr> 2 or 3 (high grade) means there is a greater chance the cells could develop into cancer; women with <abbr title="cervical intraepithelial neoplasia">CIN</abbr> 2 or 3 are usually offered treatment</li>
  <li>cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (<abbr title="cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia">CGIN</abbr>), also known as adenocarcinoma in situ, is an abnormality of the glandular tissue in the cervix; for any grade of <abbr title="cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia">CGIN</abbr>, a woman will be offered treatment</li>
