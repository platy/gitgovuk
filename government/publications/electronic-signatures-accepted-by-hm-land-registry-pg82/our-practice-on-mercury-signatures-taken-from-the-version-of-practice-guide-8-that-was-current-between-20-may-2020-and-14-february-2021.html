<h2>
<span class="number">12 Mercury </span> signatures</h2>

<p>The Law Commission report “Electronic execution of documents” (Law Com No 386), published in September 2019, endorsed an approach put forward by the Law Society in a practice note “Execution of documents by virtual means” that was originally produced in 2009. The Law Society had advocated this approach as a “prudent” one to be taken in the execution of deeds (whether by an individual or on behalf of a company) where the parties were not all present on completion of a transaction. The form of signature involved was a scanned manuscript signature being added to the final version of the deed. The approach was set out in the practice note and referred to by the Law Society, and subsequently by the Law Commission, as “option 1”.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry will, until further notice, accept for the purposes of registration a transfer and certain other deeds (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-that-can-be-mercury-signed">Deeds that can be Mercury signed</a>) signed in accordance with option 1. The steps involved in option 1 where a transfer is involved are the following (and the same steps will apply similarly for other deeds):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 1 - Final agreed copies of the transfer are emailed to each party by their conveyancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 2 - Each party prints the signature page only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 3 - Each party signs the signature page in the physical presence of a witness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 4 - The witness signs the signature page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 5 - Each party sends a single email to their conveyancer to which are attached the final agreed copy of the transfer (see STEP 1) and a PDF/JPEG or other suitable copy of the signed signature page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 6 - The conveyancing transaction is completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 7 - The conveyancer applies to register the disposition and includes with the application the final agreed copy of the transfer and the signed signature page or pages in the form of a single document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 8 - The application is processed by HM Land Registry following standard operating procedure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The conveyancers involved will clearly need to agree to option 1 being used before the process starts.</p>

<p>Note that witnessing is required in exactly the same way as it is for any document to constitute a deed: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#attestation-by-a-witness">Attestation by a witness</a>.</p>

<p>The Law Commission agreed with the view in the practice note that “the PDF (or Word) final version of the document and the PDF of the signed signature page (both attached to the same email) will constitute an original signed document and will equate to the ‘same physical document’ referred to in Mercury.”  This is a reference to R (Mercury Tax Group Ltd) v HMRC [2008] EWHC 2721 (Admin) where Underhill J (as he then was) set out section 1(3) of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 and expressed his agreement with Counsel “that that language necessarily involves that the signature and attestation must form part of the same physical document” being signed. This is why the form of signature used in option 1 is often referred to as a “Mercury PDF” signature: it is a form of signing settled on as a response to comments in Mercury.</p>

<p>The combining of the transfer and signature pages in STEP 7 may be done either by their being (i) electronically combined or (ii) printed out and then physically combined.  The conveyancer must certify the resulting transfer as a true copy of the original in the usual way.  For the purposes of the certificate, the single document produced by a conveyancer combining the final agreed transfer and signature pages is to be treated as the original transfer. The same applies for the other deeds listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#deeds-that-can-be-mercury-signed">Deeds that can be Mercury signed</a>.</p>

<p>The application for registration can be made through the electronic Document Registration Service.  If there has been electronic combination, the combined deed such as a transfer and signature pages can be directly uploaded as a single document; if there has been physical combination, the combined pages can be scanned as a single document.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the application can be made in paper form.  A copy of the single combined document constituting the executed transfer will need to be lodged: if electronically combined, the resulting document can be printed out.</p>

<p>A plan included in a transfer of part or other deed dealing with part of the land in a registered title must be signed by the transferor or other disponor: rule 213(2) of the Land Registration Rules 2003. The disponor’s conveyancer might, therefore, sign the plan (perhaps by a typed in signature) as agent for the disponor before emailing them in Step 1, so that the final execution copy of the deed sent to the disponor includes the signed plan. Conveyancers would obviously need to satisfy themselves that that they were duly authorised to sign as agent. Alternatively, the disponor might type in their name on the plan by way of signature before returning the final agreed copy of the deed (including the now-signed plan) and the signed signature page or pages to the conveyancer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> Deeds that can be Mercury signed</h3>

<p>HM Land Registry will, for the time being, accept for the purposes of registration the following deeds that have been signed in accordance with option 1.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A deed that effects one of the dispositions referred to in section 27(2) and (3) of the Land Registration Act 2002.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A discharge or release in form DS1 or form DS3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Equivalent deeds in respect of unregistered land.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A power of attorney other than a lasting power of attorney (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#lasting-powers-of-attorney">Lasting powers of attorney</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will also accept an assent of registered or unregistered land signed in accordance with option 1 – without Step 4 if the assent is not made by deed.</p>

<p>In all cases, the parties to the deed (or assent) must be represented by a conveyancer.</p>
