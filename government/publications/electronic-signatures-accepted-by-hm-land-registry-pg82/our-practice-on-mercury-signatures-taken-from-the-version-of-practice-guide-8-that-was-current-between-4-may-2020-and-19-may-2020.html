<span class="number">12 Mercury </span> signing</h2>

<p>The Law Commission report “Electronic execution of documents” (Law Com No 386), published in September 2019, endorsed an approach put forward by the Law Society in a practice note “Execution of documents by virtual means” that was originally produced in 2009.  The Law Society had advocated this approach as a “prudent” one to be taken in the execution of deeds (whether by an individual or on behalf of a company) where the parties were not all present on completion of a transaction.  The form of signature involved was a scanned manuscript signature being added to the final version of the deed.  The approach was set out in the practice note and referred to by the Law Society, and subsequently by the Law Commission, as “option 1”.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry will, until further notice, accept for the purposes of registration a transfer or other dispositionary deed signed in accordance with option 1.  The steps involved in option 1 where a transfer is involved are the following (and the same steps will apply similarly for other dispositionary deeds):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 1 - Final agreed copies of the transfer are emailed to each party by their conveyancer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 2 - Each party prints the signature page only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 3 - Each party signs the signature page in the physical presence of a witness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 4 - The witness signs the signature page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 5 - Each party sends a single email to their conveyancer to which are attached the final agreed copy of the transfer (see STEP 1) and a PDF/JPEG or other suitable copy of the signed signature page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 6 - The conveyancing transaction is completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 7 - The conveyancer applies to register the disposition and includes with the application the final agreed copy of the transfer and the signed signature page or pages in the form of a single document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>STEP 8 - The application is processed by HM Land Registry following standard operating procedure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The conveyancers involved will clearly need to agree to option 1 being used before the process starts.</p>

<p>Note that witnessing is required in exactly the same way as it is for any document to constitute a deed: see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/execution-of-deeds/practice-guide-8-execution-of-deeds#attestation-by-a-witness">Attestation by a witness</a>.</p>

<p>The Law Commission agreed with the view in the practice note that “the PDF (or Word) final version of the document and the PDF of the signed signature page (both attached to the same email) will constitute an original signed document and will equate to the ‘same physical document’ referred to in Mercury.”  This is a reference to R (Mercury Tax Group Ltd) v HMRC [2008] EWHC 2721 (Admin) where Underhill J (as he then was) set out section 1(3) of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 and expressed his agreement with Counsel “that that language necessarily involves that the signature and attestation must form part of the same physical document” being signed. This is why the form of signature used in option 1 is often referred to as a “Mercury PDF” signature: it is a form of signing settled on as a response to comments in Mercury.</p>

<p>The combining of the transfer and signature pages in STEP 7 may be done either by their being (i) electronically combined or (ii) printed out and then physically combined.  The conveyancer must certify the resulting transfer as a true copy of the original in the usual way.</p>

<p>The application for registration can be made through the electronic Document Registration Service.  If there has been electronic combination, the combined transfer and signature pages can be directly uploaded as a single document; if there has been physical combination, the combined transfer and signature pages can be scanned as a single document.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the application can be made in paper form.  A copy of the single combined document constituting the executed transfer will need to be lodged: if electronically combined, the resulting document can be printed out.</p>
