<p>Vivienne Stern, Director, Universities UK International, provided a brief overview of <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> membersâ assessment of Europe as a region of interest for the sector and an analysis of the expected impact of the change in the UK-EU relationship on education exports.

<span class="number">7. </span> Updates from <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members</h2>

<h3>British Council</h3>

<p>The British Council are developing plans for a Global Alumni Programme, in line with Action 10 in the International Education Strategy: 2021 update.</p>

<p>Market research has been conducted and the research will be shared with the sector soon. The programme will build upon existing alumni programmes and in-country face-to-face activity and provide a core digital offer for UK alumni worldwide. It is currently being designed â the initial offer is likely to comprise a mix of curated social network communities, newsletters, online conferences, webinars, and professional development opportunities.</p>

<h3>British Educational Suppliers Association (<abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The focus on <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> in the International Education Strategy: 2021 update has been very well received by education suppliers as this is a market of huge opportunity. The sector would also be interested in involvement with the Global Education Summit in July.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Action 8: DIT to share information on possible sector involvement in the Global Education Summit in July with ESAG members.</p>
</div>

<h3>Council of British International Schools (<abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The schools sector appreciates the support from government expressed in a recent ministerial letter. <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> also strongly supports the introduction of <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>English UK</h3>

<p>English UK has repeated the survey measuring the impact of Covid-19 on the UK ELT sector. Findings show a dramatic impact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>student numbers fell by 79% in 2020 compared to 2019</li>
  <li>the overall loss in gross revenue (as a direct result of the impact of COVID-19) for all English UK members exceeded Â£590 million in 2020</li>
  <li>91% of all staff working for English UK member centres have been furloughed, released or had their hours or pay cut as a direct result of COVID-19. By the end of 2020, 54% of all staff had been released</li>
  <li>surveyed member centres are less optimistic about 2021 than in the previous survey undertaken in July 2020, when 31% of respondents anticipated a 40% recovery and 43% expected a 60% recovery of their pre COVID-19 business volume. Now, 36% of respondents do not expect recovery to exceed 20% in 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>Universities UK International</h3>

<p>With just under 5,000 students from UK universities from COVID-19 red list countries still outside the UK, universities are offering capacity to quarantine arriving students. Minister Donelan outlined that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> are engaging with Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on this matter.</p>

<h2>
