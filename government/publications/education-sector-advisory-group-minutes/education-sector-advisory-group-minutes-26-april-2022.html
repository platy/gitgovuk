<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/alex-burghart">Minister Burghart</a> welcomed everyone to his first Education Sector Advisory Group (<abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>) as chair and gave a brief update that:</p>

  </li>

    <p>the Education World Forum (EWF) in May is an opportunity to showcase UK education and ministers look forward to engaging with overseas counterparts on improving education, employability and positive work outcomes across nations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>  International Education Strategy (<abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>) next steps; education export risks and opportunities; and international education champion update</h2>

<p>We are making good progress on the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> ambitions. Latest data confirms the 600,000 ambition was met for the first time in the 2020 to 2021 academic year. There were 605,130 international students studying in the UK and on education exports and £25.2 billion was generated for the UK economy in 2019.</p>

<p>A discussion on education export risks covered the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diversification of international recruitment</li>
  <li>importance of a coherent UK offer and brand building</li>
  <li>impact of EU exit on the English language sector</li>
  <li>importance of balancing export considerations with domestic policy developments</li>
</ul>

<p>There are opportunities around technical and level 3 qualifications, building skills, support for International Qualified Teacher Status (iQTS) and for recognition of other accreditation schemes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Action 1:</strong> ESAG members to share further information with officials for consideration on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>new HE providers and visa sponsorship</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current immigration system for level 3 and 4 qualifications</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Sir Steve confirmed his engagement continues with 457 meetings to date of which 121 were international. Planned trips over the coming months include Saudi Arabia 7 to 11 May, Nigeria 15 to 20 May and India 6 to 9 June. Sir Steve will also engage in Education World Forum, 22 to 25 May, and the Commonwealth Games on 29 July. He noted the importance of reducing market access barriers and acknowledged that removing barriers, such as qualification recognition, can take time. He stressed that he was keen to represent the whole of the UK education export sector in his overseas engagements.</p>

<p><abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members made suggestions for longer term activities for Sir Steve. This included the benefits of an all-sector approach to missions/visits and promoting the UK as a study destination, including articulation of how education benefits employment outcomes.</p>

<p>The group also discussed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support across the sector for Ukraine involving twinning between UK and Ukraine universities</li>
  <li>English language beyond <abbr title="English to speakers of other languages">ESOL</abbr> (English to Speakers of Other Languages)</li>
  <li>sector collaboration to tackle isolation</li>
  <li>British schools</li>
  <li>Technical and Vocational Education and Training (<abbr title="Technical and vocational education and training">TVET</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Education Technology">EdTech</abbr> (Educational Technology)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Opportunities for Nigeria</h2>

<p>As one of Sir Steve’s priority countries, Nigeria has education export opportunities, but regional market access barriers exist. Sir Steve is leading the mission in May to focus on scoping barriers and laying the foundations for <abbr title="Transnational education">TNE</abbr> for a further visit later in the year. Helen Grant, MP, is joining the mission in her capacity as the PM’s Special Envoy on Girls’ Education. Scott McDonald, British Council <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>, is also joining part of the mission.</p>

<p>British Council noted that supporting preparations for Sir Steve Smith’s mission has been a priority and outlined export and development opportunities in Nigeria. Nigeria’s young and growing population is creating significant demand for international education, research partnerships, teacher development and English language. Research reports and opportunities for long-term sustainable partnerships have been commissioned.</p>

<p><abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members discussed opportunities for the visit and future engagement in Nigeria, noting that independent schools are a good pathway for Nigerian students into <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr>. Providers have previously encountered some practical issues with partnerships and emphasised the need to work collectively on this longer term.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Any other business</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> sector reported issues encountered by some providers with the new Turing application system. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> agreed to investigate further.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Action 2:</strong> UUKi to send details to DfE officials of specific issues reported by the sector on the Turing application system.</p>
