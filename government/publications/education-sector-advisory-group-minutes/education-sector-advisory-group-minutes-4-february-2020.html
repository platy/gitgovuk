<h2>International Education Strategy implementation update</h2>

<p>Geoff Gladding (Education Sector Team Lead, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>) and Jack Thomlinson (International Higher Education, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) reported on progress on implementing the International Education Strategy (IES) to date.</p>

<p>Jack reiterated to the Group that appointing a high-profile International Education Champion (IES action 1) is a priority and promised to keep the Group updated on any progress. Jack discussed IES actions 3 and 4, which focus on promoting a welcoming environment for international students. He explained that the most recent HESA data shows a significant increase in the number of international students in the UK, with UCAS data showing an increase in applications, in particular from India. Jack discussed IES collaboration across government (IES action 6), both through this Group, as well as the IES Implementation Group consisting of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and the Home Office, and the IES Cross-Government Steering Committee whose members also include the devolved administrations. Finally, Jack went over the education exports data for 2017, which were published in December 2019. These data show an increase in total education exports from £19.9 billion in 2016 to £21.4 billion in 2017. Jack explained that <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> analysts are keen to continue to engage with the members of the Group on education exports data, and outlined the proposed research that will take place looking at the value of TNE.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> thanked <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> analysts for their recent meeting. <abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> think that there is a lack of data around in-country education provision in skills and are keen to work with providers to build the available data. <abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> also raised the issue that Ofqual data only captures regulated qualifications. The Group discussed the difficulty of defining the boundaries of the education sector, particularly when it comes to education consultancy.</p>

<p>Geoff updated the group on the progress that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have made with the Study UK campaign (IES action 2). <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have been working with the British Council to increase their involvement in deciding the campaign’s priorities.</p>

<p>Action 1: <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will update on the GREAT campaign more generally at the next meeting of the Group on 21 April 2020.</p>

<p>Geoff and Jack also explained the progress that has been made so far looking at new actions for this year’s annual review of the IES. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will be identifying new markets, explaining their work with multilateral development banks, and considering new focus on some additional education sub-sectors. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have been looking at improving the international student experience, from the application process, all the way through to graduate outcomes and employability. Both departments are considering the best ways of utilising system-to-system development opportunities with a view to developing close trading partners in the longer term. Finally, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> have been reviewing their country priorities.</p>

<p>Action 2: <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to share their paper on priority countries with the Group.</p>

<p>Mr Stuart then invited <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> and <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> to explain their strategic thinking on future government and sector activity. They would like the sector to be able to feed in more effectively, both on future trade agreements and on government priority markets. In particular, they see increased opportunity for the government to help reduce barriers to trade across the world. They think there would be benefit in improved cross-sector communication, in particular in maximising opportunities at EWF and other UK-based events. They suggested that government influence and expertise could be used to help unlock large-scale funding sources such as multilateral development banks, and also made suggestions around TAP grants and the strategic use of scholarship schemes.</p>

<p>Action 3: Group members to put together a full paper on these proposals to be shared with officials and ministers before the 21 April meeting.</p>

<h2>Looking forward in 2020 – UK government update on future activity</h2>

<p>Geoff detailed upcoming UK government activity. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will be receiving a delegation from the Asian Development Bank, including delegates both from their headquarters in Manila as well as regional education leads from South East Asia. There are also upcoming schools and university missions to Saudi Arabia. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will keep the group posted on events in regions affected by coronavirus.</p>

<p>Action 4: <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> to share a grid of 2020 activity with the Group.</p>

<h2>Free trade agreements and the education sector</h2>

<p>Miranda Dawkins (Deputy Director, Cross-Cutting Policy, Trade Policy Group, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>) updated the Group on <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s work on future free trade agreements. She explained that Trade Policy Group exists to develop policy on trade in goods, services, intellectual property, investment, digital trade and other broader regional considerations, to be used in trade agreement negotiations in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. There was a single detailed education response to consultations on free trade agreements 18 months ago, but we are now looking to start negotiations. As such, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> would like to know what opportunities and threats the sector sees in these negotiations.</p>

<p>Both <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> and <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> have done some research into free trade agreements that they would be happy to discuss with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>. <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> believe that digital terms are often more favourable than terms on other education resource. There was some concern that the questions were not well understood during the consultation 18 months ago. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> have also been in contact with their counterpart organisation in Australia.</p>

<p>Action 5: <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> Education team to facilitate further meetings between Trade Policy Group and the Education sector.</p>

<h2>Updates from members</h2>

<p>Mr Stuart invited the members of the group to give short verbal updates, further to their written contributions.</p>

<p>The British Council discussed Study UK’s work to reconsider their country priorities. They explained the possible disruption to both IELTS and student recruitment that may result from restrictions on exams in China as a result of coronavirus. The British Council also discussed coronavirus’s effects in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> thanked Mr Stuart for attending Bett and praised the cross-government coordination around the show. They also discussed their worries on coronavirus affecting events in Malaysia, Vietnam and Dubai.</p>

<p><abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> discussed their research around teacher supply, as well as the pilot of their accreditation programme for bilingual schools in China which are not currently eligible for BSO accreditation. <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> also explained their ongoing work with the GREAT campaign.</p>

<p>The Early Years Alliance explained that the early years sector remains more interested in trade in training and software than in overseas delivery. They praised EYFS which is envied in other countries, although pointed out that its ongoing revision means that this can be difficult to leverage. They asked that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> continue to work closely with the early years sector around international opportunities for the sector.</p>

<p>English UK provided a short supplementary written update on coronavirus. English UK are concerned about short and medium-term cancellations and postponements of junior groups from China, as well as that the summer will be impacted as the start of the Chinese school term is delayed. They are also worried by the secondary impact caused by students (particularly junior groups) from other countries not travelling to the UK due to health concerns. English UK’s experience is that the market takes some time to recover.</p>

<p>Independent HE showed the group their SME manifesto for higher education. They also raised the issue of delays registering with OfS which could financially impact smaller higher education institutions if they cannot provide Tier 4 visas. Finally, they discussed the issue that independent providers have been running out of CASs.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> explained that following on from their meeting with the GREAT team, they are putting together the visuals for a skills-specific part of the GREAT campaign. They thanked the British Council for working together successfully in Kazakhstan, and that they will be signing a memorandum of understanding in Dubai.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> shared their report on international graduate employability with the group. They explained that the sector has uncertainty around fees and loan access for EU students. In March, <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> will launch a communications campaign across the EU explaining facts about EU exit. They are also looking for funding for a sponsorship scheme for EU students. Finally, <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> discussed the potential effects of coronavirus, explaining that their current focus is on supporting universities with their public health response but there will be a potential financial impact.</p>

<h2>EU Exit Update</h2>

<p>Peter Drummond (Deputy Director, International and EU Exit, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) updated the group. He explained that the UK will continue to follow EU rules and regulations until December 2020, including participation in EU programmes. Negotiations with the EU will start as soon as the EU has agreed its own negotiation mandates. He encouraged the group to look at section 9 (Mobility) and section 15 (Level Playing Field and Sustainability) of the EU’s negotiation directives. He noted that the Political Declaration negotiated alongside the Withdrawal Agreement will serve as a guide for negotiations. Finally, Peter explained that the Department for Exiting the EU has now closed.</p>
