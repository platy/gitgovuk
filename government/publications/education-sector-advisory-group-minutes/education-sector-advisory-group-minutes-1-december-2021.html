<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Welcome and introductions</h2>

<p>As new co-chairs of the Education Sector Advisory Group (<abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>), Mike Freer has taken over from Graham Stuart as Minster for Exports at <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and Alex Burghart has taken over from Michelle Donelan, as Minister for Skills at <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. Today’s chair, Minister Freer welcomed members and invited introductions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> International Education Strategy (<abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>) update</h2>

<p>Zamila Bunglawala, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> outlined that the 2021 <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> update set out 14 new actions to support the path from COVID-19 recovery to sustainable growth. It recommitted to the 2 2030 ambitions to sustainably increase the value of education exports to £35 billion per year and international student numbers to 600,000 per year.</p>

<p>We are grateful for this group’s continued efforts and the good progress made in supporting <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> delivery to achieve the ambitions including:</p>

<h3>International Qualified Teacher Status (<abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Following a public consultation, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will take a pilot approach to the delivery of <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr>. The process to select <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot providers opened on 15 November 2021, with announcement of successful providers in early 2022. The <abbr title="International Qualified Teacher Status">iQTS</abbr> pilot will run for one academic year commencing September 2022.</p>

<h3>Turing Scheme</h3>

<p>The Turing Scheme will provide opportunities for participants from schools, colleges and universities to study and work across the globe. Under the programme, providers successfully applied for funding to cover over 41,000 individual placements overseas across the academic year 2020 to 2021. COVID-19 will impact mobility and student journey and welfare aspects will be taken on board. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> are working closely in partnership with <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> and British Council.</p>

<h3>Improving the student journey</h3>

<p>We are committed to ensuring the UK is the destination of choice for international students, including through developing an alumni platform, roundtables on student employability opportunities and the <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> launch of the Myriad system in November 2021.</p>

<h3>Education exports data</h3>

<p>Robust data is key. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, with support from Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>), are working with London School of Economics (<abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr>) to improve the accuracy and methodology. We will ensure <abbr title="London School of Economics">LSE</abbr> engage with the Group / sector to understand the challenges. Minister Freer thanked the group for their involvement so far and stressed the importance of continuing that engagement. <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> workshops were highlighted.</p>

<p>When sourcing data, English UK usually go to members directly. The same applies to the UK Skills Partnership (<abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr>), for example the Federation of Awarding Bodies (FAB) have had an annual survey for a number of years and have a better view on qualifications. It was noted that the skills sector has the appetite to be more closely involved in official statistics. <abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> is attempting data breakdowns but face challenges, including some reluctance to share data. It is important that a good case is made for this. <abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> are hoping for results in the next 6 months on this work.</p>

<p>Quantifying how much of overseas schools’ income comes back needs to be addressed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> said a breakdown of data by subsector would help and <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> is looking to strengthen data from their end. Latest education exports figures will be published later in December.</p>

<p><abbr title="Independent Higher Education">IHE</abbr> asked if more can be done to support small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) (English Language Teaching (<abbr title="English Language Teaching">ELT</abbr>) and <abbr title="Independent Higher Education">IHE</abbr>). Minister Freer confirmed there are 2 separate strands in the Exports Strategy - on Export Champions and International Trade Advisers (ITAs) - and advised contacting <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> if more can be done.</p>

<h3>Free trade agreements (<abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr>)</h3>

<p>One of this government’s key priorities is to secure world class <abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr> across the world, to benefit both UK businesses and consumers. It is important that we continue to support the education sector and promote education in <abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> have been engaging with the sector to understand export priorities for countries where we are negotiating <abbr title="free trade agreements">FTAs</abbr>, and to facilitate input into <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> public consultations.</p>

<p>Most recently, we have run information sessions as part of the Gulf-Cooperation Council <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr> public consultation for <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members and a range of other education stakeholders. Group members were encouraged to input into this consultation. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s trade council consultation in January was highlighted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Deep dive on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (<abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr>) region</h2>

<p>Emily Hamblin, Head of <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> in Vietnam and Deputy Regional Director for Trade provided a review of work that both Her Majesty’s Government (HMG) and the education sector have conducted in the region in 2021 to promote UK education exports and highlighted the opportunities in the region for 2022. This was followed by a group discussion facilitated by Sir Steve Smith.</p>

<p><abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr> will be a high value region for education. <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> have adopted Trade Commissioner Natalie Black’s recommendations, as reflected in the International Education Strategy. An official visit from <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> to Indonesia is planned for the Spring.</p>

<p>There is an overall sense of a step change in engagement following the Integrated Review, the Indo-Pacific tilt and the recent achievement of <abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr> dialogue partner status; evidenced in Vietnam by 7 ministerial visits and a refreshed strategic partnership and the <abbr title="free trade agreement">FTA</abbr>. There needs to be a rebalance for some areas post-COVID-19.</p>

<p><abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr> is a diverse region, including ‘big hitters’ and ‘rising stars’, all in need of high-quality education - transnational education (TNE), joint partnerships, quality EdTech, English language and the need for recognition of qualifications.</p>

<p>There has been good growth, and targets have been exceeded this year with £75 million worth of export wins across 50 deals. We should make better use of development funds for the rising stars; in particular via the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) merger has created Official Development Assistance (ODA) opportunities. Challenges include the impact of COVID-19 and the uncertainty around mobility, particularly the mass exodus of teachers across the region.</p>

<p>Whitehall departments each have an education agenda. Also, education is one of 3 pillars of the development plan as a dialogue partner. At a country level, we need to join up more across <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and British Council. Supporting partnership agreements is a long-term process requiring staying power in order to see results, for example 2 UK schools, Uppingham and Reigate Grammar, now set up in Vietnam, resulted from initial conversations in 2018 to 2019; so relationships take time to flourish.</p>

<p>Minister Freer asked how we could go about undertaking a competitor analysis. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr>’s report on why UK has lost market share was highlighted along with the idea of a 3-year post study visa, which was suggested could make the UK more competitive.</p>

<p>Sir Steve re-affirmed that opportunities in the <abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr> region look enormous across the breadth of the education sector, but with particular interest in schools, skills and English language. Steve is attending the Wilton Park Dialogue and hopes to take a delegation of <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> institutions relating to Vietnam’s needs (of interest particular to Scotland/Wales). There is opportunity for group members to join Sir Steve on missions to the region, including Indonesia where already 40+ education providers have found opportunities.</p>

<p>Southeast Asia is a big area of interest for the British Council where they are engaging with 7 out of 10 countries – mostly on <abbr title="English Language Teaching">ELT</abbr>. Strong in most countries, less so in Cambodia and Brunei. They have been holding a series of big events on SE Asia and have produced a report that analyses 7 markets in the region to help inform considerations of the UK offer.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> is keen to follow up with Sir Steve on his plans for BETT Asia as they run the UK Pavilion.</p>

<p><abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> were delighted that Reigate Grammar and Uppingham schools were highlighted as examples of UK schools opening campuses in Vietnam - both joined a <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> Vietnam mission which resulted in their success. From a schools’ perspective, student success is about good education standards and high-quality teachers, so promotion of IQTS is key; in addition to reducing barriers to access teacher training. The investors that <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> met in Vietnam wanted reassurance that the school brand is a quality one in order to attract fee paying students. <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> are proud to be involved with British Council, helping to connect <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> with student recruitment to ensure students are fully briefed on how to access UK <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>, including safeguarding aspects.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> have undertaken deep dives for Indonesia and Vietnam. They are working with Global Wales on promotional efforts, and British Council on Study UK.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Action 1</strong>: To share details of trade missions (including dates) including Vietnam, Indonesia and potential India mission [DfE/DIT].</p>

<h3>Dubai Expo</h3>

<p>The new Omicron COVID variant is impacting planning and creating unease about travel abroad. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> are considering slimming back the programme and moving where possible to virtual / hybrid. They are hoping the De Montfort event will remain a physical one. Sir Steve is still planning to go.</p>

<h3>Hungary scholarships</h3>

<p>English UK are working with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> on the previously highlighted Hungarian English language project which will go ahead in 2022. They noted that it has the potential to increase the number of student weeks from 2,000 to 180,000. The project will have a knock-on effect for other sectors - FE, <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr>, tourism.</p>

<h3>Date of next meeting</h3>

<p>14 March 2022, 11am to 12.30pm.</p>
