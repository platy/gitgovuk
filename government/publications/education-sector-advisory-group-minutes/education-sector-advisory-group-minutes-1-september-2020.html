<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Overview of International Education Strategy Review</h2>

<p>3.1
Minister Donelan thanked sector members for their input into the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review to date.</p>

<p>The minister reiterated the government’s headline targets of increasing education exports to £35 billion and increasing international student numbers to 600,000, both by 2030.</p>

<p>She set out the changed global context in which the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review is being conducted. She cited the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK’s departure from the EU and the wider programme of work across government and the key achievements that have already taken place since 2019.</p>

<p>The minister explained that the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review will detail how government has supported the sector, including through financial support measures and support for international students throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>She further explained that the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review key themes will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building global partnerships</li>
  <li>setting out the International Education Champion’s agenda</li>
  <li>international student experience</li>
  <li>internationalisation and increasing education exports</li>
  <li>setting out the opportunities for the sector as a result of the UK leaving the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>The government is hoping to publish the review in the autumn but will keep this timing under review to ensure that the document is published at the most appropriate time.</p>

<p>Minister Donelan then invited the sector to share its views:</p>

<p>3.2 <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> raised the point that enhancing the student experience needs to begin before the point of application to British universities with, for example, a large number of applicants attending British-style schools overseas.</p>

<p>3.3 <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> emphasised the importance of the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review including an update on progress of delivery against the actions in the 2019 strategy. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> also stressed 2 further points, including: the end of the UK’s transition period out of the EU and the hope that this would be covered in the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>; as well as the introduction of the new visa regime, which has many advantages. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> stressed the need for effective communications going forward.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> asked for information on timings of the government’s Integrated Review and Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

<p>3.4 Shahid Omer, Deputy Director for International Higher Education at DFE, reassured that the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review will include a focus on reviewing progress against 2019 actions.</p>

<p>3.5 Independent HE (<abbr title="Independent HE">IHE</abbr>) indicated that support with regards to diversification of the education sector’s export markets was welcomed and believed there was a need to diversify the sector’s provider base as well. <abbr title="Independent HE">IHE</abbr> raised a point regarding the end of the UK’s transition period, noting that there are providers who have not yet taken necessary procedural steps to prepare for the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>Minister Donelan has spoken to Minister Stuart regarding this point and suggested that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, <abbr title="Home Office">HO</abbr> / <abbr title="UK Visas and Immigration">UKVI</abbr> work with the Office for Students (<abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Action 1: <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, <abbr title="Home Office">HO</abbr> / <abbr title="UK Visas and Immigration">UKVI</abbr> to work with <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> on ensuring providers are engaging with <abbr title="Home Office">HO</abbr> / <abbr title="UK Visas and Immigration">UKVI</abbr> on visa requirements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Proposals for sector join up in support of <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> and the International Education Strategy</h2>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> presented an update on behalf of sector members.</p>

<p>4.1 <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> stressed that the sector viewed this work as a shared endeavour, and that the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review should set out not only what the government can do to support, but also to drive, the sector to align behind shared goals.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> conveyed that the sector has made a positive start in working more closely as a consortium. It also opined that government departments have been working more closely over the past year and that this has been reflected in a number of positive policy announcements, such as the graduate route. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> commented that this is making a clear and positive impact, and that these policies may be cushioning the sector from the worst effects of COVID-19. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> noted, however that there is still room for even greater collaboration.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> pointed to 5 key action areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying priority markets. The sector committed to putting forward a list of suggested priority countries, concentrating efforts on a group of no more than 10 countries</li>
  <li>setting clear objectives for these markets</li>
  <li>better cross-sectoral planning</li>
  <li>working closely as a sector to present a coherent, cross-sectoral UK education offer. The sector committed to working more closely to produce and share better insight and intelligence. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> noted that work on showcasing the UK’s offer would begin virtually until such time as travel is more possible.</li>
  <li>supporting the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> review and the work of the International Education Champion. The sector suggested using <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> as a forum through which to regularly update on progress against its actions.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> also raised an ambition to see financial support packages for exporters and potential exporters and for incentivising study in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> also noted that a key part of the sector working more closely would be drafting joint submissions for key government reviews and committed to submit one for the government’s upcoming comprehensive spending review.</p>

<p>The sector will meet monthly in order to continue this way of working. By the end of September, it will have drafted a cross-sectoral ‘forward look’ of upcoming opportunities, including its suggestions for government intervention where it deems it appropriate.</p>

<p>4.2 <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> expanded on the point regarding cross sectoral, virtual showcases, opining that, while physical travel is likely to restart at some point in the future, attitudes to travel may have changed in the long term, commenting that the sector and government could maximise this opportunity.</p>

<p><abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> put forward the idea of creating a digital platform, owned by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Government">HMG</abbr>, and in which the UK could showcase its education offer in a comprehensive way. This might be followed by cross-sectoral virtual missions, showcasing the UK’s offer to key foreign ministries and sectors.</p>

<p>4.3 UK Skills Partnership (<abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr>) then presented the sector’s update on a ‘One Stop Shop’ idea, which would allow the sector to bid for tenders as one. <abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> also emphasised the need to align this with government priorities.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Action 2: Minister Donelan committed to consider this proposal when submitted.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> International Education Champion priorities</h2>

<p>Geoff Gladding, Sector Lead, Education, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, highlighted the following points.</p>

<p>Sir Steve Smith has engaged with each of the sector organisations on the call and with the devolved administrations in his programme of induction.</p>

<p>Discussions focused on opportunities of scale and areas in which Sir Steve will be able to effect a real difference. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will now continue to work with Sir Steve and colleagues overseas to develop his programme of work even further and his engagements will begin virtually, until travel restrictions are lifted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Regional strategies and Asia Pacific deep-dive</h2>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/natalie-black">Natalie Black, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Trade Commissioner">HMTC</abbr> for Asia-Pacific</a></li>
  <li>Kara Owen, High Commissioner, Singapore</li>
  <li>Danny Pruce, HM Ambassador, Philippines</li>
  <li>Lucy Watkins, Deputy Regional Director for East Asia, British Council</li>
</ul>

<p>6.1 Natalie Black led a presentation, setting out the importance of the Asia Pacific region. She explained that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> overseas and HM Trade Commissioners take a cross-country approach in the region and that the team was keen to work closely with the sector.</p>

<p>It was emphasised that while the UK is the current leader in the region it must work to maintain and increase its market share. Heightened by COVID-19, there is a huge demand in the region both in the skills training and <abbr title="education technology">edtech</abbr> sectors.</p>

<p>6.3 <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> indicated that it would be keen to support any work on <abbr title="education technology">edtech</abbr> in this region.</p>

<p>6.4 The Early Years Alliance raised the question of whether there is any early-years specific intelligence or data.</p>

<p>6.5 In response to the presentation, English UK and <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> raised a point on international student recruitment and the potential of holding visa briefings to potential overseas students. Shahid Omer committed to pursuing this proposal with the Home Office.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Gulf Cooperation Council (<abbr title="Gulf Co-operation Council">GCC</abbr>) Joint Trade and Investment Review</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/simon-penney">Simon Penney, HM Regional Trade Commissioner Middle East</a> briefed the group on the <abbr title="Gulf Co-operation Council">GCC</abbr>. He explained that the Gulf is the UK’s third largest export market globally, behind the US and China.</p>

<p>He also informed the group that the UK and <abbr title="Gulf Co-operation Council">GCC</abbr> recently announced UK-<abbr title="Gulf Co-operation Council">GCC</abbr> Joint Trade and Investment Review (<abbr title="Joint Trade and Investment Review">JTIR</abbr>). With the UK now able to pursue independent trade policy, it has an opportunity to utilise other levers in order to further its trade agenda, such as the <abbr title="Joint Trade and Investment Review">JTIR</abbr> mechanism. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will work with the <abbr title="Gulf Co-operation Council">GCC</abbr> secretariat to agree an action plan to boost trade and investment between the regions over coming years.</p>
