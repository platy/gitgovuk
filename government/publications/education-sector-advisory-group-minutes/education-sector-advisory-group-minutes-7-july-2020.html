<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Welcome and introductions</h2>

<p>Minister Stuart welcomed everyone to the meeting. He expressed that the government is well aware of how difficult the previous few months have been for the education sector, and that he looks forward to working with the members of this Group to help the sector bounce back from the impact of COVID-19. Minister Stuart extended a particular welcome to the new International Education Champion, Prof Sir Steve Smith.</p>

<p>Minister Donelan echoed Minister Stuart’s welcome, and added that the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) and Department for International Trade’s (<abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>) focus over the next few months is working towards publishing a review of the International Education Strategy in the autumn and that the Group’s engagement will be hugely helpful in refining that thinking.</p>

<p>Minister Foster introduced himself to the Group. He explained his portfolio around future borders and immigration and that the government is looking towards a new migration system.</p>

<p>Minister Stuart invited each member to introduce themselves and give a short update to the group.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> British Council</h3>

<p>The British Council explained that over the past few months, the paid for services of British Council had stopped, leading to a need for conversations with HM Treasury and <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> around increased public funding. As such, funds may not be available for developed world initiatives. The British Council successfully held Going Global online in June 2020. They have also conducted research around student sentiment, concluding that 40% of prospective students are sitting on the fence; reassurances about health and personal safety are necessary. The government and the British Council should consider how to leverage Study UK to help with the sector’s bounce-back in a collaborative way, and encourage the Department for International Development (DfID) and the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>) to be part of this conversation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> extended their thanks to the Home Office for a run of positive announcements. They noted that the higher education sector is exceptionally grateful and are convinced that those actions have given the sector a fighting chance in recruiting international students for the coming academic year. The sector has been campaigning very hard on this, with Minister Donelan’s support.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> survey found that 97% of institutions are planning some face to face teaching in the coming academic year. The demand picture for the year looked encouraging with UCAS reporting unexpectedly buoyant figures, although it was acknowledged that it will not be known for certain whether those applicants will actually arrive until September/October. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> have conducted some analysis in a report entitled “Why aren’t we second?”, looking at markets where the UK may have lost market share, and shared as a paper at this meeting.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> series of live webinars and Facebook live events, timed to coincide with key policy changes, have been watched by over 200,000 students. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> are also working to make sure universities can implement self-isolation requirements for incoming students.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> <abbr title="Independent HE">IHE</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Independent HE">IHE</abbr> explained that there has been a drastic drop in students on professional short courses and study abroad programmes. Study abroad programmes from March to September have been cancelled, although there is a lack of data on international students attending these programmes, so it is hard to assess the impact economically.</p>

<p><abbr title="Independent HE">IHE</abbr> have focussed on spreading information and communications, as the majority of their members are <abbr title="small or medium-sized enterprise">SME</abbr> providers who lack the resource to stay on top of rapid policy changes; a government ‘one stop shop’ resource for providers of international students bringing together <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, Home Office and other government guidance would be helpful.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> <abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Skills Partnership">UKSP</abbr> told the Group that colleges face similar problems as universities, with potential cancellations from international students in the coming academic year. Colleges are currently working to be able to welcome international students in September, although they expect that there are concerns among students about COVID-19 safety. The Association of Colleges are working to reassure students on this; the sector welcomed the changes announced by the Home Office, which are helpful in showing that the UK will welcome international students next academic year.</p>

<p>Independent training providers (<abbr title="independent training providers">ITPs</abbr>) have private contracts overseas which have almost completely halted, as they cannot be in country to deliver on the contracts. <abbr title="independent training providers">ITPs</abbr>’ loss of apprenticeships in the UK are likely to destabilise the UK market, which in turn impacts international capacity, leading to some providers potentially leaving the market.</p>

<p>There are around 160 awarding organisations in the UK, many very small, and even some of the small providers have international work. Whilst not all awarding organisations will survive, and others are concentrating solely on the UK market, some bodies have seen a noted increase in business as a result in a rise for demand in online assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Twenty-five independent schools in the UK have closed as a direct impact of COVID-19. For those schools overseas, there are particular concerns regarding teacher supply, with restrictions on visas, work permits and travel to/from countries. <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> have also conducted a report into teacher supply in the international schools’ sector, with the findings in their paper circulated for this meeting: this research, based on more than 1,100 survey responses from senior leaders, incoming teachers, and outgoing teachers, provides concrete data about the profile and motivation of teachers entering and leaving the British international school sector, the quality of their experience, the movement between sectors, and the current teacher recruitment climate in international schools. <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> also expressed concerns regarding the management and grading of British public examinations for 2020 and 2021; the potential negative impact of fewer international students; and the potential damage to the reputation of British public examination systems.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> EYA</h3>

<p>Early Years Alliance updated the Group that early years sector had very little international activity, with a focus on providing continuity of care in the domestic market. Developing international activity is off the agenda for early years providers at the present time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span> English UK</h3>

<p>English UK thanked Minister Stuart for his response on the recent adjournment debate around English language schools. Caroline Ansell MP spoke on the difficulties being faced by the English Language Training (<abbr title="English Language Training">ELT</abbr>) sector and there were numerous impassioned interventions. The sector appreciated hearing that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will champion the <abbr title="English Language Training">ELT</abbr> sector across government.</p>

<p>English UK gave the latest statistics regarding the sector’s activity. There has been an 83% drop in the number of students studying English in the UK from January to September 2020. Since March 2020, 84% of employees in <abbr title="English Language Training">ELT</abbr> have been furloughed or released, with an additional 9% of employees working reduced hours.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span> <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr> expressed their pride in terms of the educational suppliers’ sector’s provision of £30 million of support to schools in the UK and internationally. The sector is working on publishing guidance for schools on using technology to get ready for reopening. <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr> thanked <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> for their support on amplifying LendEd, <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr>’s EdTech platform. <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr> are working with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> on plans for virtual trade missions, potentially to new markets, and with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> feeding in on trade policy discussions. <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr> are concerned about state funding of free curriculum resources in UK market, as suppliers cannot sustain making resources free, and moving away from this model will be made more difficult by state funding of free resources. <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr> would like to work with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to propose a range of ways in which costless measures could mitigate this risk.</p>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> International Education Champion: Professor Sir Steve Smith</h2>

<p>Minister Stuart explained his view that Sir Steve’s activity should be focussed on a relatively small number of markets where there are tangible outcomes for him to achieve, where he will have the opportunity to develop substantive relationships and thus make a real difference.</p>

<p>Sir Steve explained that he is excited about his new position as International Education Champion. Sir Steve is an academic in international relations, and the president of a world body in the field, so he is well aware of geopolitical complexities. He has worked closely with <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> over a number of years. He confessed that he needed to learn more about other education sub-sectors but had found his induction into those areas very helpful. He has had uniformly positive conversations and already identified opportunities.</p>

<p>Sir Steve wants to start thinking through interim targets, including target countries, using data around current exports and what can be done to increase these numbers. He would like to be held to account for these targets. Sir Steve will be talking to every member of the group, Ministers Stuart and Donelan, as well as the devolved administrations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Action 2: Every Group member to meet Sir Steve to explain their sector to him and discuss his priorities, targets and initial activity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Sector response to, and prioritising, asks of government around COVID-19</h2>

<p>English UK gave a presentation on behalf of all sector attendees, detailing the impact of COVID-19 on the sector, the sector’s response to this, and the remaining areas in which government could act to support the sector further.</p>

<p>English UK explained the unprecedented impact that COVID-19 has had on the whole of the education sector, and recognised the government’s unprecedented response to the challenge. For example, for one English UK member, at this point last year, they would have had 8,000 students arriving into host families across London; this year, they have two. Revenue is usually £6,000,000 over the period; in 2020 it has been £219 since the end of March.</p>

<p>The sector has responded with innovative solutions by moving education online and making the best use of the education technology available, whilst working hard to market their offers in the new COVID-19 world.</p>

<p>There are three categories of priority asks: financial support from government; regulatory measures particularly in terms of visa reform; and marketing and export promotion measures to help maximise the recovery and sustain it going forward.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Financial support</h3>

<p>One of the obstacles standing in the way of the survival of small institutions is that they are not eligible of the business rates holiday and associated grants offered to the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors despite facing similar difficulties. Jodie sought ongoing support for seasonal businesses until they reach their next peak season next Easter.</p>

<p>The government could explore mechanisms to offer government-backed loans at commercial rates to international students, e.g. though UKEF. Minister Stuart noted that UKEF is looking to launch a new product called the General Export Facility, which should provide support to exporters who do not have a specific export contract.</p>

<p>English UK explained Trade Access Programme (<abbr title="Tradeshow Access Programme">TAP</abbr>) funding is crucial for English UK and <abbr title="British Educational Services Association">BESA</abbr> members, particularly if they are returning to square one in exports. Minister Stuart said that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> are looking at temporarily removing the lifetime cap on grants.</p>

<p>English UK spoke about possible grants for companies short on cash flow.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Borders, visas and immigration</h3>

<p>English UK said that reducing visa application fees would be really important for <abbr title="English Language Training">ELT</abbr> and short course providers. Many students had visas for courses and had paid for a visa, yet are having to re-apply. Institutions do not want to offer refunds to these students, as they want them to come back next year, and so having to pay again for visas is sending the wrong message to these students.</p>

<p>English UK noted again that the Tier 4 visa concessions have been really well received by the sector, and that making these concessions permanent would significantly support recovery. To facilitate the growth of TNE, the Home Office could look to introducing long-term recognition of online and blended learning in Tier 4 visas. Additionally, permanently allowing switching from short-term to long-term study visas without leaving the UK would help both the short course sector and support the pipeline of students into HE.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="English Language Training">ELT</abbr>, 51% of students in the UK are under 18 and often only have ID cards and not passports. Allowing travel on these ID cards in the new immigration system would help support the sector, as would working rights parity between short-term study and other study visas.</p>

<p>Potentially, the expansion of the Graduate route to 3-4 years would bring the UK’s offer in line with competitors such as Australia.</p>

<p><abbr title="Independent HE">IHE</abbr> have identified a backlog of registration applications with the Office for Students and Independent Schools Inspectorate, and clearing this backlog could help to grow the number of licensed sponsors for international students.</p>

<p>Finally, English UK said, government, particularly the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (<abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr>), should be making sure that teachers are able to reach international schools across the world.</p>

<p>Minister Foster explained that there is a history of abuse of work rights for those on short-term study visas, and also that the Home Office has committed to bring to an end to ID card-only travel as it is easy to forge ID cards. However, the Home Office  will continue to look at the experience of visa applications, as well as trying to make monitoring better. He also stressed that in the future immigration system, those applying for the Skilled Worker route will only need employment at school leaver level, i.e. with Level 3 qualifications, making it much easier to qualify under this route.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Marketing and export promotion</h3>

<p>The entire sector is concerned that the perception is that the UK is an unsafe place to be as a result of both COVID-19 and concerns around personal safety; this has been borne out through the results of various surveys of potential and current international students, especially in East Asia where parents are big influences on student decision making. The UK’s COVID-19 metrics don’t compare well with all competitors, but it is important that people feel confident enough to get on planes and travel.</p>

<p>English UK said that the government should look to increase financial support for the Study UK campaign, expanding it to include more priority countries as well as <abbr title="English Language Training">ELT</abbr>, TVET, short courses and boarding schools. This support should also be extended to increasing the Education is GREAT and Skills are GREAT campaigns, with increased trade missions as part of this.</p>

<p>English UK explained that the complete funding of the British Council’s export promotion activity is crucial, as is DfID and <abbr title="Foreign and Commonwealth Office">FCO</abbr> support for TVET exports through prosperity and Official Development Assistance (<abbr title="Official Development Assistance">ODA</abbr>) funding. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> would like to see scholarships, co-funded by the sector, similar to the GREAT scholarships model, as well as a single portal for international students on scholarships and commercial loans.  <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> would like to see increased international teacher training opportunities.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> stressed the British Council, and its international infrastructure, is going to be essential for the sector’s recovery. Additionally, whilst the Study UK campaign has been a really good initiative hamstrung by <abbr title="Official Development Assistance">ODA</abbr> funding, e.g. a third of our students come from Europe, Study UK will need non-<abbr title="Official Development Assistance">ODA</abbr> funding in order to be deployed in Europe and scaled up elsewhere. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> and the British Council are happy to look at how universities can contribute more to the campaign as well, if it receives this increase in the government’s desired scale and government backing.</p>

<p>Minister Adams recognised the key role that the British Council plays in the education sector. He made clear that the government have provided a £20 million non-<abbr title="Official Development Assistance">ODA</abbr> grant and a further £60 million loan to see them through COVID-related financial difficulty. The British Council thanked both <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> and Minister Adams for their support.</p>

<p>Finally, English UK noted that the sector views it as crucial that the government and the sector work to safeguard EU markets in 2021 and beyond.</p>
