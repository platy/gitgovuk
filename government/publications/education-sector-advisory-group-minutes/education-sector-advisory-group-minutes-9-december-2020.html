<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Proposals for sector join up in support of <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> and the International Education Strategy</h2>

<p>Jodie Gray, English UK, spoke on behalf of the <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> sub-group formed by <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members and reported that this group meets monthly to align cross-sector activities and share updates on what is happening across the sectors. This sub-groupâs discussions will inform membersâ contributions to the main <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> meetings moving forwards.</p>

<p>She set out that the sub-group have been focusing on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing a list of country priorities, identifying countries where the greatest impact could be made by the education sub-sectors and which could benefit from interventions from government</li>
  <li>developing a risk register to identify key cross sector risks and mitigations to increase export wins, growth and revenue</li>
  <li>joint activity in the priority countries across the whole education sector</li>
</ul>

<p>Minister Stuart stated that <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is  piloting an Export Academy on the use of digital technology for SMEs, which would use webinars and online resources, and offer certification at the end. There was a positive response to this from <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members.</p>

<p><abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members are keen to complement wider government activity and visits, where relevant.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Action 5: A recurring agenda item will be added for an ESAG sub-group representative to lead a deep dive discussion into one of the sub-groupâs identified risks and its mitigations at each future ESAG meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> International Education Champion priorities</h2>

<p>Sir Steve Smith provided an update on his activities to date and his future priorities in line with the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> update:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strong enthusiasm from the sector about working with the Champion to take forward the education exports agenda and for the scale of the opportunity</li>
  <li>the Champion role must take account of the priorities of the whole UK, including each of the devolved administrations</li>
  <li>important for government and the sector to work together on the priority countries. These have been identified as markets where there is significant growth potential, but where barriers could be addressed.</li>
  <li>international engagement has so far been virtual by necessity but hopes to shift to face to face and international visits over the coming months</li>
  <li>virtual international engagement has taken place with a number of countries to date where there is interest in skills, English language, qualifications, schools, HE and trans-national education (<abbr title="transnational education">TNE</abbr>) with links to technology</li>
  <li>next steps include <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> developing engagement plans for priority countries, and Sir Steve will continue to build relationships with counterparts in the priority countries, engaging with <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members as appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Updates from <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> British Council</h3>

<p>British Council reported that value can be seen from Sir Steveâs role already. Research on the development of HE systems internationally is continuing with <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>, with potential for a new programme on systems reform in education and hubs for the sector to access information on markets in one place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> British Educational Suppliers Association (<abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>British Educational Suppliers Association (<abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>) reported that <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>âs latest member survey (October 2020) projects that the fall in sales as a result of the pandemic will overall not be as low as anticipated, though this varies across different parts of the sector, for example, <abbr title="education technology">EdTech</abbr> is performing well. Building trading relationships without being able to travel has been a challenge and there are longer term challenges on finding online ways to connect suppliers, as well as reconfiguring suppliersâ future relationship with Europe.</p>

<p>Thanks were expressed to Sir Steve for his well-received speech at <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>âs <abbr title="annual general meeting">AGM</abbr> and to <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> for their trade missions and roundtables. Bett - the global meeting place for the education technology community â usually takes place in London in January each year but due to the pandemic will be a virtual âBettFestâ in January 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Council of British International Schools (<abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Council of British International Schools (<abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr>) reported concerns that British Schools Overseas (BSO) inspections have stopped, although some accreditation is still going ahead. There has been a shift of host country students moving from domestic state schools to international schools.</p>

<p>There are growth opportunities in digital, recruitment, <abbr title="education technology">EdTech</abbr> and initial teacher training (ITT). However, there are also challenges ahead to ensure curriculums are positioned to deliver employability and skills needs internationally, and to adapt to the massive growth in online/blended learning. Recognition and promotion of quality will be important as modes of delivery become more varied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Early Years Alliance</h3>

<p>Early Years Alliance reported that there are no significant changes internationally for the sector and their focus remains predominantly on the domestic market. Some overseas interest has been generated in UK early years provision following a recent Early Years report. Early years interest more generally overseas is likely to be in the context of learning from other countriesâ wider education reforms and other countries learning from the UKâs reforms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> English UK</h3>

<p>English UK reported loss of revenue from coronavirus (COVID-19) and estimated loss of 80/90% in English Language student volumes compared to 2019. The seasonality of the sector means that concerns remain for 2021, with hopes for a 60% recovery by summer 2021. English UK expressed pride in the incredible resilience demonstrated by the sector.</p>

<p>English UK sees 2 phases moving forward. The first will see the launch of a road map to rebuild the market with a target to return student volumes by summer 2022 and the second phase will be driven by an ambition to bring the sector global pre-eminence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> Independent HE</h3>

<p>Independent HE reported that onshore recruitment has been steady but there are concerns the pipeline is not quite where it should be for 2021. Independent Higher Education would welcome further discussions with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> regarding growing foreign investment interest and how best to manage this. They would also welcome discussions with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> about the specific needs of SME providers, particularly regarding access to the Quality Assurance Agencyâs Transnational Education services and understanding the regulatory regimes of various markets.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Action 7: DfE and DIT to follow-up with IHE on TNE support for SMEs and foreign investment.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span> UK Skills Partnership</h3>

<p>UK Skills Partnership reported that promoting UK <abbr title="Technical and Vocational Education and Training">TVET</abbr> is helping to raise the profile of the UK Skills sector. Focusing on removing barriers to education regulation would support COVID-19 recovery for awarding bodies.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Action 8: DIT to follow up with UK Skills partnership to discuss the barriers to recognition.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span> Universities UK International (<abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Universities UK International reported that the UK HE sector is in a much better position than originally thought in terms of COVID-19 impacts. A recent enrolment survey of member institutions reported a 23% increase in some areas on student numbers.</p>

<p>To date, the international strand of the #WeAreTogether campaign has reached more than 7 million people; achieved more than 2 million video views; supported a combined audience of 250,000 prospective international students via online events; and helped 67% of surveyed prospective international students feel more confident to continue with their plans to study in the UK after engaging with the campaign.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> expressed concern regarding the impact on EU student numbers post-transition. UUK published detailed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/managing-risks-in-internationalisation.aspx" rel="external">guidance for institutions</a> in October on managing security related risks in the context of internationalisation. <abbr title="Universities UK International">UUKi</abbr> have published research on <abbr title="transnational education">TNE</abbr> and the pipeline from <abbr title="transnational education">TNE</abbr> to onshore recruitment. Their upcoming research will focus on where the UK has lost market share (to be published in summer 2021).</p>

<p>Ed Matheson reported that new rules will apply to trade in education services from 1 January 2021 when the UK leaves the Single Market and Customs Union. Negotiations with the EU are ongoing. We will continue to work with education exporters to help them understand and prepare for these changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Update on the GREAT campaign</h2>

<p>Dan Ramsey provided an update on the GREAT campaign.</p>

<p>The GREAT Britain campaign showcases the whole of the UK, to inspire the world and encourage people to visit, do business, invest and study in the UK. The campaign helps British companies to export for the first time and expand into new markets.</p>

<p>The campaign works in 145 countries across the globe, increasing jobs and growth across many sectors, throughout the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Any other business</h2>

<p>Sir Ciaran expressed his thanks to Ministersâ Stuart and Donelan for their active engagement with <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>, and to <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>/<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> officials and all <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members for his time as a member of the group.</p>

<p>Minister Stuart reported that 9 out of the 10 top exporting countries saw their exports fall in 2019 as a result of global trade tensions, with the UK the only exception. This demonstrated that the UK can succeed even in the toughest times and that the country, including the education sector will recover after COVID.</p>
