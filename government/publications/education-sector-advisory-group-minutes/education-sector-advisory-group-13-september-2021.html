<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Welcome and introductions</h2>

<p>Minister Stuart welcomed everyone to the first in-person Education Sector Advisory Group (<abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>) meeting since the COVID pandemic.</p>

<p>The Minister noted that the pandemic had not slowed the pace of work, and that there had been an extraordinary level of activity. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s renewed drive to boost education exports is building momentum. Whilst this is being led by <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>, it is a collaborative effort with the sector. The Minister thanked sector representatives for their support; going forward this would be invaluable, particularly with amplifying messaging and promoting activities. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> will be looking to make the best use of its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.events.great.gov.uk/website/5744/" rel="external">Aventri events platform</a> to share details of events. The meeting marks the first anniversary of Sir Steve Smith’s tenure as International Education Champion and the Minister took the opportunity to thank Sir Steve for his work so far.</p>

<p>Minister Donelan updated that we continue to work hard to welcome international students. An immediate priority is to support Afghans in rebuilding their lives in the UK. At least £12 million will help to prioritise educational provision for children, school transport, and any specialist teachers. In addition, access to student finance will be important and more details will follow. Scholarships are something that is being worked on. The Turing Scheme will be able to provide funding for more than 41,000 participants from schools, colleges and universities to study and work across the globe during the 2021 to 22 academic year, with grant funding totalling £98 million. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> published guidance on what COVID-related costs the Turing Scheme can cover.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Home Office update on education-related matters</h2>

<p>Immigration Minister Kevin Foster gave an update on the latest Home Office (<abbr title="Home Office">HO</abbr>) issues of relevance to the sector.</p>

<p><abbr title="Home Office">HO</abbr> has, over the last two years, streamlined immigration routes and pathways for international students – the most significant set of changes since reforms to the former Tier 4 route at the outset of the previous decade. Changes have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creation of the Student, Child Student, Short-term Student (English language), Parent of a Child Student and Graduate routes</li>
  <li>folding study of up to 6 months into the visit route, meaning that non-visa nationals no longer require a visa stamp when entering for short courses, as well as not having to make an application in advance of travel</li>
  <li>drafting all new routes in line with the recommendations in the Law Commission’s report on simplifying the Immigration Rules</li>
  <li>expanding the ability to switch between routes in-country</li>
  <li>bringing in a new academic engagement policy that empowers <abbr title="government to government">HE</abbr> providers to determine their own policy for sponsored students</li>
</ul>

<h3>Graduate route</h3>

<ul>
  <li>now live and has been a huge success.</li>
  <li>applications being processed without issues.</li>
  <li>high number of applications but continue to encourage uptake, as we approach the anticipated peak application point.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="UK Visas and Immigration">UKVI</abbr> will continue to work with sponsors to address potential risks or abuse</li>
  <li>Huge strides have been made in addressing past compliance failings. By maintaining this collaborative approach, we can continue to support our new routes</li>
</ul>

<h3>COVID-19 concessions to support the education sector update</h3>

<ul>
  <li>introduction of a series of concessions to support the sector and international students, including extending visas for those unable to leave the UK, to ensure no student is penalised for circumstances outside their control</li>
  <li>extension of concessions on distance learning and Graduate eligibility to 6 April 2022. The concession for those who started courses of up to 12 months in the current academic year is still based on entry before the 27 September 2021</li>
</ul>

<h3>Student applications</h3>

<ul>
  <li>early indications are that there might be a record-breaking surge. The last published statistics put us back above where we were in 2019, pre-COVID</li>
</ul>

<h3>Launch of the Sponsorship Roadmap and plan for Student Sponsorship</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UK’s Points-Based Immigration System: Sponsorship Roadmap is now published. Sets out the package of reforms to the system up to 2024</li>
  <li>plans for sponsorship transformation extend to students and sponsors and we want to engage with the sector to agree how to best deliver reforms to the strategic design of student sponsorship</li>
  <li>now easier for sponsors to have flexibility on how they monitor academic engagement for students studying above degree level and we have absorbed many elements of the Tier 4 Pilot Scheme into the new routes</li>
  <li>we will further improve compliance through better data sharing with sponsors, combined with easier to view information to measure compliance and act where required</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4.International </span> Education Champion ‘One Year on’</h2>

<p>In the last 12 months, Sir Steve has undertaken approximately 240 meetings (mostly virtual due to the pandemic), averaging 20 per month. Most domestic engagement has been linked with <abbr title="government to government">HE</abbr> where there was the most opportunities. Close engagement with the Devolved Administrations has helped to understand the differences in representing the UK.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 restrictions ease, engagement with priority countries will become face to face. Sir Steve’s five immediate priority markets are: India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, and Nigeria. Other important markets include Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Europe, China and Hong Kong. These comprise both established markets and markets that have been identified as having longer term growth potential.</p>

<p>Sir Steve’s personal highlights over the past 12 months have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an in person visit to Saudi Arabia to meet representatives from the Saudi education system to further the partnerships with UK universities, schools and special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) providers</li>
  <li>working with India on how the UK can support their new National Education Policy, including engaging at a state level</li>
  <li>discussing the Vietnamese English language teaching framework with over 200 delegates in a <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> and British Council online conference with Vietnam</li>
  <li>serving as co-chair of the UK/Indonesia Joint Higher Education Working Group</li>
</ul>

<p>The ultimate measures of success will be increased education exports and Sir Steve has made progress with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved relationships with Saudi, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia and gaining a better understanding of their needs.</li>
  <li>supporting cross-departmental working between <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, British Council, <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>.</li>
  <li>increased connections with the education sector and increased awareness of the UK Government support to exports.</li>
  <li>promoted UK education overseas through virtual trade missions and government to government <abbr title="government to government">G2G</abbr> bilateral meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking forward to the next 12 months, Sir Steve would like to build up an engagement plan with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an international, rather than domestic focus.</li>
  <li>devolved administrations to effectively represent the whole of the UK.</li>
  <li>travel abroad to priority countries subject to COVID restrictions</li>
  <li>other important markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Europe, China and Hong Kong</li>
</ul>

<p>Sir Steve was keen to hear from the <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> sector members and ministers on where the focus of his work should be in the next 12 months. Key points raised were as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some favoured sticking to the 5 main markets, with the exception being if there was a PM visit or a large opportunity.</li>
  <li>the importance of mutual recognition of qualifications and prioritisation around this</li>
  <li>UK should take more of a lead on online learning.</li>
  <li>more use of Trade Envoys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Action 1: A verbal update for the Scottish International Education Strategy (<abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>) at the <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> meeting on 1 December followed by a more substantial conversation at <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> meeting in March 2022. (Secretariat to add to the <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> forward look)</p>

<p>Action 2: Create case studies to bring the UK offer to life for engagement with priority countries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> <abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> update</h2>

<p>Emirjona Gjana, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, gave a brief update on progress made against the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> action to develop plans for an International Qualified Teacher Status (<abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>In February 2021, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> launched a public consultation on <abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> which sought views on the proposed framework and viability of <abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> (the outcome is at the link here).</p>

<p>The consultation response launched on 24 August 2021 summarised feedback and announced the introduction of <abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> as a new export opportunity for accredited English ITT providers to deliver high-quality teacher training around the world. Pilot events will be held by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> in September 2021.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will publish guidance on the new <abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> framework on GOV.UK. The first <abbr title="International qualified teacher status">iQTS</abbr> courses will begin in September 2022.</p>

<p>Ed Matheson gave a joint update for <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>/<abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> on FTAs and confirmed any further announcements will be shared with <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>.</p>

<p>Over the summer meetings were held with the sector and thanks were expressed to <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members for encouraging wide participation. These focused on the <abbr title="Free Trade Agreement">FTA</abbr> consultation process for India, Canada and Mexico, and encouraged sector responses. The overall consultation findings will be published in November ahead of negotiations. Further updates, where substantive, will be presented to the next <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr>. Ed asked members to reach out on responses if they have any further input to share.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Updates from <abbr title="Education Sector Advisory Group">ESAG</abbr> members</h2>

<p>With time constraints, members gave brief updates on their respective sectors to supplement their written updates.</p>

<p>British Council – The British Council’s new Chief Executive, Scott McDonald, started on 1st September. BC have been busy with situation in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>British Educational Suppliers Association (<abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>) - With the restart of international travel, <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr>’s priority is working to help suppliers prepare for a return to face-to-face events, the first of which will be GESS Dubai in November. Additionally, keen to ensure that the UK maintains its international position as the leading facilitator of education discussion and working to ensure that both <abbr title="Educational Technology exhibition">BETT</abbr> and <abbr title="Education World Forum">EWF</abbr> resume in a physical setting in January 2022. Whilst awaiting details of any potential replacement to the TAP programme, <abbr title="British Educational Suppliers Association">BESA</abbr> are signposting members to the Internationalisation Fund and making introductions with <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr>’s ITAs to take forward individual export action plans.</p>

<p>Council of British International Schools (<abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr>) – There has been a delay in recognising Covid-19 vaccinations administered overseas; with the detrimental impact that this is having on the recruitment/retention and well-being of staff based overseas, as some face the prospect of a second Christmas not being able to travel back to the UK without disruptive and expensive quarantine challenges.</p>

<p>Action 3: Officials to follow up directly with the team working with the Minister for COVID Vaccine Deployment</p>

<p>The Chinese government continues to tighten regulations connected to the influence of international schools. As a result, established and planned British schools face fresh pressures; connected to visas; curriculum, textbooks, commercial arrangements, operating structure and issuing of licences.</p>

<p>After a period of limited activity, pleased to see that an increasing number of <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> BSO inspections are scheduled for the Autumn. The <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> Patron’s Accreditation and Compliance (PAcc) scheme has been actively throughout the pandemic; with Hungary and Romania now formally recognising the scheme. A MoU relating to the formal recognition of <abbr title="Council of British International Schools">COBIS</abbr> PAcc, has been presented to the Thai Ministry of Education for their consideration.</p>

<p>English UK – Many ELT providers are still struggling; but 86% of members have survived the pandemic – better than expected. Thank you to <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> for support. Projects have been on hold due to the pandemic, such as the Hungarian Foreign Language Programme – now planning for summer 2022, which will be critical for UK ELT sector recovery. Students will be eligible for an English language summer course in either the UK, Ireland or Malta; concerns that we might now lose some of the potentially 90,000 students to the latter.</p>

<p><abbr title="Independent Higher Education">IHE</abbr> – Membership continues to grow, and now includes the College of Medicine and Dentistry and the British Academy of Jewellery bringing the association to 59 member institutions. Members will meet for the first time since the pandemic at <abbr title="Independent Higher Education">IHE</abbr>’s Annual Conference on 12 October in London.</p>

<p>UKSP – Thanked <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> for its support. New working groups have been set up with Jonathan Ledger, <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> <abbr title="Global Technical and Vocational Education and Training">TVET</abbr> Specialist, as secretariat. The British Council is supporting UKSP with funding to enable marketing and insight work (including a three-country study). On the <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr> export data action, British Council is also funding a <abbr title="Global Technical and Vocational Education and Training">TVET</abbr> sector wide survey to identify the value of UK <abbr title="Global Technical and Vocational Education and Training">TVET</abbr> exports over the last year or two; to be delivered by January 2022. There is increasing cross sector involvement of EdTech to design innovative online programmes that can teach skills remotely across a number of traditionally classroom-based industry sectors.</p>

<p>Universities UK International – reported student visa applications down 56% for EU; up 9% for non-EU. Thanked work of Home Office. Students travelling to Spain for their year abroad have been facing difficulties obtaining visas. Many have been unable to get appointments at the Spanish Consulate, and there is a lack of clarity about the rules and guidance. Additionally, there have been delays at the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> Legalisation Office where GP letters have to be certified. UUKi have written to the Spanish Consul General to convey concerns and are in touch with the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office">FCDO</abbr> to register concern at the delays there. UUKi continue to engage with the British Council and members to share updates on these issues, and on issues faced in other EU countries.</p>

<p>Early Years Alliance – attention remains focused on the domestic market and the sector continues to experience reduced interest in international activity. The Alliance has undertaken a survey with providers seeking their views in respect of both domestic and international investment. 8% are currently considering further domestic investment but only 2% are considering international and that relates to training exports. Overseas interest is likely to remain low.</p>

<p>Scotland: The new Scottish Government is committed to producing an International Education Strategy. No indications about themes as yet, but clear that there needs to be alignment with the UK <abbr title="International Education Strategy">IES</abbr>. As such, it was emphasised. that whilst Scottish Universities needed to maintain their individuality, they should be clear that they are part of the wider UK university system.</p>
