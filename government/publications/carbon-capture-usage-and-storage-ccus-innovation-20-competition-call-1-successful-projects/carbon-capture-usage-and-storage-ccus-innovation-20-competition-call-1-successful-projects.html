<p><strong>Electrified Subsea System for offshore <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> storage</strong></p>

<p>Led by Baker Hughes - £2,122,698.59</p>

<p>This project is an experimental research &amp; development to technically qualify an electrified subsea system with simplified structures and flexible pipe to enable largescale offshore <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> storage in <abbr title="carbon capture, usage and storage">CCUS</abbr> projects. Subsea technology is already being used today in projects for the oil &amp; gas industry and will be required for the UK to store enough <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> to reach its decarbonisation goals. This program will enable a lower cost, better performing generation of subsea equipment to improve the economics of <abbr title="carbon capture, usage and storage">CCUS</abbr> projects and enable projects that would not be possible with traditional subsea technology.</p>

<p><strong>Parametric testing of Novel Non-Aqueous Solvent technology with Rotating Packed Beds</strong></p>

<p>Led by Carbon Clean Solutions Ltd in partnership with The University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Doosan Babcock Ltd - £607,126.57</p>

<p>Carbon Clean, Newcastle University’s School of Engineering (NU), and Doosan Babcock (DB) will test the use of rotating packed beds (RPB) process equipment technology and Non-Aqueous Solvent (<abbr title="Non-Aqueous Solvent">NAS</abbr>) technology for point source industrial carbon capture applications. As with conventional carbon capture, <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> will be captured from a flue gas using a solvent (absorption step), and the solvent is then recovered and recycled and a pure <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> stream is produced (stripping step). However, the use of <abbr title="rotating packed beds">RPBs</abbr> and <abbr title="Non-Aqueous Solvent">NAS</abbr> are expected to deliver considerable cost and space advantages over conventional technologies. <abbr title="rotating packed beds">RPBs</abbr> have been validated at the bench-scale and pilot-scale, demonstrating a nine times size reduction in absorber and stripper columns. <abbr title="Non-Aqueous Solvent">NAS</abbr> has been validated from pilot-scale to demonstration-scale and illustrates significant energy reductions.</p>

<p><strong>XLR8 <abbr title="carbon capture and storage">CCS</abbr> Accelerating the deployment of a low cost carbon capture solution for hard to abate industries</strong></p>

<p>Led by C-Capture Ltd in partnership with Wood Group UK Limited, Castle Cement Limited, Glass Futures Ltd and Energy Works (Hull) Limited - £1,723,101.02</p>

<p>C-Capture designs world-leading chemical processes for the capture of carbon dioxide (<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr>). We have developed a post-combustion capture technology that is environmentally benign; extremely robust and suitable for use even within challenging, hard-to-abate industries; and that uses significantly less energy than current commercially available technologies.</p>

<p>Our proposed project will assess the feasibility of deploying C-Capture’s innovative technology within three industries that are essential to the economy but are also major <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> contributors: cement, waste to energy (WtE) and glass. These industries produce emissions that are challenging to decarbonise due to the level and type of impurities in the flue gas.</p>

<p>The project will trial and assess the compatibility of C-Capture’s solvent with real-world flue gas in the cement, WtE and glass industries. Three feasibility studies will be carried out with identified host sites, and carbon capture solvent compatibility units (CCSCUs) will be deployed across six different sites within these industries across the period of the project.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Blue C</strong></p>

<p>Deep Branch Biotechnology Ltd in partnership with Centre For Process Innovation Limited - £4,827,394.93</p>

<p>Deep Branch, one of the UK’s fastest-growing biotechnology scale-ups, has developed Proton™, a radically more sustainable alternative to conventional protein sources for the animal feed industry. The commercialisation of the single-cell protein will tackle the climate emergency and reduce the food industry’s impact on biodiversity loss, as the ingredient has no arable land requirements. In this project, Deep Branch will collaborate with CPI (the Centre for Process Innovation), the UK’s leading technology innovation centre, to significantly reduce the cost of deployment by improving input utilisation and process efficiency. This project culminates in a pre-FEED design for a commercial plant utilising &gt;100 tonnes of carbon dioxide per day.</p>

<p><strong>Turning waste carbon dioxide into value for the surfactants industry</strong></p>

<p>Led by Econic Technologies Ltd in partnership with Unilever plc- £1,000,000.00</p>

<p>There is increasing imperative and demand for fast moving consumer goods, like household cleaning products, to be made sustainably, at price. Econic offers an innovative solution for surfactants producers, an integral component of cleaning products, to utilise captured waste carbon dioxide as a raw material in their production processes. The use of Econic’s catalyst and process technology in the production of non-ionic surfactants allows captured waste <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> to replace up to 40 wt% of traditional fossil fuel based and palm oil derived raw materials in a process that can be retrofitted onto existing production plants.</p>

<p><strong>StrataTrapper: Commercialising breakthrough research on accurate reservoir simulation for subsurface <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> storage</strong></p>

<p>Led Imperial College London in partnership with University of Cambridge, OpenGoSim Ltd, BP International plc, Storegga Limited and Drax Group plc - £959,662.00</p>

<p>Reservoir simulations of injected <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> plumes are central to the successful engineering and management of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> storage. Plume migration rates and direction determine the storage efficiency and significance of potential leakage pathways. The extent of residual and dissolution trapping are quantified through simulation-based history matching. Increasing simulation accuracy can de-risk and lower costs throughout the lifetime of a storage project.</p>

<p>In StrataTrapper we translate cutting edge research on the geological fluid dynamics and trapping of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> into innovative characterisation and modelling software tools that will be used by industry to reduce risks and costs of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> storage projects. The tools will be commercialised through incorporation into the <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> reservoir simulation platform OpenGoSim, in addition to being made opensource. We will demonstrate the applicability of these tools to the Endurance field in the Southern North Sea and the East Mey Site in the Central and Northern North Sea. The result of the work will be the commercialisation of the StrataTrapper reservoir simulation tools for the rapid screening, risking, project design, and management of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> storage</p>

<p><strong>BioReact Carbon Formate - Continuous Capture of Industrial <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> and its Utilisation as a Platform Chemical Feedstock</strong></p>

<p>Led by Ingenza Ltd in partnership with Johnson Matthey Ltd - £443,632.88</p>

<p>An Ingenza and Johnson Matthey collaboration is seeking to develop a novel <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> conversion technology to abate industrial <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> emission and access negative carbon commodity chemical, formate. This collaboration builds on previous successes in feedstock hydrogen and <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> conversion to formate in batch mode operation.</p>

<p>Ingenza is a world leader in Industrial Biotechnology and will implement its capability to develop a bespoke engineered biocatalyst that enables industrial <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> emission to be hydrogenated into formate. Johnson Matthey’s chemical engineering and process flow expertise will enable implementation of the biocatalyst in a cost competitive and scalable operational format for continuous <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> utilisation and formate manufacturing.</p>

<p>The formate product provides a value-added proposition to assimilate industrially emitted <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> into a saleable, versatile commodity chemical which is used across of variety of chemical, pharma, material, agricultural and household product sectors. Existing supply of formate incurs a positive carbon footprint, whereas our drop-in replacement will have a negative-carbon footprint.</p>

<p><strong>FOCUSS - Flexibly-Operated Capture using Solvent Storage</strong></p>

<p>Led by Keadby Generation Ltd in partnership with AECOM Ltd and The University of Sheffield - £515,878.00</p>

<p>High <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> capture levels of 95-99% from carbon capture plants are needed to adequately decarbonise thermal power plants to meet net zero targets. This is even more challenging when the capture system has to be flexible and respond to the electricity system by frequent start-up, shutdown and load ramping as is the case for thermal plants operating with fluctuating renewable electricity generation.</p>

<p>The FOCUSS project’s primary objective is to accelerate the time to market for widely-applicable and cost effective technology to enable post-combustion capture plants to achieve 95-99% <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO₂</abbr> capture levels at all times, including during start-up, shutdown and other transients. The project will develop advanced models to inform a test campaign to be undertaken at the University of Sheffield’s Translational Energy Research Centre Amine Capture Plant, where the novel use of solvent storage will be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Process engineers from AECOM will take these findings to lead the production of a suite of open source industry guidance documents to aid the designers and developers of gas-fired power plants with carbon capture. The project benefits from a cooperation with complementary research work being undertaken by International Test Centre Network colleagues from the National Carbon Capture Centre in the USA.</p>
