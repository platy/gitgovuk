<p>Projects are expected to start from November 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> When are the projects expected to finish?</h3>

<p>Projects can apply for up to 36 months of funding, and <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will consider project durations of longer where justified. But all projects must be complete by 31 March 2025. Please refer to Section 1 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> For Call 1, does the 31 March 2025 deadline mean commissioned, operating, or decommissioned?</h3>

<p>Projects are expected to end on 31 March 2025, with all eligible costs fully defrayed and evidenced before that date. The scope of the project is to be determined by the applicant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span> Is the competition open only to UK based organisations? Can non-UK based organisations lead a project?</h3>

<p>The competition is open to all organisations, independent of where they are based. Projects can work with international partners, but at least 50% of the project funded work must be conducted in the UK. It is preferred that the demonstration of technologies will be at a UK site, but can be at a non-UK site if this can be shown to be reasonably justified.</p>

<p>Non-UK based organisations can lead a project, however, please note if successful we would expect organisations to provide appropriate financial information about their organisation to pass due diligence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> Can I submit more than one application as a lead applicant?</h3>

<p>Lead applicants can submit (and be awarded) more than one application for grant funding in Call 1, but applications must be materially different.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14. </span> Are projects required to be collaborative?</h3>

<p>Individual organisations as well as consortia are welcome to apply for the funding competition, but there is no explicit requirement for collaborative applications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15. </span> Can my organisation apply as part of multiple consortia?</h3>

<p>Consortium member(s) can take part in multiple successful bids. However, if project consortium member(s) are part of multiple successful bids they must be able to deliver on all of them and they must not have applied for funding for the same piece of work more than once. Each individual applicant is limited to £5m total grant funding for this Call.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16. </span> Can universities work with other organisations in applying? Can universities lead an application?</h3>

<p>Yes, academic institutions can submit collaborative applications and they can lead an application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17. </span> Can my organisation apply for both Lot 1 and Lot 2?</h3>

<p>Yes, although applicants will receive no more than £5 million, including if they are delivering multiple projects.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18. </span> Will a delegate list from the Stakeholder Engagement Day be shared so we can contact interested parties to engage in possible consortium establishment discussions?</h3>

<p>A delegate list of those who agreed to have their contact details shared will be shared with all those who submitted an expression of interest by 31 July 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19. </span> Would an existing technology, which is not yet in use in the UK, be in scope for this competition?</h3>

<p>Yes. The technology must meet the <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> conditions as outlined in each of the Lots. For further information on the location of the project, please refer to question 12.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">20. </span> Would a project developing an innovative <abbr title="Carbon Capture Storage">CCS</abbr> approach for blue hydrogen be suitable for this competition, or would it better fit in the Low Carbon Hydrogen Supply 2?</h3>

<p>If the technology being developed meets the criteria of Lot 1 or 2, it would be suitable for this competition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">21. </span> Is <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> shipping or software development in scope?</h3>

<p>The scope of <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0 is innovation in the capture, usage, transport and storage of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>. Any innovation that is unique; meaningfully reduces the cost of deploying <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr>; and/or de-risks the deployment of <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> is within scope of the <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0 programme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22. </span> If a technology is currently in development and receiving funding under an Innovate UK Smart grant, can further funding from <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> be applied for?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will not fund projects that have already been funded privately or through government funding, however funding can be sought for ongoing development on an eligible project.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">23. </span> Does the funding cover <abbr title="capital expenditures">CAPEX</abbr> costs?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">24. </span> Can a <abbr title="Front End Engineering design">FEED</abbr> study be undertaken?</h3>

<p>Front-End Engineering Design (<abbr title="Front End Engineering design">FEED</abbr>) for a full-scale commercial deployment project will not be supported.  All funding requests can include aspects of engineering design up to (and including) pre-<abbr title="Front End Engineering design">FEED</abbr>, meaning any design work and activities on the approved concept in preparation for <abbr title="Front End Engineering design">FEED</abbr>. In essence this programme supports novel <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> innovation through its entire development lifecycle: supporting it to be developed, de-risked, demonstrated and studied at pre-<abbr title="Front End Engineering design">FEED</abbr>.</p>

<p>For projects demonstrating technology in a non-commercial setting, for example at site or in lab conditions, all engineering design work to design, build and operate the demonstration unit is eligible to receive co-funding in <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25. </span> What % of funding is available to Higher Education Institutions?</h3>

<p>For higher education institutions <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will not pay more than 80% of the Full Economic Costs (<abbr title="full economic cost">FEC</abbr>) calculated using the Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) methodology. For other “research organisations” (see definition in Guidance), <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will fund up to 100%. Please refer to Section 5.2 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26. </span> Do we need to send two finance forms since the project will be a collaboration (e.g., between two or more companies, a company and a university, etc.) or should everything be included into one finance form?</h3>

<p>Costs relating to a partner must be incorporated into a single project Finance Form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27. </span> Can you please provide more details on how each proposal will be assessed, i.e. scoring criteria/ranking?</h3>

<p>Please refer to Section 7 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">28. </span> Who will be reviewing &amp; scoring the applications?</h3>

<p>Applications will be assessed by three independent assessors (internal and external to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">29. </span> <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> have also launched the Low Carbon Hydrogen Supply 2, Greenhouse Gas Removals and the Long Duration Energy Storage competitions. Can projects apply to more than one competition?</h3>

<p>Projects are not limited to applying to only one competition. However, they will not be double funded if successful in both.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">30. </span> Is there a single place where all the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> competitions are summarised?</h3>

<p>Find details of all innovation programmes that have been launched as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/net-zero-innovation-portfolio"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Net Zero Innovation Portfolio (<abbr title="Net Zero Innovation Portfolio">NZIP</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Anonymised questions received</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">31. </span> As a recent start-up, are there flexibilities within the Undertaking Distress calculations for successful bidders? We were previously awarded an Innovate UK grant but were unable to receive the award due to the EU State Aid rules.</h3>

<p>Since the UK Exit from the European Union, EU State Aid rules no longer apply to the competition. UK Legislation ‘Subsidy Control’ will be used in this competition. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will operate within the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement (<abbr title="Trade and Co-operation Agreement">TCA</abbr>) requirements and World Trade Organisation (<abbr title="World Trade Organisation">WTO</abbr>) rules, we may decide to offer lower levels of funding than the maximum permitted under the rules; additionally, the funding rules set out in this for <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0 are specific to this Competition only. Please refer to Section 5 of the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">32. </span> As a recent start-up, if we were to partner with another organisation would that effect the Undertaking Distress calculations?</h3>

<p>All successful lead applicants will undergo due diligence prior to entering a grant agreement with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>. Please refer to Section 5 of the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">33. </span> Am I required to include a Heads of Terms agreement? I manage a small company it would be challenging to have this in place before the application deadline.</h3>

<p>Heads of Terms for collaborative projects are only required before a grant offer letter is issued by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to successful bidders. Refer to guidance in Section 5 of the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">34. </span> Can this funding be utilised to support demonstration projects at a scale of 10 <abbr title="tonnes per day">TPD</abbr> which would generate data to design a 100 <abbr title="tonnes per day">TPD</abbr> plant within the same or a subsequent project?</h3>

<p>Yes, this can happen within the same or a subsequent project. The total funding available, i.e. grants applications of greater than £1 million, is contingent on the applicant satisfactorily meeting the eligibility criteria of Lot 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">35. </span> We will be presenting a potential <abbr title="Carbon Capture Usage">CCU</abbr> integrative project within the city scheme of a local authority and I was wondering if this would be considered within the eligibility scope of the competition?</h3>

<p>The project will be considered if the technology falls within the scope of the competition. Similar technology development cannot be funded from 2 grant funding programmes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">36. </span> If my organisation is involved in a project within a large consortium, am I required to declare these stakeholders and technology providers in my bid.</h3>

<p>All collaborative partners and stakeholders involved in the application must be recorded on the application form and additional partner form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">37. </span> Is there a restriction of the type of organisation that can lead a project in this call?</h3>

<p>There are no restrictions to the type of organisation that can make an application. Please refer to Section 5.2 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">38. </span> Is there a maximum percentage of project funding that can be claimed?</h3>

<p>Yes. For Research Organisation please refer to question 25. For Private enterprises please refer to Section 5.2 table 3 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">39. </span> Does the call include funding for capital equipment?</h3>

<p>Yes. Capital equipment will only be funded based on its <abbr title="net present value">NPV</abbr>/deprecation at the end of the project. Please refer to Question 23.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">40. </span> My organisation is looking to scale up 10 tonne per day usage technology, would we be eligible for the competition?</h3>

<p>The scope of <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0 is innovation in the capture, usage, transport and storage of <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>. Lot 1 is for technology with a <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> of ~3-5, at the start of the project. Lot 2 is for technology with a <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> of ~6-8, at the start of the project. When considering applications for grant-funding in Lot 2 (grants of up to £5 million), <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> assessors will have discretion to deem a project to be at a higher or lower maturity than its <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> would suggest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">41. </span> Does the Lot 2 late-stage technology funding have to be used to build and demonstrate a technology at a scale of 100 <abbr title="tonnes per day">TPD</abbr>?</h3>

<p><abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0 is keen to demonstrate as much late-stage <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> technology as possible, ideally demonstrating technology at a scale of 100 <abbr title="tonnes per day">TPD</abbr> or greater. But this is not a requirement. Lot 2 provides co-funding for late-stage <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> technology to meaningfully accelerate the commercialisation of the technology, this doesn’t have to include demonstrating the technology at 100 <abbr title="tonnes per day">TPD</abbr> or greater.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">42. </span> As a <abbr title="higher education institution">HEI</abbr> do we need to submit our application through JeS as well as directly to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>?</h3>

<p>All applications for the <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> 2.0 programme are to be submitted through the smart survey link on the competition landing page on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">43. </span> Is there a way to capture non-funded partners on the applications form?</h3>

<p>All collaborative partners and stakeholders involved in the application must be recorded on the application form and additional partner form. Collaboration partners can include those providing support in-kind.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">44. </span> My technology is not mature enough to apply for Call 1. Would I be eligible to apply for Call 2?</h3>

<p>To apply for grant-funding in Call 1 and Call 2, the underlying <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> technology must be at least a <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> of 3 (Critical Function or Proof of Concept Established) at the beginning of the project, and below a <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> of 9. More information on Call 2 will be published in 2022. Please refer to Question 4.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">45. </span> Could you clarify how the <abbr title="Small and Medium Enterprises">SME</abbr> business definition on p22 applies to a group of companies? Is the definition applied on an individual company basis or a group basis (and what would the definition of a group be)?</h3>

<p>For collaborations containing different sized enterprises or Research Organisations, funding intensity is related to the company receiving the aid. Please refer to Section 5.2 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">46. </span> On grant intensity levels, is that 80% <abbr title="full economic cost">FEC</abbr> so it’s really £800k or is it that the project could be £1.2 million and claim £1 million.</h3>

<p>The maximum grant intensity levels for public funding represent the proportion of project funding <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will support. Applicants can receive up to £1 million in Lot 1 or up to £5 million in Lot 2. For example, an application for £1 million grant at an 80% intensity, would require that the total project cost be at least £1.25 million. Please refer to Section 5.2 table 3 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">47. </span> If the technology proposed is currently at <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> of 3-5 and the grant could take the technology to <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 9. Can the technology be suited for Lot 2 instead of Lot 1? This is relevant to software technologies which have different <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> definitions, and which can go from low <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> to high <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> in a short period of time.</h3>

<p>Applications will have to define what the <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> of their innovation will be at the start of the project. <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> will only be used by assessors as a guide to the maturity of the technology, and will have discretion to deem a project to be at a higher or lower maturity than its <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> would suggest.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">48. </span> Our technology is currently <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 6 for a <abbr title="bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage">BECCS</abbr> application and expect this to increase to <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 8 by 2023. For the purposes of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> 2.0, we consider our technology to be <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 3 in the industry sectors relevant to this call at the beginning of grant program, but we believe we can quickly realise the benefits from parallel programs, potentially raising to <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 8 by 2024. Are we able to submit under [£1m] Lot 1 and / or [£5m] Lot 2?</h3>

<p>See questions 44 and 47. If there are particular aspects of an applicant’s technology that suits an applicant submitting both a Lot 1 and Lot 2 application this is allowed. But both applications must be clear on their interdependencies. If a lead applicant or project consortium member(s) are part of multiple successful bids they must be able to deliver on all of them and they must not have applied for funding for the same piece of work more than once.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">49. </span> We are developing technology from <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 3 to <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> 8 over the duration of this program, do we have to split our programs and submit a Lot 1 in call 1, followed by a Lot 2 in call 2?</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr> at the start of the project is in the range 3-5, this would appear to be a candidate for Lot 1. Projects receiving funding in Call 1 can apply for funding in Call 2. However, applications for Lot 2 in Call 2 will need to demonstrate that the technology is at a late stage of its development by the start of the Call 2 project.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">50. </span> Do proposed host sites need to be fixed at the time of the application?</h3>

<p>Applications should reflect an accurate indication of the project. There is flexibility to move location, but this must be within the scope of the competition call and must be agreed to by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will not be liable for costs incurred because of changing host site location. Please refer to Section 5.2 table 3 in the Call Guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">51. </span> If a grant award sparks market interest, will we be able to expand our program with an additional co-funding partner, and subsequently secure addition <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> funding?</h3>

<p>No. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is unable to provide additional funding post-award. In this example, the applicant would have to apply for funding in Call 2, or a different innovation programme such as a later phase of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Energy Entrepreneurs Fund (EEF).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">52. </span> We understand a limit of £5 million funding is available across all applications. Does this also include where we act as a sub-contractor for the provision of services to applications lead by 3rd parties (i.e. not lead or collaboration members)?</h3>

<p>This requirement only applies to organisations applying for funding on their own or collaboratively as partners. The £5m funding limit does not apply to sub-contractors.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">53. </span> Can I please confirm that undertaking a feasibility study (fulfilling your stated definition) of a potential geological <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> storage site would be within the scope of the <abbr title="Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage">CCUS</abbr> Innovation 2.0 call?</h3>

<p>Yes. Subsurface systems and storage projects would be within the scope of the competition.</p>

<h3>
