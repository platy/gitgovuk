<p>You don’t have to wait until January to file your Self Assessment tax return - here are some quick facts about beating the rush:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can do your tax return early - as soon as the tax year ends, you can submit your tax return at a time that suits you</li>
  <li>filing early has a few benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>some people do so for their peace of mind</li>
      <li>it might help you manage your tax bills or your financial planning for the year by finding out how much you owe, so you can plan your payments</li>
      <li>if you’re owed a refund you’ll get it sooner</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you can file online - the easiest and most secure way to file your tax return is online using your Government Gateway account</li>
  <li>you can get someone to help you - a friend, relative or accountant can complete the return on your behalf</li>
  <li>you don’t have to pay your tax bill at the same time as filing your return, so you have to time to plan how to pay</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s more information below, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what the filing and payment deadlines are for this tax year</li>
  <li>what you need to do if you’ve received furlough payments or have claimed a Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant</li>
  <li>a list of what you need before you start (for example, you need your P60 if you’re employed)</li>
  <li>what to do if you’re worried about your tax bill, and how to pay</li>
  <li>what happens if you’ve paid too much tax</li>
</ul>

<h2>Filing your tax return early</h2>

<p>As soon as the tax year ends, you can complete your tax return at a time that suits you. <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> accepts completed tax returns for the 2021 to 2022 tax year between 6 April 2022 and 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>In fact, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/almost-66500-file-their-self-assessment-on-6-april">almost 65,500 taxpayers submitted their tax returns on 6 April 2022</a>. Some people like completing it early for their peace of mind and it helps them better manage their tax bills.</p>

<h2>Filing online</h2>

<p>The easiest way to complete your tax return is online, via your Government Gateway account. Doing it online is quick and more secure.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return">File your Self Assessment tax return online</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services">setting up a Government Gateway account</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Do not share your Government Gateway user ID and password with anyone else.</p>
</div>

<h3>Filing a paper tax return</h3>

<p>If you can’t complete your tax return online, you can send a paper tax return.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The deadline for submitting your paper tax return is 31 October 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>We do not send out paper tax returns to customers any more but you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets">request a form</a> or contact <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on 0300 200 3310.</p>

<h2>Getting someone to help you with your tax return</h2>

<p>There are several ways you can ask for help with your tax return. You can appoint a relative, friend or an accredited accountant to complete and send your tax return to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you decide this is the best option for you, you will need to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/get-help">how to get help with Self Assessment tax returns</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Even if you authorise someone to act on your behalf, it is still your responsibility to make sure your tax return is correctly completed and submitted on time.</p>

<p>Handing over sensitive personal information, even inadvertently, puts you at risk. Someone using your Government Gateway account could steal from both you and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and leave you having to pay back the full value of any fraudulent repayment claim made on your behalf.</p>

<p>If you appoint a tax agent, they can access the information they need to deal with your tax affairs using <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s agent digital services. Your agent should never need to log in as you, or ask you to share your Government Gateway user ID and password with them.</p>

<h2>If you claimed Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant or received furlough payments</h2>

<p>If you claimed Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grants or received furlough, you’ll need to include details of all the coronavirus support scheme payments you received during the 2021 to 2022 tax year, because they are taxable.</p>

<p>If you are employed and received Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough) payments during the 2021 to 2022 tax year, you will need to enter your earnings and income tax as stated on your P60, which will include any furlough payments you received.</p>

<p>If you are self-employed or in a partnership and received any coronavirus financial support, you will need to declare it on your Self Assessment.</p>

<p>If you are self employed, you should use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-short-sa103s">form SA103S - short</a> if your tax affairs are simple and your turnover was below the VAT threshold for the tax year</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">form SA103F - full</a> if your annual turnover was above the VAT threshold for the tax year</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re in a partnership, you should use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-short-sa104s">form SA104S - short</a> if you’re only declaring partnership trading income</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-full-sa104f">form SA104F - full</a> to record all the possible types of partnership income you might receive</li>
</ul>

<p>There are boxes on these forms to include payments from any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grants (include details of payments received between 6 April 2021 and 5 April 2022 in your 2021 to 2022 tax return - for most customers, this will be the fourth and fifth SEISS grants)</li>
  <li>Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</li>
  <li>Eat Out to Help Out Scheme</li>
  <li>any other applicable <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> coronavirus support scheme</li>
  <li>payments that you were entitled to receive from local authorities or devolved administrations</li>
</ul>

<p>If you incorrectly claimed any coronavirus support scheme payments, you need to report the total amount received on the relevant section of your return (SA100).</p>

<h2>What you need before you start</h2>

<p>There is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns">detailed guidance on GOV.UK to let you know what information you need to complete your tax return</a>.</p>

<h3>Your unique taxpayer reference (<abbr title="unique taxpayer reference">UTR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Before you start to fill in your Self Assessment return, you will need your ten-digit unique taxpayer reference (<abbr title="unique taxpayer reference">UTR</abbr>).</p>

<p>This allows <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to identify you on their systems.</p>

<p>This will be contained on any Self Assessment statements you have received.</p>

<p>If you have your National Insurance number to hand this will help <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> identify your <abbr title="unique taxpayer reference">UTR</abbr>. You can also find it on your Personal Tax Account or the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> app.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Read how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-utr-number">find a lost UTR number</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Your P60</h3>

<p>If you are employed you will have to wait until you receive your P60 so you can accurately complete your tax return.</p>

<h3>Give yourself time, and make sure you’re registered</h3>

<p>Remember to give yourself enough time to do this ahead of the deadline, to allow for your <abbr title="unique taxpayer reference">UTR</abbr> to be posted to you.</p>

<p>If this is your first time completing a tax return, you will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/sending-return">need to register for Self Assessment</a> and then <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will send you your <abbr title="unique taxpayer reference">UTR</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are completing a Self Assessment return because you are self-employed, then you will also need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-for-self-assessment/self-employed">register your self-employment with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Plan ahead</h3>

<p>If you have everything you need to start your tax return, then why not plan ahead?</p>

<p>If you know a particular month is going to be busy for your business, or you are planning to take time off then you can factor this in. Give yourself plenty of time to complete and file your Self Assessment return by starting it early and completing it at a time that suits you.</p>

<h2>The deadlines</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The deadline to file your completed 2021 to 2022 tax return online and pay any tax you owe is 31 January 2023.</p>
</div>

<p>If you submit a paper tax return, you need to send the form to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by 31 October 2022.</p>

<h2>How and when to pay your bill</h2>

<p>You don’t need to pay your Self Assessment tax bill immediately.</p>

<p>The deadline for paying (i) any tax you owe in addition to tax you may have paid through your 2021 to 2022 Payments on Account and (ii) your first 2022 to 2023 Payment on Account is 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>If you file your tax return early, you will know how much you owe and can then choose a payment option that works for you.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill">how to pay your Self Assessment tax bill</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You can now make Self Assessment payments quickly and securely through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-official-hmrc-app"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> app</a>. You can also check if a repayment is due by checking your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account">personal tax account</a>.</p>

<h3>Payments on account</h3>

<p>If you make advance payments towards your tax bill through payments on account, you will probably have paid your first payment on account as it was due on 31 January 2022. Your second payment on account will be due by midnight on 31 July 2022. If you know that your tax bill will be lower for the 2021 to 2022 tax year than for the previous tax year, perhaps due to loss of earnings due to COVID-19, then you can still make a claim to reduce your July 2022 payment on account online.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-account">Understand your Self Assessment tax bill - payments on account</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>It is important to remember that if you lower your payments on account by too much, you may be subject to interest charges on the difference. Any outstanding balance owing after you have paid your payments on account, will be calculated once you have submitted your 2021 to 2022 tax return.</p>

<h2>If you’re worried about your tax bill</h2>

<p>If you are worried about how to pay your bill or whether you can afford to pay it, we can help.</p>

<p>We want to work with you to find an affordable way for you to pay the tax you owe, for example paying what you owe in instalments.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>Budgeting to pay your tax bill</h2>

<p>You can use our Budget payment plan service to make regular weekly or monthly payments towards your next tax bill. You must be up to date with your previous Self Assessment payments and you can decide how much to pay each week or month.</p>

<p>Set up your plan using your <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> online account. Go to the Direct Debit section and choose the ‘set up a budget payment plan’ option when filling in the Direct Debit form. If the amount in your budget payment plan does not cover your next bill in full, you will need to pay the difference by the payment deadline deadlines. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/pay-weekly-monthly">paying weekly or monthly</a>.</p>

<p>A budget payment plan is different from payments on account, which you normally make in January and July.</p>

</div>

<h3>If you can’t pay in full by 31 January 2023</h3>

<p>If you already know that you will not be able to pay in full by 31 January 2022, you can set up a payment plan online without speaking to anyone by using the self-serve Time to Pay facility, provided you meet criteria to use this service.</p>

<p>Find out what to do <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/difficulties-paying-hmrc">if you cannot pay your tax bill on time</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you have an outstanding amount after the payment due date, interest will accrue on that amount until it is paid in full, even if you are in a payment plan.</p>

<p>Self-serve Time to Pay allows you to choose the length of the agreement and works out the monthly payments. We recommend you repay any debt as quickly as possible, while making sure the payments are affordable.</p>

<h2>If you’ve paid too much tax</h2>

<p>If you have overpaid tax during the 2021 to 2022 tax year (for example if you have already paid what tax you owed for the year via you payments on account), we will let you know how much you have overpaid when you file your Self Assessment tax return, and we will send you a refund.</p>
