<p>The United Kingdom is honoured to present its candidature for the International Telecommunication Union (<abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>) Council. The UK’s election to the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council will help to support strong leadership in the organisation at a time of rapid technological change. The UK is committed to information and communications technology (<abbr title="Information and communications technology">ICT</abbr>) innovation, the use of ICTs to address global challenges, and the importance of collaboration and consensus building to find solutions. We have long been involved in and supported a central role for the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> in the radiocommunications sector, in developing technical standards and in supporting sustainable development through digital connectivity.</p>

<h2>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>We are pleased to introduce the UK’s 2022 <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council Election manifesto. The <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> has a vital role to play in making sure that every country shares in the benefits of the digital revolution. The UK has a lot to bring to the table in this effort.</p>

<p>We are proud of the UK’s thriving, innovative tech sector and leading academic institutions and our 22 <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> sector members which allow us to contribute our expertise in science and technology across the three sectors of the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>. We believe in multilateralism and are committed to seeking shared solutions for global issues, as we have demonstrated with the UK’s Presidencies of both the G7 and the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in 2021.</p>

<p>As a Council member we would have three key aims. First, we would promote a collaborative <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> which fosters international cooperation, consensus-building and sharing of best practices.</p>

<p>Second, we would help the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> to work effectively for all its members, including by increasing worldwide connectivity and bridging the digital divide. We are already showing our commitment here through the UK’s Digital Access Programme, which is working to promote inclusive digital connectivity across five countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>

<p>Third, we would support the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> to be respected in the multilateral system as a well-run organisation that delivers its vital mission of championing development issues, developing high quality technical standards and efficiently allocating radio spectrum.</p>

<p>By supporting the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> to play its full role at this crucial moment, we would take a big step together towards realising the ambitious goals of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a Council member, we would work with all <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> members to that end and strengthen the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> to deliver on its exciting and important agenda. <br><br><br></p>

<p>The Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss MP<br>
<strong>Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs</strong></p>

<p>The Rt Hon Nadine Dorries MP<br>
<strong>Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</strong></p>

<h2>Why are we standing for the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>’s mission to ‘connect the world’ has never been more important. Information and communication technology is essential to every aspect of modern life and the development of the digital economy.</p>

<p>The UK strongly supports the international leadership role played by the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>; coordinating radio spectrum, developing technical standards and helping to bridge the digital divide. We are standing for election to the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council to help promote and strengthen:</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>a collaborative ITU</strong>, which provides a platform for international cooperation and consensus, working with other organisations and stakeholder groups, and sharing best practice and fostering partnerships</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>an effective ITU</strong>, which champions development issues and provides a compelling global voice for the importance of telecommunications/ICTs to sustainable development</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>a respected ITU</strong>, which is well-managed and delivers for all its members, valued for its expertise, transparency and inclusive participation</p>
</div>

<h2>Why should you support a UK seat on the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council?</h2>

<p>The UK has been a committed member of the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> for 150 years, bringing together our rich ecosystem of industry, government and academia to provide technical expertise and unlock the benefits of technical standards for citizens and societies.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> remains an integral platform for governments and other stakeholders to come together and collaborate on a set of common challenges, specifically on its core responsibilities focused on radio communication, telecommunications standards and support for developing countries.</p>

<p>The UK has been championing transparency and accountability in the business of the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> and its commitments and remit as a specialised agency of the UN. We value the openness of the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> and the many contributions of its varied members and member states in particular.</p>

<p>We remain deeply committed to multilateralism, and prize our membership of many global bodies. Our Presidencies of the G7 and COP26 have demonstrated the UK’s pursuit of a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced set of outcomes; importantly, ensuring no person is left behind. The UK’s candidature for the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council is an important part of this objective.</p>

<p>Working with our international partners, we will protect and promote universal values, recognising that the way in which technical standards are developed and deployed has a real-world impact on citizens and societies.</p>

<p>We will continue to work towards realising the value of global standards development. We recognise the significant and positive role that technical standards have played in supporting the global economy and societies.</p>

<p>We also see the pivotal role <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>-R is playing in the dramatic changes underway in the communications sector. From supporting 5G for consumers and businesses, to enabling profound changes in technologies such as satellite communications that can support global connectivity, the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>’s influence in radio communications has never been more crucial.</p>

<p>Nevermore than in the last two years has technology, and telecommunications in particular, been such an integral part of our lives. At the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Council, the UK will bring together our prestigious academia with our world-renowned industry to help forge the way ahead, and continue to unlock and promote the benefits of innovation in telecommunications for societies and citizens.</p>

<h2>Committed to the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We are proud to have supported Deputy Secretary-General Malcolm Johnson in successive leadership positions within the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>. Over many years he has made a significant contribution to the work of the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>, its membership and its staff. He has driven inclusion, a strong development focus and good governance. As a Council member, the United Kingdom will continue to assert those values within the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>.</p>

<p>We are active in all sectors of the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>. We chair <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>-T Study Group 2 (Numbering, Naming and Addressing) and the Focus Group on AI for Autonomous and Assisted Driving. We chair <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>-R Study Group 5 (Terrestrial Services) and are a vice-chair of Group3 (Radiowave propagation) and Group 7 (Science Services). We are also vice-chair of two Council Working Groups (Internet and Strategic and Financial Plan). And we are active in the CEPT region, having been vice-chair of CEPT’s Committee on <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> Policy since 2015.</p>

<p>We enthusiastically engage in a variety of study groups across the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>-
Telecommunication Standardization Sector, Development and Radiocommunication sectors and work with our international colleagues to realise the value of global standards development and information sharing within this unique organisation.</p>

<h2>Supporting sustainable development</h2>

<p>The UK shares the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>’s ambition of closing the global digital gap, and for this reason the FCDO Digital Access Programme (<abbr title="Digital Access Programme">DAP</abbr>) team has recently co-designed an exciting collaboration with the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>, to leverage each other’s expertise and ongoing digital inclusion initiatives. The <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>-FCDO partnership project in five <abbr title="Digital Access Programme">DAP</abbr> countries is focused on the provision of technical assistance and capacity strengthening in four key areas, building on ongoing work and recent results from the <abbr title="Digital Access Programme">DAP</abbr> and also leveraging key <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> initiatives (Giga, Decent Jobs for Youth, and Digital Skills for Africa):</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting telecom regulators to enhance regulatory frameworks that enable digital inclusion</li>
  <li>promoting a more conducive environment for public and private investment in digital inclusion</li>
  <li>developing sustainable and inclusive technology and business models to expand school connectivity in underserved communities</li>
  <li>advancing digital skills as a means to decent jobs for young people</li>
</ul>

<p>Our cyber-security capacity building programme has worked with over 100 partner countries and helped train over 70 Cyber Security Incident Response Teams.</p>

<p>The UK Space Agency’s £150-million International Partnership Programme utilises the UK’s capabilities in satellite technology and data services to partner with developing countries to deliver sustainable development. Since 2016 it has grant-funded 43 projects in 47 countries.</p>

<h2>Promoting innovation and partnership</h2>

<p>We founded the ground-breaking WE Protect global alliance to promote child online protection, making a major contribution to the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>’s revised Child Online Protection Guidelines.</p>

<p>We are a strong supporter of an <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr> that serves all nations. We have a track record of working with our fellow Commonwealth nations, including through the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (<abbr title="Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation">CTO</abbr>). We will continue to work with Commonwealth partners to share information and insights on global <abbr title="Information and communications technology">ICT</abbr> developments.</p>

<p>We are committed to working closely with industry and innovators to deliver the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>’s objectives. UK Sector Members make an active contribution to the <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union">ITU</abbr>, including ARM, Avanti, the BBC, British Telecom, Inmarsat and Vodafone. In total we have over 50 Sector Members, Associates and Academia members.</p>
