<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Council Tax rebate schemes</h2>

<p>1. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities recently released <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-council-tax-rebate-2022-23-billing-authority-guidance">The council tax rebate 2022-23 – billing authority guidance</a> for English local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) in relation to the £150 Council Tax rebate and related discretionary fund.</p>

<p>2. Devolved governments have introduced similar schemes as below.</p>

<p>3. This article provides <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with further information on data sharing and the Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) and Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) disregard to enable <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to administer the rebate.</p>

<h3>England</h3>

<p>4. In England, funding is being given to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to give all households whose primary residence is valued in council tax bands A to D, as a one-off Council Tax energy rebate payment of £150.</p>

<p>5. The government will also provide funding for billing authorities to operate a discretionary fund for households in need who would not otherwise be eligible. This could include for example individuals on low incomes who live in properties valued in bands E to H.</p>

<h3>Scotland</h3>

<p>6. In Scotland, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will provide a £150 credit to households who meet the eligibility criteria to support households with rising energy prices. There will also be a small discretionary scheme to pay grants to households exempt from Council Tax.</p>

<p>7. Eligible households will be those:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in receipt of Council Tax Reduction on a particular date</li>
  <li>in a Band A to D property</li>
  <li>certain households exempt from Council Tax</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wales</h3>

<p>8. In Wales, a £150 cost of living payment will be provided to all households in properties in council tax bands A to D and to all households who receive help to pay their Council Tax from the Local Council Tax Reduction Scheme. There is also a discretionary scheme which will provide additional funds for households who are struggling.</p>

<h3>Effect of payments on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>9. All 3 schemes meet the definition of ‘local welfare provision’ in the Housing Benefit regulations and can be disregarded.</p>

<h3>Effect of payments on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>10. The government has legislated to ensure that payments made under the Energy Rebate scheme announced on 3 February 2022 and equivalent schemes in the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, do not affect entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>11. From 1 April 2022, these regulations will ensure that people on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> will not experience a reduction or withdrawal of that benefit simply because they receive a payment under the Energy Rebate scheme. This disregard also applies to payments made under a comparable scheme announced by the Scottish and Welsh governments.</p>

<h3>Sharing of the Department for Work and Pensions’ data to support <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> administration</h3>

<p>12. The Council Tax rebate will be classed as local welfare provision. This permits <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to utilise Searchlight for verification purposes in order to administer discretionary funds.</p>

<p>13. For Scottish <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, there is a small discretionary fund for households exempt from Council Tax and, therefore, no access to the Department for Work and Pensions’ (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s) data is needed or permitted.</p>

<p>14. Given the short-term nature of this funding, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is not creating a bespoke user role on Searchlight for this work. Existing user roles available on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Employee Authentication Service - Replacement (<abbr title="Employee Authentication Service - Replacement">EAS-R</abbr>) can be used.</p>

<p>15. If <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> wish to add additional users to <abbr title="Employee Authentication Service - Replacement">EAS-R</abbr> to help administer the rebate, do be aware all 4 Baseline Personnel Security Standard (<abbr title="Baseline Personnel Security Standard">BPSS</abbr>) checks, as mandated by the Cabinet Office, must be completed. As <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be aware this takes time, therefore, it is <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s expectation that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will primarily seek to utilise existing staff access to Searchlight rather than adding new users.</p>

<p>16. If you have any questions surrounding the content of this article email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.correspondence@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.correspondence@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Changes to the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</h2>

<p>17. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be aware that there have been changes to the Test and Trace Support Payment (<abbr title="Test and Trace Support Payment">TTSP</abbr>) scheme, predominately in England and Wales.</p>

<p>18. As a result, many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have asked for clarity on access to Searchlight in order to administer the scheme. The changes will impact as follows:</p>

<h3>England</h3>

<p>19. The <abbr title="Test and Trace Support Payment">TTSP</abbr> scheme ended in England on 24 February 2022 and all applications must be processed by 30 April 2022.</p>

<p>20. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in England can continue to access Searchlight until 30 April 2022, after which permission to use the service for the scheme will be revoked.</p>

<p>21. From 1 May 2022, the Searchlight user role ‘SG_Get_Income_Information_Addon’ will be automatically removed from users and the data will no longer be available.</p>

<h3>Wales</h3>

<p>22. The Self-isolation Support Scheme in Wales will continue until the end of June 2022. It is anticipated there will be a requirement for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in Wales to continue processing applications beyond this date.</p>

<p>23. More details on when the Searchlight user role will be removed for Welsh <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be communicated nearer the time.</p>

<h3>Scotland</h3>

<p>24. Support for people self-isolating will continue in Scotland, this includes the Self-Isolation Support Grant.</p>

<p>25. Scottish <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can continue to access Searchlight until further notice.</p>

<p>26. Note, returns to HM Revenue and Customs required under their data-gathering powers and Schedule 23 notices must still be provided as per the existing monthly schedule. This is to ensure any necessary tax adjustments are made for those individuals who received these payments.</p>
