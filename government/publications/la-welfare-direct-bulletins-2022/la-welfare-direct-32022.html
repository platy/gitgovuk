<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Revisions</h2>

<p>We apologise for any inconvenience caused but this bulletin is being reissued as it has been revised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit reassessment corrective exercise article paragraphs 7-18 have been updated following a change in information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>When I last wrote this editorial in September 2021, I mentioned the uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and the Spending Review and how difficult it was to predict the next 6 months, let alone the next 5 years. Six months already feels a lifetime ago. Since then, we’ve had a petrol shortage, the disruption of the COVID-19 Omicron wave, an energy price crisis, rising inflation and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Clearly, we live in uncertain times. So, all we can do is keep on communicating what we know to local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) as soon as we can. We know it’s appreciated from the feedback we receive but do tell us if we can do even better.</p>

<p>On the subject of feedback, in November last year, my team sent the first of what will be an ongoing customer feedback survey primarily focused on data sharing and data security to 25% of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. Every quarter 25% of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will receive the survey so each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> will receive it once a year.</p>

<p>The survey results from the first 25% were a very interesting read and, in the main, really positive. In particular, the ‘free text’ feedback was especially useful, giving significant insight into what we can do next to further support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> through data sharing and automation improvements.</p>

<p>We’ve already sent early summary results to those that were surveyed. We now intend to contact some of those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> directly to answer some of the questions asked or to seek more detailed insight into problems or suggestions raised.</p>

<p>The second quarter of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have been issued with their surveys on 16 February 2022 with the final <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> receiving their surveys in 3 and 6 months’ time. When you do receive the survey, please take the time to fill it in. It should only take between 15 and 30 minutes depending on how much free text you write. I can assure you that every response is read in detail and will be used to shape our future direction.</p>

<h3>All <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> conference call 10 March 2022</h3>

<p>4. The next <abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative all <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> conference call will take place on Thursday 10 March 2022 from 11am to 12 noon.

<h2>Employment and Support Allowance Underpayment/Incapacity Benefit reassessment corrective exercise</h2>

<p>7.	The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) began migrating Incapacity Benefit (<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>)/Severe Disability Allowance/Income Support (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>) cases to Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) from 2011 onwards.</p>

<p>8.	Entitlement to <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Income Related (<abbr title="Income Related">IR</abbr>) was not initially considered if ‘<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>’ was not in payment at the point of migration.</p>

<p>9.	This led to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Underpayment Legal Entitlement and Administrative Practices (<abbr title="Legal Entitlements and Administrative Practices">LEAP</abbr>) corrective exercise which completed on 1 June 2021. We have reviewed around 600,000 cases (see note below) and made 118,000 arrears payments to those who were eligible, totalling £613 million. The final statistical update published on 8 July 2021 and can be found here.</p>

<p>10.	We originally presented details of the corrective exercise and its potential impact on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> to the Practitioners’ Operational Group (<abbr title="Practitioners’ Operational Group">POG</abbr>) on 20 February 2020, but further action was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are now able to share details of the impact on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.</p>

<p>Note, the numbers of cases that have started the reassessment journey or have been contacted and the number of cases completed and qualifying for arrears payments are rounded to the nearest 1,000; the total amount of historical arrears paid is rounded to the nearest £1 million.</p>

<h3>Impact on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>11.	If the cases affected by the <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Underpayment corrective exercise had been correctly awarded <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> (<abbr title="Income Related">IR</abbr>) and the claimant had also been claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, they would have been entitled to passported <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> at the maximum rate.</p>

<p>12.	Many claimants affected by the exercise, who were also claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> were already on the maximum rate of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, but some were not.</p>

<p>13.	We are now looking to provide <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with the information they need to consider whether any arrears are due to the claimants that were not on the maximum rate of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.</p>

<p>14.	As part of the exercise, the ongoing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> awards were updated at the point the <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> award was corrected. Arrears of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> were not considered at this stage. This is now what we are asking <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to consider.</p>

<h3>The process</h3>

<p>15.	We have identified 22,500 cases that were not receiving the maximum rate of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> by matching <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data between 2011 and 2019 with <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Underpayment corrective exercise management information. These are the cases we want <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to look at to see if they should be on maximum <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>.</p>

<p>16.	We plan to issue a spreadsheet of cases via Transfer Your File (<abbr title="Transfer Your File">TYF</abbr>) week commencing 14 March 2022 for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to check if arrears of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> are due.</p>

<p>17.	We will provide claimant details and the period of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> arrears already paid for the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to consider if <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> arrears are due for the same period.</p>

<p>18.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are requested to record the period and value of any arrears payment and the date the case was cleared before returning the spreadsheet to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.laliaisonteam@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.laliaisonteam@dwp.gov.uk</a> by 30 June 2022 at the latest.</p>

<h3>New Burdens funding</h3>

<p>19. Following consultation with <abbr title="Practitioners’ Operational Group">POG</abbr>, funding has been agreed to cover the New Burden to re-assess these cases.</p>

<p>20. Funding will be allocated according to the volume of cases each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has to reassess. Details of allocations will be issued in a Subsidy circular and funding will be issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> week commencing 28 March 2022.</p>

<p>21. If you have any questions about this exercise, please email the address above.</p>

<h2>Changes to the European Union Settlement Scheme ‘share code’ process</h2>

<p>22. Changes have been made to the ‘share codes’ that are generated by individuals for proving their immigration status. When applying to the European Union Settlement Scheme, individuals must now select one of the following 3 reasons for sharing their immigration status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to prove their right to rent</li>
  <li>to prove their right to work</li>
  <li>for another reason</li>
</ul>

<p>23. Once selected this will generate a 9-character long share code that can be passed on to a third party such as an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. This can be used to check the individual’s rights online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status">View and prove your immigration status service</a>.</p>

<p>24. All newly generated share codes will begin with a letter denoting the purpose the ‘share code’ can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R - generated by an individual to evidence their ‘right to rent’.</li>
  <li>W - generated by an individual to evidence their ‘right to work’</li>
  <li>S - this indicates a ‘something else’ share code has been generated to evidence their immigration status for another purpose, for example a driving licence application or to open a bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>25. Apart from this change to the first character of all share codes, they will continue to work in the same way and will always be 9 characters long.</p>

<p>26. The share codes can only be used for the purpose that it was originally selected, for example, a share code generated to prove an individual’s right to rent can only be used in the ‘View someone’s Right to Rent’ online checking service.</p>

<p>27. All share codes generated prior to 17 February 2022 will still only be valid for a period of 30 days.</p>

<p>28. Share codes generated from 17 February 2022 and all newly generated codes across all services will be valid for 90 days.</p>

<h2>Update: ‘Help to Claim’ Universal Credit support</h2>

<p>29. As notified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2022/la-welfare-direct-22022">LAWD2/2022</a>, from 1 April 2022 Citizens Advice (in partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland) will continue to provide independent ‘Help to Claim’ support to people wanting to make a new claim to Universal Credit. This support will cover <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/helptoclaim/?utm_source=https%3a%2f%2fnews.dwp.gov.uk%2fdwplz%2f&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Touchbase+-+28+January+2022&amp;utm_term=Touchbase+-+28+January+2022&amp;utm_content=88356" rel="external">England, Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cas.org.uk/helptoclaim?utm_source=https%3a%2f%2fnews.dwp.gov.uk%2fdwplz%2f&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Touchbase+-+28+January+2022&amp;utm_term=Touchbase+-+28+January+2022&amp;utm_content=88356" rel="external">Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>30. Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland will provide Help to Claim support by telephone and digital channels. They will refer people unable to access support through these channels to their local jobcentre, where staff will identify the appropriate support to meet their needs.</p>

<h2>
