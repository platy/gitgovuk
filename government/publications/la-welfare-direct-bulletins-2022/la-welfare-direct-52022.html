<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>It is a pleasure for me to put pen to paper (as they used to say!) for this edition of the Local Authority Welfare Direct. May already, so let’s hope for some warm Great British sun soon and, most definitely, for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee! I hope your plans for celebrating this historic event are well advanced.</p>

<p>So, what do we have for you in this month’s edition? As ever, there is a mixed bundle of information for us to communicate and cascade. Here is a flavour. We are signalling our intentions to migrate Searchlight and Verify Earnings and Pensions Service off the Public Service Network to a new solution. This won’t be until April 2023 but key for us is to move to any new solution as seamlessly as we can.  I would, therefore, urge you to keep this in view. What would we do without Searchlight and the Verify Earnings and Pensions Service?</p>

<p>There is a gentle reminder about Housing Benefit Debt Recoveries returns for you to consider. By way of a nudge from me, please feel free to contact my Performance Development Team (<abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr>) if you want help with any aspect of your <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> administration; not least anything to do with debt. We are here to support you and can help you to significantly increase your levels of debt recovery. If you are interested, please get in touch at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.pdt@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.pdt@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>One final thing to flag - I consider <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr> to be in a rather privileged position to support local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>). Not least because of the rich knowledge and experience our five <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> secondees bring to the Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery division. Appreciating <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> colleagues continue to face unique resource and other pressures; it would be great to hear from anyone who relishes a challenge and wants to develop. Working for our division on secondment is a great development opportunity so, if you fancy it, do read the related article in full and get in touch.</p>

<p>I think that is it for now, so thanks for reading, enjoy the summer and stay safe.</p>

<p>Jonathan Bottomer 
Head of <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr></p>

<h2>New Housing Benefit Matching Service Employment and Support Allowance address rule</h2>

<p>1.	The Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division is continually improving the suite of Housing Benefit Matching Service (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>) rules to provide quality referrals and to reduce nugatory referrals issued to local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>).</p>

<p>2.	<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> has introduced a new <abbr title="Housing Benefit Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> rule HBES055.</p>

<p>3.	This rule identifies <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants who are in receipt of Employment and Support Allowance and failed to notify the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> of a change of address.</p>

<p>4.	The new referrals will be available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> from week commencing 9 May 2022. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> rules guidance (which is available on Glasscubes) will be updated to reflect the new rule.</p>

<p>5.	If you have any questions regarding the content of this article contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Update: Public Services Network</h2>

<p>6.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be aware that two Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) IT applications (Searchlight and Verify Earnings and Pension Service) are still hosted on the Public Service Network (<abbr title="Public Service Network">PSN</abbr>). <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Digital colleagues are currently developing the solutions to migrate these two services off <abbr title="Public Service Network">PSN</abbr> by April 2023.</p>

<p>7.	There is still a significant amount of work to do in this area. Therefore, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is working with Cabinet Office on potential contingency options for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should there be any delays. We will be providing regular communications over the coming months to keep <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> updated on progress and to help with their planning.</p>

<p>8.	In the meantime, if you have any questions, contact:    <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lasupport@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lasupport@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Reminder: <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Debt Recoveries returns for national statistics</h2>

<p>9.	The <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Debt Recoveries (<abbr title="HB Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr>) national statistics are published twice a year in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>March</strong> (for the period April to September which covers quarter 1 (Q1) and Q2 of the previous year), and</li>
  <li>
<strong>September</strong> (for the period April to March which covers Q3 and Q4 of the previous year).</li>
</ul>

<p>10.	These are supported by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who are asked to complete and return their <abbr title="HB Debt Recoveries">HBDR</abbr> template on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p>11.	The statistics show the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt identified and recovered during specific times of the financial year. The publication of this information offers a level of transparency to the public and interested parties alike, whilst helping to inform future policy across <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> which, in turn, identifies new ways to help <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> prevent and recover overpayments in the future.</p>

<p>12.	Each individual <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> return is important as it enables <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statisticians to present an overall picture of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayments and recoveries across Great Britain.</p>

<p>13.	Over the last quarter some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have either not provided a return or have been late in providing their return. This prevents <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s ability to monitor the effectiveness of the support that we provide to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and to provide accurate and robust statistics.</p>

<h3>Current position</h3>

<p>14.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-benefit-recoveries-and-fraud-data">latest <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Debt Recoveries statistics</a> on the 2 March 2022. They showed the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt identified and recovered during the first two quarters of the last financial year.</p>

<p>15.	In recent years, the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> overpayment identified and recovered by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> has steadily fallen, in line with the fall in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload. However, the latest figures show that the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt identified by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> between April and September 2021 was £17 million (9%) higher than the same period the previous year.</p>

<p>16.	The amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt recovered was higher too, by £12 million (6%). This reflects the increased <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt recovery activity during April to September 2021, compared with the same period the previous year, when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit.</p>

<h3>Action for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>17.	We strongly encourage all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to work with the department’s Data Delivery Team to return data by the agreed deadlines to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:hbdr@dwp.gov.uk">hbdr@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>18.	If you have any problems returning the data, contact the Data Delivery Team on the email address given above.</p>

<h2>Reminder: Mixed Age Couple claims for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or Pension Credit</h2>

<p>19.	We are aware that there is still some confusion about when a new claim for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or Pension Credit can be made by a Mixed Age Couple.</p>

<p>20.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-benefits-for-mixed-age-couples">Mixed Age Couple policy</a> came into force from 15 May 2019 for all new claims from couples where one member is over State Pension age and the other member is under State Pension age.</p>

<p>21.	Guidance about the changes to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> regulations and which couples could apply for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and/or Pension Credit was issued through circulars <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-benefit-adjudication-circulars-2019/a32018-mixed-age-couples-changes-to-entitlement-conditions-from-15-may-2019"><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A3/2019</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-benefit-adjudication-circulars-2019/a92019-mixed-age-couples-further-guidance"><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> A9/2019</a></p>

<p>22.	The following paragraphs are a reminder of the information provided in A9/2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Although the majority of Mixed Age Couples are unable to make new claims for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> assessed under the Housing Benefit (persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/214), this doesn’t apply where the couple have an existing claim for Pension Credit.</li>
  <li>A Mixed Age Couple may also make a new claim for Pension Credit where there is an existing claim for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> assessed under the Housing Benefit (persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/214).</li>
</ul>

<p>23.	If you have any questions about the content of this article email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:housing.policyenquiries@dwp.gov.uk">housing.policyenquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Single service phone line for bereaved citizens</h2>

<p>24.	From 11 April 2022, the new single contact number for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWPs</abbr> bereavement services is 0800 151 2012.</p>

<p>25.	This number is for citizens to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>report a death, provide information and find out what support is available following a bereavement</li>
  <li>make a new or, manage an existing claim for Bereavement Benefit or Bereavement Support Payment</li>
  <li>make a new or, manage an existing claim for Funeral Expenses Payments</li>
  <li>request State Pension updates following the death of a spouse or civil partner</li>
</ul>

<p>26.	The new number will be publicised through appropriate communications channels, including www.gov.uk and the updating of customer letters and leaflets.</p>

<h2>Future strategy for providing support for people to claim Universal Credit – Supplier event</h2>

<p>27.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> currently provides grant funding to support people to make and maintain their Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) claim up until their first correct <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> payment.</p>

<p>28.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is looking at how best to fulfil these requirements in the future by considering our strategy and the capability of the marketplace.</p>

<p>29.	The requirements have not yet been finalised and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is hosting an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/providing-support-for-people-to-claim-universal-credit-supplier-event">industry pre-market engagement event</a> on Thursday 19 May 2022 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give potential delivery partners the opportunity to better understand <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s objectives and challenges, and</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain insight from the market about potential ways forward.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strategy to completing the Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>30.	As <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may have seen, on 25 April 2022 <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> published the strategy to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/completing-the-move-to-universal-credit">completing the Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr></a></p>

<h2>Secondment opportunities in <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> division</h2>

<p>31.	Working with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, as one of our major stakeholders in Welfare Reform, continues to feature heavily and for this reason we value the expertise and knowledge that <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> experts can bring to the team. These secondment opportunities provide an opportunity to gain an insight and experience of policy development and workings of central government.</p>

<p>32.	<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> has had a programme of bringing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> experts from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in to work alongside data sharing, subsidy, change and performance teams on secondment.

<p>36.	This is an exciting opportunity to play a leading role in maintaining and improving stakeholder relationships between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and in designing innovative opportunities for closer working during this busy and complex period of welfare reform.</p>

<h3>Personal requirements</h3>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>38.	Secondment posts would be offered for either 12 months or 24 months dependant on the role offered across the division.
