<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Update: Housing Benefit Matching Service Jobseekers Allowance address rule</h2>

<p>1. The Local Authority Partnership Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division is continually improving the suite of Housing Benefit Matching Service (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>) rules to provide quality referrals and to reduce nugatory referrals issued to local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>).</p>

<p>2. Over the last 12 months <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> has worked closely with several <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to identify both issues and improvements to rule HBJS055.</p>

<p>3. This rule identifies <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants who are in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and have failed to notify the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> of a change of address.</p>

<p>4. Investigations have revealed that some referrals were being made where the address identified for Jobseekers Allowance was no longer the claimant’s current address and the claimant’s address held by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> was in fact the correct one. Amendments have been made to exclude these nugatory referrals.</p>

<p>5. The enhanced referrals will be available to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> from the week commencing 18 April 2022 and referrals should now only include current addresses held on the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Jobseekers Allowance Payments system.</p>

<p>6. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> rules guidance (which can be found on Glasscubes) will be updated to reflect the amendments and <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> would like to take this opportunity to thank those <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who participated in the consultation process.</p>

<p>7. If you have any questions regarding the content of this article, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>
