<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Welcome to the June edition of the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Direct; the year is certainly flying by. I hope you all enjoyed the extended holiday and Jubilee celebrations last week.</p>

<p>The Speed of Processing statistics were published on Wednesday 27 April 2022. The numbers are marginally higher than for the same period last year as you will see in the related article but we know <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> continue to be under a lot of pressure and your efforts in maintaining high levels of service are recognised.</p>

<p>You will all be aware the managed move of claimants to Universal Credit has resumed and more information and useful links can also be found within. We will continue to keep you updated on progress.</p>

<p>You will also find an invitation to the next Data sharing and IT consultation and engagement forum. I encourage anyone who has an interest in this area to join the call to hear the latest developments, ask questions and share issues. These events are well attended and I know the team find your input invaluable.</p>

<p>I hoped you enjoyed the article in the June edition of the Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation’s Insight magazine looking at a day in the life of our <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Analytical Team. It certainly is an extremely busy team and one area we are currently focusing on is the Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) Award Accuracy Initiative management information. We are still finding quite a few anomalies and blanks in the data and my team are providing data and analysis to support the Performance Development Team’s discussions with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Funding Team is also starting to look at arrangements for the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy workshops for the next financial year. Thank you to all those who attended previous workshops. Feedback is always positive and we aim to build on this by reviewing how we deliver future workshops and best utilise technology.</p>

<p>Take care everyone</p>

<p>Tracy Williams
Head of Local Authority Funding, Analysis and Business Support</p>

<h2>Unpaid carer financial support scheme (Wales only)</h2>

<p>1.	The Welsh Government has announced a new scheme to help eligible unpaid carers by offering a one-off payment of £500. Eligibility for the scheme is for unpaid carers in receipt of Carer’s Allowance on 31 March 2022 or who are awarded Carer’s Allowance at a later date which is backdated to 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>2.	People who have an underlying entitlement to Carer’s Allowance but who are not receiving it are not eligible for the payment.</p>

<p>3.	More information about the scheme including information on how to register for the payment is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.wales/" rel="external">www.gov.wales</a></p>

<p>4.	Registrations for the payment opened on 16 May 2022 and will close on 15 July 2022. All payments should be processed by 30 September 2022.</p>

<h2>Impact on Housing Benefit</h2>

<p>5.	As these payments are being made by local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) they are designated as being payments of local welfare provision and, as such, are disregarded for Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) purposes.</p>

<p>6.	These payments will also be disregarded for Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) purposes.</p>

<h2>New <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> guidance for supported housing claims</h2>

<p>7.	The new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-benefit-guidance-for-supported-housing-claims">Housing Benefit guidance for supported housing claims</a> has been published on www.gov.uk. A copy of the guidance was also issued directly to all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ Revenues and Benefits Managers on Friday 6 May 2022.</p>

<p>8.	We hope that the guidance will assist <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with assessing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims for those living in supported housing and would like to take this opportunity to thank those of you who provided input and comments while we were developing the guidance.</p>

<p>9.	The plan is to review the guidance on a regular basis but, to ensure there are no issues with the current content, we intend to carry out an initial review after six months.</p>

<p>10.	In the meantime, any questions can be emailed to:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:housing.policyenquiries@dwp.gov.uk">housing.policyenquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Updated Discretionary Housing Payments guidance manual</h2>

<p>11.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/discretionary-housing-payments-guidance-manual">Discretionary Housing Payments guidance manual</a>, which provides guidance and advice on good practices when payment of a Discretionary Housing Payment is being considered, has been updated on our <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> pages on www.gov.uk.</p>

<p>12.	We carry out a review of the guidance manual each year in consultation with the Practitioners’ Operations Group (<abbr title="Practitioners’ Operations Group">POG</abbr>). Do note, this latest version has been significantly condensed, which we hope <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will find more user friendly.</p>

<h2>Cost of Living Payment</h2>

<p>13.	On 26 May 2022, the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) published guidance regarding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payment">getting an extra payment to help with the cost of living</a> for those entitled to certain benefits or tax credits. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/millions-of-most-vulnerable-households-will-receive-1200-of-help-with-cost-of-living">announcement</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cost-of-living-support">Statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-living-support/cost-of-living-support-factsheet-26-may-2022">Cost of living support factsheet</a> on this matter can also be found on www.gov.uk.</p>

<p>14.	Individuals do not need to apply as, if they’re eligible, they’ll be paid automatically. The payments are not taxable and will not affect benefits or tax credits.</p>

<p>15.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are encouraged to share this information as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Managed move of claimants to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> has restarted</h2>

<p>16.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is resuming the programme to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/managed-move-of-claimants-to-universal-credit-set-to-restart">move all benefit claimants over to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr></a> by the end of 2024. This follows a pause to the process during the pandemic when staff were focused on supporting the surge of new claimants to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/completing-the-move-to-universal-credit">policy paper</a> on completing the move has been published on www.gov.uk.</p>

<p>17.	From May 2022, we have started to write to claimants on legacy benefits to let them know that they will move across to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and explain how the process will work. The letters to claimants are called ‘Migration Notices’ and will let claimants know that their legacy benefits are ending and that they have three months to make their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claim. To make sure our claimants are fully supported, initial volumes of claimants moving through the process will be small and controlled; initially five hundred across two locations, Medway and Bolton.</p>

<p>18.	Everyone moving over from legacy benefits will have their entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessed against their current claims, with top up payments (‘transitional protection’) provided for eligible claimants whose entitlement would have been reduced because of the change. This will ensure those claimants receive the same entitlement as on a legacy system and will continue unless their circumstances change.</p>

<p>19.	A dedicated helpline, signposted on the notice claimants receive, will provide support for people to make their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claim and guidance will also be available online including on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.understandinguniversalcredit.gov.uk/" rel="external">Understanding Universal Credit</a> website. Those in need of further support can also visit their local jobcentre.</p>

<p>20.	Additional support remains available for those in need, including the Household Support Fund and Discretionary Housing Payments.</p>

<h2>Invitation to the next Data sharing and IT consultation and engagement forum</h2>

<p>21.	The next forum will be held on <strong>Tuesday 5 July 2022</strong> from <strong>11am to 12noon</strong>.</p>

<h2>Joining instructions</h2>

<p>22.	The joining instructions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the MS Teams link to this forum has been shared in the version of the LAWD6/2022 that was sent directly to each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s single inbox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>note:</strong> It is more difficult to ask questions through dial-in so, if you anticipate having questions, we recommend joining through MS Teams where possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aim to join the event two or three minutes before the start time, as we intend to start promptly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speakers will be muted by default but instructions will be given during the event if you want to ask a question.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Forum agenda</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A 15-minute introduction from the Department for Work and Pensions, covering projects recently delivered, projects currently in delivery, insight into future planned projects, as well as the most recent common issues that have been reported to us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>30 to 45 minutes of questions from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on the call about the projects and matters covered in the introduction and any other IT and data sharing questions and issues <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If time allows, 15 minutes focused on suggestions from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> about future data sharing, data matching or automation projects that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> could consider funding and delivering.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>23.	The call will be recorded and the recording published on Glasscubes.</p>

<p>24.	The forum is open to all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and it would be beneficial for every <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> to have at least one representative dial into the forum to help us maximise feedback. Each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> representative should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>seek input and feedback from as many of their colleagues as possible prior to dialling in, for example, questions they might want answering</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have knowledge, at least at a high level, about data sharing, data matching and current IT topic areas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>feedback to their colleagues about how the conference call went, including the answers to the questions we asked.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>25.	We look forward to your participation on the call. However, if you have any questions in the meantime contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:paul.selby@dwp.gov.uk">paul.selby@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

During Q3 of financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr>) March 2022 there were 83,000 new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims and 1 million change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims processed in Great Britain (GB).</p>

<p>28.	For new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims, this is a decrease of 2,400 (3%) since last quarter, and a decrease of 4,700 (5%) when compared to the same quarter a year earlier.</p>

<p>29.	For change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims, this is a decrease of 140,000 (12%) since last quarter and a decrease of 310,000 (24%) when compared to the same quarter a year earlier.</p>

<h3>New Claims</h3>

<p>30.	The average time taken to process a new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim during Q3 for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 was 19 calendar days. This is one day higher than Q3 of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021.</p>

<h3>Change of circumstances</h3>

<p>31.	The average number of days taken to process a change of circumstance to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim during Q3 <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 was 8 calendar days. This is two days higher than Q3 of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2021.</p>

<h3>To note</h3>

<p>32.	Please note, sometimes we need to omit certain <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> data due to concerns over the quality of the data and details of the <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> not included are listed below. It should be noted however that the omission of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> data outlined below does not change the story in the release but can sometimes have a slight impact on regional level figures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics does not include figures for Gloucester City Council from December 2021 because of a cyber-attack suffered by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> impacting data provision. Therefore, speed of processing figures for Gloucester will be omitted in line with our standard approach for handling missing data or data with quality concerns. Analysis for Gloucester using historical data shows that the GB and regional (South West) level speed of processing figures are not impacted by the omission of Gloucester data. Volumes of both types of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims are likely to be affected by less than 1% at GB level and around 4% at regional (South West) level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>London Borough of Hackney has now resumed the supply of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, but because recovery work in Hackney is still ongoing, the statistics have been omitted until we are happy with the quality of the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to technical problems around IT systems, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics do not include change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims data for Cotswold District Council and Forest of Dean District Council for October 2021, Tandridge District Council for November and December 2021, Bassetlaw District Council for December 2021 and Oxford City Council for October, November and December 2021.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthermore, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics does not include new claims data for Tandridge and Rutland County Council for October 2021 and Oxford for October, November and December 2021. There were concerns with the data quality of these <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> for the periods outlined and the omission of this data is in line with our standard approach for handling missing data and data with concerns around quality.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>National Statistics on Fraud and Error in the benefit system (estimates) <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022</h2>

<p>33.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/housing-benefit-statistics-on-speed-of-processing-for-2021-to-2022">Fraud and Error National Statistics</a> for the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 were published on www.gov.uk on 26 May 2022.</p>

<p>34.	The statistics show that <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Overpayments decreased from 5.5% (£950 million) in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2021 to 5.2% (£860 million) in <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2022 and fraud decreased from 3.5% to 3.3% in 2022.

<p>35.	Although there has been a change to the calculation used to derive these figures, it is clear that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ hard work in connection with Verify Earnings and Pensions and the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Award Accuracy Initiative is paying off.</p>

<p>36.	We’d like to take this opportunity to thank authorities for their efforts.</p>
