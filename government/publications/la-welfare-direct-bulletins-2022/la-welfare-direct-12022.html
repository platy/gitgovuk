<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Happy New Year to all.</p>

<p>We know from our routine engagements with local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and from recent statistics that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are under a lot of pressure right now. For the first time in a long time, we are seeing processing times increase. Not only are you dealing with additional work pressures, such as the Test and Trace self-isolation payments, but also experiencing high levels of absence due to COVID-19 and in addition many of you are finding it hard to recruit. Behind the statistics is a human story of revenues and benefits staff pulling out the stops to help people in a time of crisis. I want to thank you all for that.</p>

<p>My team is facing some of the same challenges as we take on more work without certainty on our funding for next year, with key posts vacant and – of course – a relatively high rate of sickness absence. Despite this, we continue to focus on continuous improvement to support <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> delivery.</p>

<p>You’ll see below we are actively looking at how we can use Universal Credit data more effectively to support <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> business. We have had many asks over time to share more information but often this is without a clear rationale. We are looking at how the data could be used in practice working closely with <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> partners.</p>

<p>We have also reviewed the Payment Deductions Process, recognising this was not working as it should particularly in the early days. With other pressures, the Department might not be able to fix everything in one go but we have a strong intention to make the system work as well as it can and to remediate our records so we are all working with the same understanding of the customer’s position.</p>

<p>No doubt 2022 will bring new challenges for us all but I am confident we will all do our best to ensure the best possible service for the customer.</p>

<p>Clare Elliott <br>
Head of Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division</p>

<h2>Performance Measurement Housing Benefit annual programme 2022</h2>

<p>1. The Performance Measurement team provides national statistics on Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) fraud and error so the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) can understand the trends and reasons behind fraud and error in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>. The statistics also support decision making on the actions <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can take to reduce the level of fraud and error in the benefit system.</p>

<p>2. The performance measurement <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> annual programme information is taken into account by the National Audit Office in the annual audit of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s accounts. As <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> administer <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> payments on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, it is critical that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> work with the performance measurement team to provide the data required relating to the dates specified in Appendix A.</p>

<p>3. This vital information is used across government and plays an important role in helping <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> take action on actively reducing fraud and error.</p>

<p>4. The <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Performance Measurement programme for the 2023 Fraud and Error publication will commence in January 2022.</p>

<h2>Update: Local Government Data Sharing Transformation – Universal Credit data share</h2>

<p>6. In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-82021"><abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Direct Bulletin 8/2021</a> the Local Government Data Sharing Transformation (<abbr title="Local Government Data Sharing Transformation">LGDST</abbr>) team requested volunteers to form a Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) data sharing working group.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> selection process</h3>

<p>7. The request generated 90 expressions of interest and we would like to thank all the <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who volunteered.</p>

<p>8. <abbr title="Local Government Data Sharing Transformation">LGDST</abbr> considered a wide range of variables, including experience, geography, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT supplier, size of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and job role, to create a group that broadly represented the local government user base across England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>9. The group also includes welfare service employees that do not currently receive the Local Council Tax Reduction (<abbr title="Local Council Tax Reduction">LCTR</abbr>) data feed or use Searchlight (to help cover wider needs).</p>

<h3>Working group</h3>

<p>10. The working group were given various tasks to complete and events to attend either individually or together. Below is a selection of these tasks and events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Local Government Data Sharing Transformation">LGDST</abbr> visited a London Borough and spent half a day finding out about how the current data sharing position was affecting their service</li>
  <li>online workshops were held on 9 and 30 November 2021 to meet all participants and generate a list of data item requests and improvement suggestions for the <abbr title="Local Council Tax Reduction">LCTR</abbr> feed and Searchlight</li>
  <li>between workshops, working group members were asked to send detailed descriptions of their data sharing requests</li>
  <li>a space was created on our online collaborative tool (Glasscubes) for all involved, to share their knowledge and insight</li>
  <li>members have fed back facts, opinions and other information through a series of polls, assignments, questionnaires and discussions on Glasscubes</li>
</ul>

<p>11. The working group is making progress in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current arrangements for <abbr title="Local Council Tax Reduction">LCTR</abbr> data feed (also known as <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Digital Service)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> information available through Searchlight</li>
  <li>wider <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> needs for future <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data sharing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposed next steps</h3>

<p>12. We are aiming to make it easier and more efficient to receive input to shape the future of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> data sharing so that future workshops and discussions are able to focus more on the current impact of data shortfalls. This will result in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> being able to better estimate the positive impact of proposed changes and prioritise these.</p>

<p>13. We will continue detailed analysis, cross-checking and consultation work with <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and Searchlight teams with all the data collected so far. We will also be consulting <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT suppliers, whose knowledge and experience will give us a clear indication of what is possible moving forwards.</p>

<p>14. For further information contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.datasharingtransformation@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.datasharingtransformation@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Update: Payment Deduction Programme end-to-end review</h2>

<p>15. The Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery Division’s (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) Performance Development Team (<abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr>) have completed an end-to-end review of the Payment Deduction Programme (<abbr title="Payment Deduction Programme">PDP</abbr>) processes.</p>

<p>16. The review identified several issues and the aim is to address them all. However, <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr> are presently focusing on the following strands.</p>

<h3>Revision process</h3>

<p>17. The review identified an issue related to the processes used by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to create revisions to the amount of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt referral, where some non-genuine revisions continue to be created.</p>

<p>18. <abbr title="Performance Development Team">PDT</abbr> worked with a number of Capita and Civica <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to agree revisions to the existing e-mail workaround solution. An update detailing the revisions was posted on Glasscubes on 15 December 2021 and is available for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to consider and take appropriate action.</p>

<h3>Partial reconciliation</h3>

<p>19. On 10 November 2021, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> held a video conference call to inform <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> of the upcoming partial reconciliation exercise. The partial reconciliation exercise will identify cases held but not balances.</p>

<p>20. Details of the exercise were posted on Glasscubes on 21 November 2021 and 9 December 2021 which includes frequently asked questions and the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> tranche list and partial reconciliation guidance. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are encouraged to participate in this exercise to identify any missing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt referrals and to support further work expected in 2022 on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt balances.</p>

<p>21. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should note that the files for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in tranches one and two have now been uploaded to Transfer Your File. Tranche three is expected to be uploaded week commencing 10 January 2022. Tranche four will be uploaded week commencing 7 February 2022. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be notified of the upload via Glasscubes.</p>

<h3>Full reconciliation</h3>

<p>22. We aim to conduct a full reconciliation with all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> later in 2022 which will include reconciling <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt balances. We will commence planning and run a pilot for this exercise in early 2022 as we recognise the resource impact for both <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Updates will be provided as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> <abbr title="Payment Deduction Programme">PDP</abbr> queries</h3>

<p>23. A number of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have recently advised that they were not aware that queries can be raised directly with Debt Management by calling the Debt Management Contact Centre on 0800 916 0647. The Contact Centre was re-opened to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in May 2021 as communicated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-42021"><abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Direct bulletin 4/2021</a>.</p>

<p>24. We would be grateful if you ensure that relevant <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> debt recovery teams are made aware of this article.</p>

<p>25. Further updates will be provided as soon as they are available. However, if you have any urgent queries on the processes that are not covered in the material available on Glasscubes contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.pdt@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.pdt@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>
