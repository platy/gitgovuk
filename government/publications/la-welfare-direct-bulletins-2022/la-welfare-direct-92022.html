<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>Welcome to the September 2022 edition of the Local Authority Welfare Direct (<abbr title="Local Authority Welfare Direct">LAWD</abbr>) bulletin. I write this in late August, just a week away from the announcement of a new Prime Minister. Whoever it turns out to be, central government has made it clear that it has been working on options for them to make decisions on, in relation to the worsening cost of living crisis.</p>

<p>Whatever options are chosen, it is likely there will be impacts on various national and local welfare payments to be worked through. The work to support vulnerable local citizens never stops and you can be sure that my colleagues and I in the Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division will continue to work in partnership with local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) via our consultation groups to do our best to minimise any impacts.</p>

<p>The work on short notice policy announcements often makes the headlines and my own data sharing and data security teams play our part in delivering these initiatives. However, for me, it is very important that we maintain capacity to fund and deliver longer term more transformational changes. An example from 20 months ago being our work to share data with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> for Blue Badge administration purposes, which saved <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> £40 million a year in administration costs and significantly reduced the length of time for claimants to have Blue Badge permits issued or renewed.</p>

<p>In this <abbr title="Local Authority Welfare Direct">LAWD</abbr> you’ll see an article updating you about our work on the Care Home Information Sharing (<abbr title="Care Home Information Sharing">CHIS</abbr>) project. This will introduce the automated real time sharing of Care Home admissions and exits from <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>). This really will be a transformational change when completed. Currently, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> only ever finds out about 50% of admissions and exits and the ones we do find out about are reported very late. This is quite understandable from the perspective of the claimant and their families, as the reporting of such a life event to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is not at the forefront of their minds at, what can be, a very stressful time. The introduction of the data share should near eliminate overpayments, underpayments and any associated recovery or rebate activity and, hopefully, improve the overall claimant experience.</p>

<p>You’ll also find within important updates about the Payment Deduction Programme reconciliation exercise, Move to Universal Credit and much more. As ever, we hope you find the updates useful.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy what is left of the good weather in September!</p>

<p>Paul Selby, Deputy Divisional Manager, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr></p>

<h2>Reminder: How to complete the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> field on number of bedrooms for Local Housing Allowance households</h2>

<p>1.	The data provided by local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) through <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> (Single Housing Benefit Extract) on the number of bedrooms for Local Housing Allowance (<abbr title="Local Housing Allowance">LHA</abbr>) households is used by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts to look at issues around over-occupation and under-occupation. This helps build the evidence base to support decisions on what to do with <abbr title="Local Housing Allowance">LHA</abbr> uprating each year.</p>

<p>2.	The <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> guidance asks that for each <abbr title="Local Housing Allowance">LHA</abbr> household <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should record the number of bedrooms for which the claimant’s household has sole use in the property they are renting. If the number of bedrooms is unknown for an <abbr title="Local Housing Allowance">LHA</abbr> household then the <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> <strong>must leave the field blank</strong>.</p>

<p>3.	However, some <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are not leaving this field blank and are recording a zero in this field. This makes the analysis of this data set difficult to understand.</p>

<p>4.	Each individual <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> return is important as it enables <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts to present an overall picture across Great Britain.</p>

<p>5.	If you have any queries about the content of this article, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk</a> in the first instance.</p>

<h2>Rollout of the Payment Deduction Programme reconciliation and <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> conference call</h2>

<p>6.	Following the Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division’s Performance Development Team’s review of the Payment Deduction Programme (<abbr title="Payment Deduction Programme">PDP</abbr>) in 2018, we identified a need to reconcile <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) debts and balances against those held on the Department for Work and Pensions’ (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions’">DWPs</abbr>) Debt Management System.</p>

<p>7.	Both Debt Management and <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> are now in a position to commence rollout of the <abbr title="Payment Deduction Programme">PDP</abbr> reconciliation for all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in a staged approach. We will do this through a series of <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> tranches and the tranche details will be communicated and placed on Glasscubes once finalised. The first tranche of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will start in October 2022.</p>

<p>8.	We will be hosting an all <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> conference call on 20 September 2022 at 11am to 12 noon where more information will be provided. This will include the action for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to undertake prior to commencement of the rollout, an explanation of what will be required during the rollout, details of the tranches and an opportunity to ask questions. The call will be recorded and then placed on Glasscubes.</p>

<p>9.	All <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required to provide a single point of contact for this reconciliation exercise and more details will be covered during the call.</p>

<p>10.	The joining instructions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the MS Teams link to this forum has been shared in the version of the LAWD9/2022 that was sent directly to each <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr>’s single inbox.</li>
  <li>note: It is more difficult to ask questions through telephone dial-in so, if you anticipate having questions, we recommend joining through MS Teams where possible.</li>
  <li>aim to join the event two or three minutes before the start time, as we intend to start promptly.</li>
  <li>speakers will be muted by default but instructions will be given during the event if you want to ask a question.</li>
</ul>

<p>11.	Details for this event will also be posted on Glasscubes by 12 September 2022.</p>

<p>12.	We look forward to your participation on the call during which detailed information will be provided. However, if you need to contact us in advance email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:michelle.fazackerley@dwp.gov.uk">michelle.fazackerley@dwp.gov.uk</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helen.hilland@dwp.gov.uk">helen.hilland@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Update: Care Home Information Service solution</h2>

<p>13.	Since the last update in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-122021">LAWD12/2021</a>, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> has continued working with Adult Social Care (<abbr title="Adult Social Care">ASC</abbr>) IT software suppliers to design and develop the Care Home Information Service (<abbr title="Care Home Information Sharing">CHIS</abbr>) solution.</p>

<h3>Latest position</h3>

<p>14.	<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> is working towards starting an early adopter trial from November 2022 with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, <abbr title="Adult Social Care">ASC</abbr> IT software suppliers and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff administering Attendance Allowance.</p>

<p>15.	This trial will be with a small number of early adopter <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> is currently engaging with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to identify those who will support this.</p>

<p>16.	The trial will be testing the automated data sharing solution as well as the care home information that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> send to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Attendance Allowance staff via the automated process. Those staff will then use this data to make a decision on a citizen’s Attendance Allowance payments.</p>

<p>17.	Throughout the duration of the trial <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be gathering management information and the outcomes will be used to support and inform our future wider implementation approach.</p>

<p>18.	There will be minimal impact on <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> throughout the trial period and <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> will share the findings as the trial progresses.</p>

<p>19.	Subject to the trial progressing as planned, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is aiming to onboard the automated data sharing solution to all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> from early 2023.</p>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>20.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is currently gathering some early insight into matching <abbr title="Adult Social Care">ASC</abbr> information to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> information and has issued a questionnaire to a number of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to provide this insight. The plan is to issue this questionnaire to all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> working with <abbr title="Adult Social Care">ASC</abbr> systems in mid to late September 2022.</p>

<p>21.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be looking at the requirements for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to connect to the <abbr title="Care Home Information Sharing">CHIS</abbr> solution and <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> will supply guidance and instructions to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> in readiness for implementation.</p>

<p>22.	If you need any further information, do not hesitate to contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.ladsdeliveryteam@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.ladsdeliveryteam@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Award Accuracy Initiative: Year 2 outcomes</h2>

<p>23.	Many <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have asked for the outcomes from the first full year (in other words, financial year ending March 2022) of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Award Accuracy (<abbr title="HB Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr>) Initiative.</p>

<p>24.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts have calculated outcomes as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A        total overpayments = £37.7 million</li>
  <li>B        total underpayments = £11.8 million</li>
  <li>C        total delivery costs = £7.0 million</li>
  <li>D        benefit cost ratio (A minus B divided by C) = 3.7 to 1</li>
</ul>

<p>25.	Benefit cost ratio by individual component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full Case Reviews = 2.71 to 1</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit Matching Service rules = 8.04 to 1</li>
  <li>Self-Employment Reviews = 5.74 to 1</li>
</ul>

<p>26.	We would like to take this opportunity to thank all participating <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> for their hard work in achieving these results and for striving to ensure <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims are paid correctly.</p>

<p>27.	 If you have any queries regarding the <abbr title="HB Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.frauderrordebt@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.frauderrordebt@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Personal Independence Payment extension exercise for claims awaiting review</h2>

<p>28.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has seen an unprecedented increase in the volume of Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) new claims and is currently prioritising assessing new claims.</p>

<p>29.	To ensure that claims awaiting review do not go out of payment we have been extending them 28 days before their end date by three months. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is planning to automatically extend existing claims awaiting review by up to 12 months and will do this 35 days before their end date.</p>

<p>30.	<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will continue to receive <abbr title="Automated Transfer to LA Systems">ATLAS</abbr> (Automated Transfer to <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> Systems) notifications as normal and Blue Badge renewal requests linked to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> extensions should reduce.</p>

<p>31.	This change is planned to start from 6 September 2022. The <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr> Security and Support Team will confirm the change has been successfully implemented via Glasscubes.</p>

We announced in July’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2022/la-welfare-direct-72022">LAWD7/2022</a> that <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> was planning to hold regional workshops for participants of the <abbr title="HB Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr> Initiative and the Verify Earnings and Pensions (<abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr>) service starting in October 2022.</p>

<p>34.	These events have now been finalised and will run from mid-October to mid-November 2022. All information about these workshops was sent directly to <abbr title="local authority's">LA</abbr>’s single inboxes on 26 August 2022. The deadline to request a space at one of the face-to-face or virtual workshops is Friday 9 September 2022.</p>

<p>35.	For any further informationcontact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.correspondence@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.correspondence@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>New Style Employment and Support Allowance: Change to new claims telephone number</h2>

<p>36.	The telephone number to call to make a New Style Employment and Support Allowance new claims is changing. From 12 September 2022 the telephony number to call will be 0800 055 6688. This line will be open 8am to 5pm to align with Working Age.</p>

<p>37.	This is a shared line, with New Style Employment and Support Allowance joining New Style Job Seekers Allowance and Maternity Allowance new claims.  Once connected to the line, callers will be given all three options to choose from.</p>

<p>38.	From 12 September, any calls made to the old number (0800 328 5644) will get a recorded message directing them to the new line.</p>

<p>39.	The Benefit Enquiry line telephony number 0800 169 0310, remains unchanged and should be used for all enquires after a new claim has been made. Text, Relay UK and Welsh language line numbers also remain unchanged.</p>

<h2>Managed move of claimants to Universal Credit: Discovery phase expands to Harrow and Northumberland</h2>

<p>40.	In April 2022, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> announced plans to resume the programme to move all benefit claimants over to Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) by 2024.</p>

<p>41.	From 15 August 2022, we expanded our discovery phase to include Harrow. We will now expand our discovery phase to Northumberland from mid-September 2022.</p>

<p>42.	During the discovery phase we will send a migration notice to a small number of claimants on legacy benefits to let them know that they need to move across to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, explain how the process will work and what they will need to do.</p>

<p>43.	Everyone moving over from legacy benefits as part of this process will have their entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessed against their current claims, with transitional protection provided for eligible claimants whose initial <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> entitlement would have been less than their entitlement to legacy benefits at the point of moving to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>. These will continue unless their entitlement changes.</p>

<p>44.	A dedicated helpline (signposted on the migration notice claimants receive) will provide support for people to make their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claim, and guidance will also be available online including on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.understandinguniversalcredit.gov.uk/" rel="external">Understanding Universal Credit</a> website. Those in need of further support can also visit their local jobcentre.</p>

<p>45.	Additional support remains available for those in need, including the Household Support Fund and Discretionary Housing Payments.</p>
