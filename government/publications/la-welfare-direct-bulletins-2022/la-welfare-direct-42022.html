<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information.</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>This is usually a very busy time of year for local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and this year is no exception as recent government announcements to ‘support vulnerable households with rising energy costs’ have placed extra pressures on <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>We have launched the Housing Benefit Award Accuracy Initiative for the financial year ending March 2023 and I’m pleased to see that very few <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have asked to opt out due to exceptional circumstances. This is a huge achievement given the pressures <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are under, particularly with the energy rebate being delivered through Council Tax and the tail-end of the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme.</p>

<p>The government also announced an extension to the Household Support Fund in the Spring Budget on 23 March 2022, which provides an additional £421 million for County Council and Unitary Authorities to support vulnerable families for the period 1 April to 30 September 2022. The Barnett formula applies in the usual way to the additional £421 million funding in England. So, the devolved administrations will receive up to £79 million of the £500 million (£41 million for the Scottish Government, £25 million for the Welsh Government and £14 million for the Northern Ireland Executive). We have been working with HM Treasury and other government departments to finalise the guidance which was issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> on Friday 1 April 2022, together with other supporting information including the grant agreement, management information templates and planning questionnaire.</p>

<p>At least one third of the total funding must be spent on families with children and at least one third must be spent on pensioners. In terms of type of support, the expectation is that the Household Support Fund extension should be used in a similar way as the original scheme, with a greater emphasis on supporting households with energy bills. Food and water bills also remain priorities. It can also be used to support households with essential costs related to those items and with wider essential costs. In exceptional cases of genuine emergency, it can additionally be used to support housing costs where existing housing support schemes do not meet this exceptional need.</p>

<p>Hopefully. as COVID-19 restrictions continue to be lifted and the effect of the pandemic on people’s health is reducing due to the vaccination rollout, the new financial year will return to some form of normality. After two years of avoiding the virus I had a positive lateral flow and PCR test on 28 and 29 March respectively. Hopefully I’m over the worst of my flu type systems and the infection will also help to increase my resistance to the virus.</p>

<p>After 40 years of service I’m due to retire in June this year, so this will be my last editorial. I spent 18 years working in Revenue and Benefits with four <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> before joining the Department for Work and Pensions in March 2000. I joined the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Partnership, Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division in June 2014 and managed to reconnect with many old <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> colleagues at IRRV and other <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> events. I really enjoyed my early career working in <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. It certainly gave me a “can do” attitude that has served me well throughout the years. I wish everyone the very best and, you never know, we may bump into each other at a future <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> event. I’d like to thank everyone I’ve worked with and known over the years for a long and enjoyable career. Thank you.</p>

<p>2. Unfortunately, a number of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> did not meet the standard deadline or contact the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) to request and agree an extension.</p>

<p>3. Therefore, we ask that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who have not yet forwarded the required notification to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to do so immediately by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.hbassurance@dwp.gov.uk</a> or contact us at the same email address to formally request an extension to the deadline. Any such request should include the current status of the procurement and detailed reasons for the delay.</p>

<p>4. The notification confirming the audit firm procurement should include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the audit firm</li>
  <li>length of the contract</li>
  <li>lead audit contact name</li>
  <li>audit office location</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Do note, if an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> secured a multi-year engagement with a reporting accountant that covers HBAP in respect of the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 and <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 and previously notified <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of that engagement, then further notification is not required.</p>

<h2>Urgent reminder: Completion of Baseline Personal Security Standards checks</h2>

<p>6. This is a reminder that Local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) must complete the Baseline Personal Security Standards (<abbr title="Baseline Personal Security Standards">BPSS</abbr>) checks and enter the appropriate dates onto Employee Authentication Service – Replacement (EAS-R) by 20 April 2022.</p>

<p>7. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will begin to remove access for those EAS-R users that do not have their <abbr title="Baseline Personal Security Standards">BPSS</abbr> dates recorded by this deadline. This will prevent these users from accessing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data and systems.</p>

<p>8. Note: Tell Us Once users have until 12 April 2022 to record these dates onto EAS-R.</p>

<p>9. If you have any questions on this article, contact the <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> Security Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lasecurity@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lasecurity@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Reminder: Discretionary Housing Payments end of year final claim form for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 (England and Wales only) due by 30 April 2022</h2>

<p>10. The Discretionary Housing Payments (DHP) end of year (EOY) final claim form was issued to local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) in England and Wales on 10 March 2022. It included updated completion guidance on the information being requested and the return email address.</p>

<p>11. The final claim form for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 combines the previous two forms for mandatory and voluntary information.</p>

<p>12. The form asks for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the actual DHP expenditure paid by your <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022</li>
  <li>additional management information (<abbr title="management information">MI</abbr>) to help inform future funding.</li>
</ul>

<p>13. The <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> monitoring return information continues to improve the department’s understanding of how <abbr title="Discretionary Housing Payments">DHPs</abbr> are being used to support claimants. Additionally, these returns will help us better understand the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>14. The DHP Payments (grants) Order 2001 has been amended to legislate the provision of the above information and the date by which <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must provide the information.</p>

<p>15. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must return the completed DHP EOY claim form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dhp.returns@dwp.gov.uk">dhp.returns@dwp.gov.uk</a> by no later than 30 April 2022.</p>

<p>16. Any questions can also be issued to the email provided above.</p>

<h2>Reminder: Changes to the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> access to data</h2>

<p>17. As advised in March’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2022/la-welfare-direct-lite-32022">LAWD3/2022</a> lite bulletin, the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme ended in England on 24 February 2022.</p>

<p>18. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>&nbsp;in England can continue to access Searchlight until 29 April 2022, after which permission to use the service for the scheme will be revoked.</p>

<p>19. Therefore, on the evening of 29 April 2022, the Searchlight user role ‘SG_Get_Income_Information_Addon’ will be automatically removed from users and the data will no longer be available.</p>

<p>20. If you have any questions contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LAWELFARE.LASUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">lawelfare.lasupport@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Update: Use of HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ real time earnings and non-state pension information</h2>

<p>21. In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2020/la-welfare-direct-122020">LAWD12/2020</a>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> informed <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that Verify Earnings and Pensions (<abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr>) could be used for Local Council Tax Reduction purposes and detailed how this was possible.</p>

<p>22. However, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has been contacted by several <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> requesting further use of the HM Revenue &amp; Customs’ (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) real time earnings and non-state pensions information received from <abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr> for additional <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> related purposes.</p>

<p>23. Therefore, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has sought further legal clarification in collaboration with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and this article aims to provide comprehensive clarity on the legality of using <abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr> for additional purposes.</p>

<h2>Discretionary Housing Payments, Disabled Facilities Grant and Disability Adaptation Grant</h2>

<p>24. The Welfare Reform Act 2012 and the Social Security (Information sharing in relation to Welfare Services) Regulations 2012 allow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to share earnings/non-state pension data with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to share with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> earnings/non-state pension data received for the purposes of DHP (England, Scotland and Wales), Disabled Facilities Grant (<abbr title="Disabled Facilities Grant">DFG</abbr>) (England and Wales) and Disability Adaptation Grant (<abbr title="Disability Adaptation Grant">DAG</abbr>) (Scotland).</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to hold <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> earnings/non-state pension data they receive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific further caveats in relation to the legality</h2>

<p>25. However, to be clear, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> are not allowing any additional data to be shared as the law does not allow this. For example, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should not submit non-<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> National Insurance numbers in their monthly <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Debt Service submission as this would result in additional data being shared.</p>

<p>26. When accessing information via the <abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr> portal, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will need to set the interest to view the <abbr title="Verify Earnings and Pensions">VEP</abbr> information for non-<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims. In doing so it should be remembered that the interest will be automatically unset on the 27th of the month for cases that are not claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>. This prevents unnecessary data sharing and ensures <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> keep within existing legislation.</p>

<p>27. We have updated the Memorandum of Understanding between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to take into account the contents of this article, which will be shared shortly with all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>28. However, if you have any questions email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lasecurity@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lasecurity@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Change of tax year for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Matching Service self-assessment</h2>

<p>29. At present, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Matching Service (<abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr>) self-assessment referrals are matched against the tax year 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>30. From week commencing 11 April 2022, <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals will be matched against the tax year 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>31. This means all local authorities will receive higher volumes of referrals and (possible) duplications within the first month of this change. However, volumes will start to decrease by month two of implementation.</p>

<p>32. Note: As stated last year in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-82021">LAWD8/2021</a> changes to the tax year for <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> will now be implemented in April of each year in line with HM Revenue and Customs procedures.</p>

<p>33. The following rules, which are detailed in the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> rule guide on Glasscubes, will be impacted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HBSA002</li>
  <li>HBSA003</li>
  <li>HBSA004</li>
</ul>

<p>34. If you have any questions, you can contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.datamatching@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Changes to supported housing and temporary accommodation Single Housing Benefit Extract management information</h2>

<p>35. In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-122021">LAWD12/2021</a>, we provided <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with an update on changes being brought in as part of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT system releases between April 2022 and June 2022. This was to support the improved recording of management information for supported housing and temporary accommodation cases.</p>

<p>36. Circular <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-benefit-subsidy-circulars-2022/s32022-additional-new-burdens-funding-to-meet-the-costs-of-implementing-the-improvements-to-supported-accommodation-and-temporary-accommodation-sing">S3/2022</a> was issued to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> detailing New Burdens funding to support activity connected with this change. In addition, an A circular is planned to be issued in April 2022, providing further information on the change and key activities required of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to support implementation. The circular should be read in conjunction with <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT supplier release notes. Note: Civica <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will not have access to IT release notes until their planned system upgrades in June 2022.</p>

<h2>All <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> call</h2>

<p>37. To further support <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with the implementation of the change, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is holding an ‘all <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Call’ on 28 April 2022 from 10am to 11.15am, during which we will provide an overview of the change requirements and activities.</p>

<p>38. The event is primarily aimed at providing an opportunity for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to ask any questions and raise any specific issues requiring clarification. We strongly encourage <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to join the call.</p>

<p>39. The joining instructions are:</p>

<p>the MS Teams link to this conference has been shared in the version of the LAWD4/2022 that was were sent directly to each <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> single inbox.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>note: It is more difficult to ask questions via dial in, so if you anticipate having questions, using the link is recommended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>speakers will be muted by default but instructions will be given during the event if you want to ask a question.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>40. We look forward to your participation on the call. However, if you have any</p>

<p>questions in the meantime contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lasupport@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lasupport@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Sharing of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT system screenshots to claimants via <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> digital portals</h2>

<p>41. It has been brought to our attention that <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> could be inadvertently sharing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> system screenshots that have been saved to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> digital portals. Potentially your <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> digital portal may have settings activated that would allow a claimant to view documents on their digital portal account, including screenshots from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems (such as, Searchlight/Transfer Your File).</p>

<p>42. Screenshots contain data that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has shared with your <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> for specific reasons. The terms of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>) apply to data sharing irrespective of the format it is in. This is regardless of whether the data has been captured through a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT system screenshot, manually typed into an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s IT system or viewed on a screen by a member of <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> staff. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must store data securely in accordance with the security requirements of the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<p>43. If <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> want to use data for another purpose than set out in the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>, they must request permission from <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lasecurity@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lasecurity@dwp.gov.uk</a> <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> must store data securely in accordance with the security requirements of the <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr>.</p>

<p>44. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should not disclose any <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> system screenshots to claimants through their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> digital portals. All claimants requesting such information are required to complete a Right of Access Request.</p>

<p>45. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> need to review their digital portal settings and take action if any <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> system screenshots are being shared with claimants that should not be.</p>

<p>46. We ask that this information is brought to the attention of all appropriate staff within each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<p>47. If you have any questions regarding the content of this article you can email the address given above.</p>

<h2>Sharing of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT system screenshots with auditors</h2>

<p>48. It has been brought to our attention that auditors have been asking <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to provide screenshots of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT systems, for example Searchlight, when auditing claims. In the first instance, the existing process of ‘over the shoulder’ viewing by auditors should remain the common practice when audits are taking place.</p>

<p>49. Screenshots must only be shared with auditors in exceptional circumstances provided they are shared securely and only include the data the auditor has requested and has a business need to see.</p>

<p>50. All audit firms that are eligible to complete this work must provide assurance to the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> that employees conducting the audit are either Baseline Personal Security Standards (<abbr title="Baseline Personal Security Standards">BPSS</abbr>) checked or meet the requirements of <abbr title="Baseline Personal Security Standards">BPSS</abbr> standards</p>

<h2>Transformation of Single <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Extract returns to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>51. As detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-122021">LAWD12/2021</a> <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> currently share their <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> administration data with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on a four 4-week rolling cycle. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> manually extract details of their entire <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> case load, save and send it to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> using the Single <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Extract (<abbr title="Single HB Extract">SHBE</abbr>) process.</p>

<p>52. Often <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>’ extractions dates are up to a week before the data is scheduled for delivery, perhaps because extraction takes some time and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> need to check data formats before it is sent on to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Additionally, if data fails to load to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are asked to check and re-submit their data. This process will further impact the age of the data.</p>

<p>53. This can result in a time lag of up to three months for the resulting ‘All <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’ <abbr title="Single HB Extract">SHBE</abbr> <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> dataset, used for national statistics and policy analysis. It also means that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> often uses data that is between one to six weeks old for fraud and error purposes, which increases the impact of inaccurate data matching if further changes have occurred since the date the data was extracted.</p>

<p>54. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has been working closely with our digital group and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT software suppliers on a project to identify ways for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to send their <abbr title="Single HB Extract">SHBE</abbr> data via a ‘real time’ Application Programming Interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>). Using this approach also fits with DWPs’ strategic view for data sharing. This would mean uploading changes as they occur on a daily basis.</p>

<h2>Project update</h2>

<p>55. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is working with <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and their IT suppliers to test the proof of concept for the project and it is estimated that this will be completed by June 2022.</p>

<p>56. Following successful completion of the proof of concept, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will work with <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT Suppliers to design, build and test the new <abbr title="Single HB Extract">SHBE</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> solution. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will then work with a number of early adopter <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> from each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> IT Suppliers to test and implement the final solution in 2022.</p>

<p>57. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will then work with all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to migrate to the automated solution based on their capability and level of readiness. The intention is that all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will download and install the new software within a month of it being available to each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> from their software supplier releases. A period of dual running will be required, but the aim is to keep this as short a period as possible.</p>

<p>58. Further information regarding progress of the <abbr title="Single HB Extract">SHBE</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> solution will be communicated to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> as the project progresses to allow <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to plan ahead.</p>

<p>59. If you need any further information contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.ladsdeliveryteam@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.ladsdeliveryteam@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Guidance on generating a monthly list of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals</h2>

<p>60. Following the launch of the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Award Accuracy Initiative (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Award Accuracy">HBAA</abbr>) and the subsequent decommission of the <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> clerical spreadsheet, a number of local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) contacted the Local Authority, Partner Engagement and Delivery (<abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr>) division requesting a process that will continue to provide <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with a full list of <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> referrals each month.</p>

<p>61. Therefore, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> provided a blank macro-enabled spreadsheet with supporting guidance to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> through Glasscubes only.</p>

<p>62. Note: The use of the spreadsheet is unsupported by <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are responsible for maintaining their own versions.</p>

<p>63. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should not use this spreadsheet to return any <abbr title="HB Matching Service">HBMS</abbr> results to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Planned Housing Benefit Cost Refresh exercise for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023</h2>

<p>65. In previous years, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> carried out <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Cost Refresh exercises to help accurately calculate the costs of delivering <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and understand the levels of funding provided through <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Administration Subsidy (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Administration Subsidy">HBAS</abbr>) and other new burdens.</p>

<p>66. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we made the decision not to run <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> cost refresh exercises for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2020, 2021 and 2022. So, it is even more important that we update our data for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023.</p>

<p>67. We are reliant on local authorities’ (<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>) contributions in making the exercise a success. We recognise that <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> resources are now stretched more so than ever and, therefore, we are committed to making the process as simple as possible.</p>

<p>68. We do appreciate this is an additional ask of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. Therefore, we are not planning to launch this exercise until late May/early June 2022, at which time we will fully support all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who take part.</p>

<p>69. If you think your <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> may be in a position to participate and you would like more information, please contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lafunding@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lafunding@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Council Tax debt data-sharing pilot</h2>

<p>74. In 2019, through the Digital Economy Act’s Debt Powers, a Council Tax debt data-sharing pilot between <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and 29 local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) across England and Wales was successfully completed.</p>

<p>75. The pilot saw a debt recovery rate of 20% (£5 million) against an estimated baseline of 3% recovery for such debt.</p>

<p>76. A key success metric of this first pilot was that previously unresponsive debtors began to engage with their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> after receiving notification of the data held and subsequently entered into payment plans or, in some cases, cleared their debt immediately.</p>

<p>77. Following the success of the original pilot, the Fraud and Debt Digital Economy Act Team in Cabinet Office facilitated a new iteration in 2021. This ongoing second pilot includes <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s income-based benefits data (the frequency and amount of benefits received, but not the benefit type) being provided alongside <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> PAYE and Self Assessment data to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>78. This second pilot aims to strengthen the vulnerability identification of Council Tax debtors by identifying if attachment-of-benefit orders are appropriate for some debtors and strengthening the application of attachment-of-earning orders. It is anticipated that greater recovery rates than in the first pilot will be achieved.</p>

<p>79. The Cabinet Office is currently reaching out to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> who would like to be a part of the business as usual provision which we hope to progress in the second half of 2022. If you would like to be included or want to know more, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dea-data-sharing-fraud-and-debt@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">dea-data-sharing-fraud-and-debt@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a> to be added to our mailing list. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> can currently be based in England, Wales or Scotland and do not need to have been involved in a Digital Economy Act data share before.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>80. Upon the completion of the second pilot, the intention is for this data-sharing to become business as usual; allowing <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to regularly access <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data for those with Council Tax debt liability orders. Discussions are continuing as to how best this ongoing data-share could manifest, with an Application Programming Interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>) provision being the most likely solution at present. Importantly, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are leading this discussion and are outlining how such data-sharing can meet their needs.</p>

<h2>Practitioners’ Operational Group and <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Steering Group</h2>

<p>81. The last <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Welfare Steering Group (<abbr title="Local Authority Welfare Steering Group">LAWSG</abbr>) meeting took place on 17 March 2022. Agenda items included Discretionary Housing Payments, Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> (voluntary), Move to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> (mandatory), Penalty Reform and Ukraine refugees.</p>

<p>82. Both groups’ meeting are held bi-monthly (and alternately) so the next meeting of the Practitioners’ Operational Group (<abbr title="Practitioners’ Operational Group">POG</abbr>) is scheduled to take place on 21 April 2022.</p>

<p>83. If you have any questions regarding topics raised at these consultation groups, you can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.correspondence@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.correspondence@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>
