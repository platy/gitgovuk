<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All Housing Benefit staff</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>For information</p>

<h2>Editorial</h2>

<p>February is finally here and with it, I hope, better weather. However, the level of work and challenges ahead for us all shows no sign of letting up.</p>

<p>You’ll see in this month’s edition that the financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr>) March 2022 quarter 2 (<abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr>) speed of processing statistics have been published. The numbers are marginally higher than for the same period last year but your efforts in maintaining high levels of service are to be commended.</p>

<p>Intelligence gathered from our Performance Relationship Managers engagement with you shows that work pressures and COVID-19 related impacts significantly affected <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr>. Indicative data and anecdotal intelligence suggests that performance will continue to be impacted throughout <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022, due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic. We will continue to support you through this period and into <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023, where key initiatives such as Verify Earnings and Pensions and Housing Benefit Award Accuracy (soon to be relaunched) will be key in enabling prevention and reductions in Fraud and Error in Housing Benefit.</p>

<p>As spring is just around the corner so is the conference season and I hope we’ll be able to get out and see you face-to-face at some of these events. We’re starting to think about our key messages and topics to cover for upcoming events, so look out for further details in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>Take care until next time.</p>

<p>Darren Baker<br>
Head of Change &amp; Communications, Fraud, Error &amp; Debt Team</p>

<h2>Further extension to deadline: Submission of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> final tested claims and assurance reports/audit certificates for financial year ending March 2021</h2>

<p>1. Final tested claims for Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) subsidy and subsequent <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Assurance Process (<abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>) reports (in England) and audit certificates (in Scotland and Wales) are normally provided to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) by 30 November following the end of each assurance period.</p>

<p>2. As advised in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/la-welfare-direct-bulletins-2021/la-welfare-direct-52021">LAWD5/2021</a>, following stakeholder engagement feedback, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> initially extended the standard submission deadline from 30 November to 31 January for financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr>) March 2021 and March 2022 assurance periods.</p>

<p>3. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has considered recent representations from local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and audit firms facilitating <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr> that due to continued pandemic related resource pressures and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities extension to the deadline for the Local Authority Final Accounts work, that a high percentage of assured <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy claims in respect of the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021 assurance period will not be completed by the extended deadline of 31 January 2022.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> understands that these pressures continue to affect the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021 so, to provide certainty to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and the audit firms facilitating <abbr title="Housing Benefit Assurance Process">HBAP</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is further extending the deadline to 28 February 2022.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy forms a significant part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Annual Reports and Accounts and carries the expectation that provision of actual <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy spend can be incorporated into each accounting period on a timely basis. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy claims submitted post November in any accounting period impacts that expectation and raises a risk to the accurate provision of the department’s annual reports and accounts. Therefore, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> encourages <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to work with reporting accountants and auditors to finalise work on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy claim.</p>

<p>6. Where <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> believe final tested claims/audit certificates and assurance reports will not be submitted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> by 28 February 2022, they should contact the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Payments Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.lapaymentsandsubsidy@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.lapaymentsandsubsidy@dwp.gov.uk</a> providing detailed reasons for not being able to do so. Extension requests will only be considered in exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy withholdings</h2>

<p>7. By exception, all <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy withholdings applied to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> ceased following the April 2020 subsidy payment.</p>

<p>8. Following a review period, withholdings recommenced on 1 July 2021 for all outstanding final tested claims up to and including for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2019. The application of withholdings will be extended and applied to all outstanding final tested claims up to and including those for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2020. The withholdings will continue for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2019 and be applied at 5%, increasing to a maximum of 35%, in line with normal practice, for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2020.</p>

<p>9. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> expenditure is significant (around £17 billion for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2020) and the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> subsidy claim and assurance process is key to providing the required assurances for this spend. Whilst we appreciate that these are unprecedented times, the importance of reporting accurate spend to published timescales is important.</p>

<p>10. We will continue to monitor the <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021 situation and review the withholding position as a matter of course.</p>

<h2>New Adult Disability Payment in Scotland</h2>

<p>11. The Scottish Government’s next benefit, Adult Disability Payment (<abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr>) will open for new applications in pilot areas from 21 March 2022.</p>

<p>12. This new payment will be administered by Social Security Scotland and replace the Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>), which is currently delivered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>13. Working Age adults with a disability or health condition, who are not already in receipt of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> or Disability Living Allowance for Adults (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>), and living in Dundee City, Perth and Kinross and the Western Isles <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> areas will be the first to be able to apply from 21 March 2022.</p>

<p>14. Further <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> areas will be introduced in phases until <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> rolls out nationwide across Scotland from August 2022.</p>

<p>15. Claimants with ongoing awards of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> do not need to apply for <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr>. Their awards will be transferred automatically to the new Scottish system from August 2022, with no break in entitlement or payment. Further details on this will be shared when it becomes available.</p>

<h2>Impact on <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>16. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> should follow business as usual procedures and treat <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> in the same way as they currently do with <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. For example, if severe disability premium is payable on a <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim because of a claimant’s <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> award the same severe disability premium will be payable as a result of their <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> claim.</p>

<p>17. <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>’s IT software suppliers are making the required changes to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> systems and will provide further updates when this has been completed.</p>

<p>18. As with current <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will notify <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> that the benefit cap does not apply where <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> has been awarded.</p>

<p>19. If a claimant notifies their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> that they are in receipt of <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> and the benefit cap is still being applied, the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> should complete and return the benefit cap email notification template to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> using the existing business as usual process.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>

<p>20.	The timeline for the introduction of <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phase one: pilot takes place in Perth and Kinross, Dundee City and Western Isles from 21 March 2022</li>
  <li>Phase two: pilot takes place in Perth and Kinross, Dundee City, Western Isles, Angus, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire from 20 June 2022</li>
  <li>Phase three: pilot takes place in Perth and Kinross, Dundee City, Western Isles, Angus, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Fife, City of Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray, North Ayrshire, East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire from 25 July 2022</li>
  <li>Nationwide rollout across Scotland from 29 August 2022</li>
  <li>People who currently get disability benefits from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will have their awards transferred to the new Scottish system in stages after the new benefits are introduced from summer 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>21. More information on the <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> rollout schedule in August 2022 across the rest of Scotland will be shared when it is available.</p>

<p>22. You can find out more about <abbr title="Adult Disability Payment">ADP</abbr> on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.mygov.scot/" rel="external">www.mygov.scot</a>.</p>

On 25 November 2021 the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-11-25/hcws420" rel="external">announced the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates</a> for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2023 will be maintained at the elevated cash rates agreed for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021.</p>

<p>24.

Recent user engagement identified that an explanation as to how we calculate average speed of processing could be helpful to our users.</p>

<p>29. The quarterly publication data is extracted from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> (Single Housing Benefit Extract). This is the mechanism by which <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data is provided by <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>30. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> measures the average speed of processing for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in calendar days. The table below shows three fictitious claims for one <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and the number of processing days calculated for each example:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Date most recent HB claim was received (LDHBREC)</th>
      <th scope="col">Date of first decision on most recent HB claim (LDHBDEC)</th>
      <th scope="col">Number of processing days (measured in calendar days)</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>18 March 2021</td>
      <td>28 April 2021</td>
      <td>42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6 April 2021</td>
      <td>23 April 2021</td>
      <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>22 November 2020</td>
      <td>19 April 2021</td>
      <td>149</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Total number of processing days for April 2021</td>
      <td>209</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>The calculation</h3>

<p>31.	The calculation used for the average speed of processing is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>number of processing days for a claim is calculated as the difference between the date the most recent <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim was received (<abbr title="Date most recent HB claim was received">LDHBREC</abbr>) and the date of the first decision on the most recent <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim (<abbr title="Date of first decision on most recent HB claim">LDHBDEC</abbr>). In the above example, 18 March is day zero and 28 April is day 42</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the total number of processing days for any given <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is calculated by adding up all the processing days for every claim. So, using the examples in the table above, the total number of processing days for April is 209 calendar days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the total number of processing days is then divided by the total number of claims to get the average speed of processing for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in calendar days. This calculation is always rounded to the nearest calendar day. So, using the three example claims in the table above the average speed of processing is 70 calendar days (in other words 209 divided by 3).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>32. Again, using the example, as all three claims were processed in April 2021 (based on the <abbr title="Date of first decision on most recent HB claim">LDHBDEC</abbr> field) the data would be published in the April data of the 2021 to 2022 quarter 1 publication.</p>

<p>33. Do note, we cannot amend data that is reported in <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> once it has been submitted by an <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. As explained in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/housing-benefit-speed-of-processing-statistics-methodology-note/housing-benefit-speed-of-processing-statistics-methodology-note">methodology note</a>, if data quality issues exist and we cannot verify the results in time for the release then our current practice is to omit the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> data from a publication release at a monthly and/or quarterly level.</p>

<p>34. If you have any questions regarding this article, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cbm.stats@dwp.gov.uk">cbm.stats@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Publication of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics for July to September 2021</h2>

<p>35. The department <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/housing-benefit-statistics-on-speed-of-processing-for-2021-to-2022">published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics</a> and associated data for quarter 2 (<abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr>) on Wednesday 26 January 2022.</p>

<h3>Some key points</h3>

<p>36. During <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 there were 86,000 new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims and 1.1 million change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims processed in GB.</p>

<p>37. For new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims, volumes have remained stable since last quarter, and there has been a decrease of 5,200 (6%) when compared to the same quarter a year earlier (quarter 2 2020 to 2021).</p>

<p>38. For change of circumstances to existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims, there has been a decrease of 500,000 (31%) since last quarter and a decrease of 92,000 (7%) when compared to the same quarter a year earlier.</p>

<h3>New Claims</h3>

<p>39. The average time taken to process a new <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim during <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> for <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 was 20 calendar days. This is three days higher than <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2021.</p>

<h3>Change of Circumstances</h3>

<p>40. The average number of days taken to process a change of circumstance to an existing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim during <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> March 2022 was 8 calendar days. This is two days higher than <abbr title="quarter 2">Q2</abbr> of <abbr title="financial year ending">FYE</abbr> 2021.</p>

<h3>To note</h3>

<p>41. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics do not include figures for the London Borough of Hackney Council from October 2020, because of a cyber-attack suffered by the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> impacting data provision and, more recently, data quality. Therefore, speed of processing figures for Hackney will be omitted in line with our standard approach for handling missing data or data with quality concerns. Analysis for Hackney using historical data shows that this is likely to affect volumes of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims by 1% at GB level and around 5% at regional (London) level. The GB and regional level speed of processing figures are not impacted by the omission of Hackney data. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> speed of processing statistics do not include new claims data for Tandridge District Council for September 2021 and Oxford City Council for August and September 2021. These <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> had IT system upgrades and this impacted data provision and data quality. The omission of this data is also in line with our standard approach for handling missing data and data with concerns around quality.</p>

<p>42. The data in this release should be seen in context with operational emergency measures, policy changes and easements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Understanding changes to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> service delivery</h2>

<p>43. Since the start of the pandemic, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> has fully recognised how <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have reacted at pace to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and shown tremendous resilience in adapting and transforming the services they provide.</p>

<p>44. We are now keen to gain a better understanding of the innovations <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> have made during this time in delivering services across your authorities. Specifically, <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> would like to learn more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>digitalisation</li>
  <li>automation</li>
  <li>service re-designs or transformation initiatives</li>
  <li>use of improved data flows</li>
  <li>any other types of IT innovations</li>
</ul>

<p>45. <abbr title="Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery">LA-PED</abbr> would also like to understand how we can widen our support to <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> with any of the above as well as facilitate good practice sharing across all <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>. Therefore, during your regular liaison calls, our Performance Relationship Managers (<abbr title="Performance Relationship Managers">PRM</abbr>) may ask you about some of the above topics.</p>

<p>46. Alternatively, if you would like to tell us about any council-wide changes your <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> has made before your next <abbr title="Performance Relationship Managers">PRM</abbr>, call you can send any contributions to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:lawelfare.pdtprm@dwp.gov.uk">lawelfare.pdtprm@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>
