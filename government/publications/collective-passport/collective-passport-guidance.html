<h2>Collective passports</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff about collective passports, the types of collective passports we offer, the standards for a collective passport and what countries accept a collective passport</p>

<p>Collective (or group) passports are a way for an organised group of young people, (under 18 years old) to travel to other countries for educational or cultural purposes.</p>

<p>A collective passport is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>issued as an A4 sized 4-page document that’s embossed (stamped) and individually numbered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supported by a photo identity cards for each young person named on the collective passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot guarantee a country will accept a collective passport. It’s up to the country the group is travelling to whether they’ll accept a collective passport and this could change at any time. If possible, young people should travel on their own passports.</p>

<p>Customers must allow a minimum of 6 weeks when applying for a collective passport.</p>

<h3>Collective passport: page 1</h3>

<p>The front page (page 1) shows the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>name of the party</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>number of young people travelling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>destination country and the names of any other countries the group will be travelling through</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>validity period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>group leader details and deputy group leader details (if there are any)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collective passport: page 2</h3>

<p>Page 2 has the full list of all the young people travelling on the collective passport.</p>

<p>You, the examiner, must add an HM Passport Office date stamp, under the last name on the party list to show the date we issued the collective passport.</p>

<h3>Collective passport: page 3</h3>

<p>You (the examination support clerk) must add a stamp to show the date we issued the collective passport.</p>

<p>You, the examiner, must sign page 3.</p>

<h3>Collective passport: page 4</h3>

<p>The back page (page 4) is blank.</p>

<h3>Standard for a collective passport</h3>

<p>Collective passports are for British nationals only. There are 6 different types of British nationality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-citizenship">British citizen</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-overseas-territories-citizen">British overseas territories citizen</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-overseas-citizen">British overseas citizen</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-subject">British subject</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-national-overseas">British national (overseas)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality/british-protected-person">British protected person</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All members in a collective passport, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be British nationals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reside in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be under 18 years of age at the end of the trip (when they return to the UK)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Collective passports are not for families but for approved groups travelling for education or cultural reasons. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>schools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scouts and guides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sixth form college</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>military cadets (if all members of the party are under the age of 18)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recognised youth organisations and clubs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. You, the examiner, must check each group to confirm if they can apply for a collective passport.</p>

<h4>Number of people who can travel on a collective passport</h4>

<p>A collective passport can hold between 5 and 50 young people.</p>

<p>Although a collective passport can hold up to 50 young people, if there’s more than 25, we’ll split the group into equal sizes and create a collective passport for each group (this is in line with Border Force guidance). If there’s more than 25 young people on the application, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>split the group into equal sizes and create a collective passport for each group</p>

    <ul>
      <li>make sure there are no more than 25 young people on 1 collective passport</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>put the same group leader on each collective passport (if there is only 1 group leader)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If there’s only 5 young people on the application, you must tell the group leader that if 1 person withdraws from the trip, the collective passport will be invalid</p>

<h4>Group leaders</h4>

<p>A collective passport must include a group leader and can also include a deputy leader. If a group leader is unable to travel, the collective passport will be invalid for travel if there’s no deputy leader named on the passport. However, if the collective passport names a deputy, they can take over as the leader.</p>

<p>Group leaders and deputies must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be at least 21 years old</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a fully valid British citizen passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travel with the party</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Deputy leaders</h4>

<p>It is not mandatory to include a deputy leader. However, if an organisation chooses not to have a deputy, we must explain the risks to them.</p>

<h3>Applications from charities</h3>

<p>If a charity applies for a collective passport, you must ask for a letter from the director (or similar person) to confirm the charity is registered (unless you already have it).</p>

<p>If you get a letter to confirm the charity is registered, you must continue with the collective application (in line with this guidance).</p>

<p>If you do not get a letter to confirm the charity is registered or the charity tell you they are not registered, you must refer the application to the collective team manager. The collective team manager must decide if you can accept the application, taking in to account any safeguarding (protection) or vulnerability concerns.</p>

<h3>Types of collective passports</h3>

<p>There are 2 types of collective passports,</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an EACP, Council of Europe passport for travel to countries who signed up to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168006b644" rel="external">1962 Treaty - European Agreement on Travel by Young Persons on Collective Passports between the Member Countries of the Council of Europe</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an XCP, non Council of Europe collective passport for countries who did not sign up to the treaty</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The countries who signed up to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168006b644" rel="external">1962 Treaty - European Agreement on Travel by Young Persons on Collective Passports between the Member Countries of the Council of Europe</a> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Belgium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Denmark</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>France</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greece</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iceland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ireland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Italy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liechtenstein</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Luxembourg</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malta</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Netherlands</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Norway</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Portugal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sweden</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switzerland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Republic of North Macedonia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turkey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The United Kingdom (signature also covered Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and Gibraltar)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However since signing the Treaty some countries have changed their position on collective passports, you must check the requirements for individual countries.</p>

<h3>Requirements for individual countries</h3>

<p>There are some countries that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Countries_who_confirmed">have confirmed they will they accept collective passports</a> (although this may change at short notice)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Countries_who_we">may accept collective passports</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Countries may change their entry requirements at any time, including if they’ll accept a collective passport. Before applying for a collective passport, group leaders must check the specific requirements of the country (or countries) they are travelling to.</p>

<h4>Confirmed countries that accept collective passports</h4>

<p>This table shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the countries that have confirmed they will accept a collective passport</li>

<p>If we have not yet issued a collective passport and the group is travelling to (or through) 1 of these countries, you must:</p>

<p>1. Contact the group leader by phone, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell them about the possible problems they may have</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recommend each person travels on their own passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the country’s embassy before travelling to ask for confirmation if they will accept the collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take any confirmation an embassy gives that confirms the country will accept a collective passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Send a letter to confirm the situation.</p>

<h3>If someone in a group needs their own individual passport</h3>

<p>If a group travels to a country that does not (or may not) accept a collective passport, we recommend the group use their own individual passports (if they have one).</p>

<p>If an organisation confirms they still want to use the collective passport or there’s not enough time for members of the group to their own individual passport, the organisation must send a written and signed statement to us, to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that HM Passport Office advised them they may not be able to enter the country using a collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they take full responsibility for travelling</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a group decides to travel on their own passports but a group member does not have one, they must apply for one (and pay the correct fee). If their date of travel is more than 7 days away but less than 14 days away, they can apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the Fast Track service and we will refund the service element of the fee, if we do not already have an application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a free upgrade, if we’ve already got their application and have had it for more than 5 days - a senior executive officer may exceptionally accept an upgrade if we’ve had the application less than 5 days, if both of the following apply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>we have evidence from the organisation to show their travel arrangements</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>there’s no safeguarding (protection) or vulnerability concerns</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot issue a collective passport or the organisation no longer wants it, you must issue a refund.</p>

<h4>Collective passports for cruises</h4>

<p>You, the collective examiner, must check the countries the cruise will visit on the itinerary accept collective passports.</p>

<h3>Countries that do not accept a collective passport</h3>

<p>The following countries have confirmed they will not accept collective passports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

<p>If the group are travelling to (or through) any of these countries, you must:</p>

<p>1. Contact the group leader by phone, to tell them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you will withdraw the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>each person on the party list must travel on their own passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Send a letter to confirm the situation.</p>

<h3>If we are unsure a country will accept collective passports</h3>

<p>You may get a collective passport application for a group travelling to a country that we do not know will accept a collective passport. These are countries not included in our list, that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have <a class="govuk-link" href="#Confirmed_countries_who">confirmed they will accept a collective passport</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Countries_we_know">may accept a collective passport</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do <a class="govuk-link" href="#Countries_that_do">not accept a collective passport</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, you, the collective passport examiner, must refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/travel-documents-issued-third-countries-and-territorial-entities-part-i_en" rel="external">the European Commission definitive list of countries in the Schengen area</a> that accept collective passports (UK collective passports can be found on line 2,854 of the document).</p>

<p>If you find any country changes in the European Commission definitive list that are not reflected in this guidance, you must:</p>

<p>1. Accept this information.</p>

<p>2. Inform the group leader (including any requirements for that country).</p>

<p>3. Email Guidance &amp; Quality, Operating Standards with the information so they can update this guidance.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the information in the European Commission definitive list or are still unsure whether a country will accept or not accept a collective passport, you must ask the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>group leader to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>contact the correct authority in the country they are travelling to, to check if they will accept a collective passport</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>check visa requirements with the country’s embassy or consulate in the UK, before they travel</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organisation applying for a collective passport must send us a written and signed statement confirming they are travelling at their own risk</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How we add collective applications to the database</h2>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Collective_passport_applications:">print and post</a> a copy of the application, signed by the group leader (and deputy if they’ve named one) to the collective team</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the application is sent in Microsoft Word format</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Collective passport application does not meet requirements</h4>

<p>If an application does not meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Requirements_for_electronic">requirements</a>, you (the examination support clerk) must pass the application to a collective examiner, who must contact the organisation and discuss the issue. If the date of travel is within 2 weeks see: <a class="govuk-link" href="#Urgent__">urgent applications</a>.</p>

<h4>Collective passport application meets the requirements</h4>

<p>You, the examination support clerk, must save an electronic copy of the application to print folder, (in the Collective team file structure) using the format: organisation, date of travel, number of young people (for example: ‘Durham Rainbows14-05-17 23kids’).</p>

<p>If we receive an email saying the group is sending a change to the application, you must save the file with ‘AMENDED’ at the end (for example: ‘Durham Rainbows14-05-17 23AMENDED’).</p>

<h4>Group emails</h4>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not delete the original email, as we must keep it for audit reasons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>save the email showing who sent the application in the Group emails folder (in the Collective team file structure)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>move the email from the collective inbox to the completed email folder in the folder named the month after the date of travel (for example, if the date of travel was 16 February, you would move the email to the March completed email folder)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collective passport applications: post</h3>

<p>We will accept hand-written and printed paper collective passport application forms. The organisation must type and email the party list to us.</p>

<p>Paper applications must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an <a class="govuk-link" href="#Authorising_letter_requirements">authorising letter</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/collective-group-passports/supporting-documents">collective passport nationality questionnaire and parental consent form</a> for each young person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 identical photos for each young person listed on the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a photo declaration form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a fee of £39, payable by cheque or card mandate (the fee may be more if it includes special delivery)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Requirements for paper collective applications</h4>

<p>You, the examination support clerk, must check the paper application to make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>each of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Countries_which_accept">countries listed</a> accepts a collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the application includes a party list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date of travel is not urgent (within 2 weeks)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 50 young people on the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the application does not meet all the requirements, you must pass the application to a collective examiner to contact the organisation and discuss the issue.</p>

<h4>How to create a hard copy file</h4>

<p>If the application is correct, you, the examination support clerk must create a hard copy file. The long jacket (the cover for the collective application) must include the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>organisation name (this must match the details on the authorising letter)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>if more than 1 group is in the party, the name must be followed with the word ‘party’</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date you created the file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>finance date (the date we received payment)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date of departure from the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payment type and amount (for example, CHQ £39)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You, the collective examiner, must not add the number of young people to the long jacket until you complete the examination, as this might change during the application process.</p>

<h3>How to add a collective passport application to the system</h3>

<p>When you, the examination support clerk, have completed all checks, you must add the application to the collective database (held in the Collective team file structure) This will generate a collective passport number that you must add to the long jacket. The status on the database must show, ‘finance’.</p>

<p>When you add the collective passport number to the long jacket, you must print an acknowledgement letter.</p>

<h3>How to record payments for collective passports</h3>

<p>You, the examination support clerk, must record payment details on an electronic copy of the finance form for every collective passport application. You must use individual sheets for the different payment types you receive each day (for example, cheque, credit or debit card mandate).</p>

<h4>If an application contains cash</h4>

<p>You must immediately alert the collective team manager (or other member of the team) if an application contains cash. You must:</p>

<p>1. Record it on the finance form (to support an audit of payment handling).</p>

<p>2. Hand it to the finance team.</p>

<p>For each entry, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>record full details for each line of payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>total the value of fees for all collective passport applications on that day, checking it’s correct</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add the date and number of applications in the boxes provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>save an electronic copy in the finance invoices folder (in the team file structure) using the date and method of payment (for example, 01 JAN cheque)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add a sheet number if there is more than 1 method of payment on that date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>print a copy of the finance form, sign it and ask the collective team manager (or collective examiner if a manager is not available) to countersign the form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hand the printed copy of the form and payments to the finance team</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to examine a collective passport application</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff how to examine a collective passport application.</p>

<p>We deal with collective passports differently to that of the standard British passport. However, some of the checks we do are the same. Like any other passport application, if you have fraud, safeguarding (child protection) or vulnerability concerns, you must refer the application to the Counter Fraud team (CFT).</p>

<h3>How to find an application on the collective database</h3>

<p>You, the collective examiner, must search the collective database to check the collective passport number matches the number on the long jacket (the cover for the collective application). If it is correct, you must change the status on the database to Pending and write your name on the long jacket.</p>

<h3>How to find the electronic party list</h3>

<p>You must search for the electronic application in the to print folder (in the team file structure), making sure it matches the paper application you are examining.</p>

<p>Before printing the party list, you must check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the full list is in upper case and Arial 8 font</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ‘country of birth’ (page 2) is changed from England, Scotland and Wales to UK</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>if ‘United Kingdom’ is written out in full, change it to UK</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if any other country aside from the UK is listed, you must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/geographical-names-and-information">UK government list</a> to check how to record the country name</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have aligned the cell centre left – you can do this by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>highlighting the entire party list</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>right clicking to format cells, alignment and horizontal drop down</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>clicking left to indent</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have corrected any spelling mistakes in the town and country columns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ‘date of birth’ column is in the same format throughout</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have removed any middle names (unless they are hyphenated)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>if there are young people with the same surname and first forename, you must leave in their middle names</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not receive an electronic copy, you can examine the hard copy (paper) form.</p>

<h3>How to find and print the authorising email</h3>

<p>You, the collective examiner, must find the authorising email in the Group emails folder by searching the party name. You must print a copy and place it inside the long jacket before you delete it from the folder.</p>

<p>If the group leader (or deputy leader) sent the email on the query sheet, tick the ‘list’ box. If a third party sent the email (not the leader or deputy leader) tick ‘no list’ on the query sheet.</p>

<h3>Collective passports: how to raise and resolve query sheets</h3>

<p>Every application must have a query sheet where you can record the checks you have done. You must update the query sheet when you raise and resolve queries.</p>

<p>When you raise a query, put a tick in the box to the right-hand side of the note. When you resolve it, put a tick in the box to the left-hand side.</p>

<h3>Collective passports: how to check the organisation</h3>

<p>You must complete an online check to make sure every organisation is genuine and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>do a check on each organisation, if more than 1 is listed on the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check online, using the name of the party</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visit their website to confirm the details in the authorising letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the contact details of the organisation match the details on the support letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the organisation logo (if it’s on the authorising letter) matches the logo on the website</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After you have confirmed the organisation, tick the online check box in the security check section of the query sheet.</p>

<p>If there are inconsistencies with your checks, you must note them on the query sheet and try to resolve them with the organisation.</p>

<p>You must add any school holidays that will take place before the trip to the top of the long jacket to support contact.</p>

<h3>Authorising letter requirements for collective passports</h3>

<p>Every application must have an authorising letter. The covering letter must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be on the organisation’s letter head</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that all the young people are members of the organisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the organisation supports the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have an original signature (not scanned or photocopied)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include a signature from someone other than the group leader (or deputy)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the person must hold an acceptable position within the organisation (for example, a chair or director of a charity)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include details of the group leader or deputy leader’s children who are joining the party but do not attend the organisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm details of the trip, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>destination</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>departure and return dates</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>name and full address of the organisation</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm it is an authorised journey and the correct approval was given, for example, by a:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>board of governors</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>local authority</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>national headquarters</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the application includes more than 1 organisation, you must have a separate letter from each organisation.</p>

<h3>Collective passport application form checks: page 1</h3>

<p>Each collective application must include an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/collective-passport-application">application form</a> that you must check against the authorising letter and other supporting information.</p>

<h4>Sections 1 to 7</h4>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check that sections 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 on the application form agree with the details in the covering letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>note any inconsistencies on the query sheet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask for a new covering letter (signed by the same person) if the covering letter and application have different travel dates</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The countries in section 3, 4 and 5 must all <a class="govuk-link" href="#Requirements_for_individual">accept collective passports</a>.</p>

<h4>How to ask for a declaration</h4>

<p>If a party is travelling to a country that has not confirmed they accept collective passports, you must ask them for a declaration (signed by the person who has signed the authorising letter). The declaration must confirm the party accepts the risk of travelling on a collective passport.</p>

<h4>Sections 8 and 9</h4>

<p>All parties must fill in section 8. If the answer to section 8 is, ‘yes’, they must also fill in section 9. You must then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>add the group leader’s address abroad on the collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attach a ‘leaders address abroad’ label to the top of the long jacket</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Section 10</h4>

<p>All parties must fill in section 10. If there are inconsistencies between the organisation’s address on section 10 and the authorising letter, you must write it in red on the application form.</p>

<p>If the application is from a school, college or an academy, you must return the collective passport to the group leader at the school address, regardless of the address they entered in section 10.</p>

<p>We can send collective passports to the group leader’s home address without extra authorisation for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>football clubs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scouts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brownies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>youth clubs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Urgent collective passport applications</h4>

<p>If we already have an application and the organisation needs the collective passport urgently (as the date of travel is within 2 weeks), you may have to post the collective passport to the group leader’s home address.</p>

<p>To do this, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask for a letter on organisation headed paper confirming the address details are the same as the details on the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the same person who signed the authorisation letter has signed the new letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cross reference the signature on the new letter making sure it is the same as the original signature for the person on file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check the group leader’s address online to confirm it is correct (for example, using Royal Mail postcode finder or 192.com)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Sections 11 and 12</h4>

<p>Check sections 11 and 12 (group leader and deputy) against our individual passport records on Main Index (MI). You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the fields on the application match the details on MI exactly, including middle names</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check their passports have 6 months validity at the end of the trip - if not you must inform the group leader or deputy leader that they will need to renew their passport)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must carry out a watchlist check on the group leader and deputy to make sure there’s no reasons why we cannot issue a collective passport. If the watchlist checks are not clear, you must refer the application to the collective team manager.</p>

<p>You must correct in red pen any details that are different on the form. For example, you must add a middle name if it’s on MI but not on the application form. You must check any date of birth differences with the group leader.</p>

<h4>Sections 13 and 14</h4>

<p>Group leaders and deputy leaders must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid British citizen passport with at least 6 months of validity left at the date of return to the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be at least 21 years old</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live in the UK</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The group leader and deputy leader (if the group lists one on the application) must complete sections 13 and 14. They must include their personal address and contact numbers to support urgent contact and to make sure they live in the UK.</p>

<h4>Section 15</h4>

<p>Section 15 must include original signatures from the group leader and deputy leader (if the group has listed one). You must ask for a new application form, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are no signatures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the signatures are photocopies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the signatures are scanned images</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collective passport application form: page 2</h3>

<p>The party list (page 2 of the hard copy application) is the same as the one sent by the organisation as part of the electronic copy of the application.</p>

<h4>Actions you must complete against page 2</h4>

<p>When dealing with page 2 of the application, you must:</p>

<p>1. Sort the party list in alphabetical order by surname (you must remove middle names, unless there is more than 1 young person with the same first and last name).</p>

<p>2. Check each <a class="govuk-link" href="#Examining_the_Collective">Collective Passport Nationality Questionnaire (CPNQ)</a> and photo against the list (note any differences on the query sheet).</p>

<p>3. Show town and country of birth in full.</p>

<p>4. Check the nationality of all the young people (you may check UKVI systems to confirm a young person’s (or their parent’s) immigration status to confirm nationality.</p>

<p>5. Check all young people will be under 18 years old when they return to the UK.</p>

<p>6. Show town of residence in full:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if residences are not in the same geographical area, it could show 2 or more organisations making up the party (check the details with the organisation).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Photos for collective passport applications</h3>

<p>Applications must include 2 identical passport sized photos for each young person. All photos must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>recent (taken in the last 12 months)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear, showing the full face</p>
  </li>

    <p>free from copyright (stamp across image)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On the back of 1 photo there must be the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>young person’s first name and surname</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>signature of the group leader named on the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The second photo must be blank.</p>

<p>The group leader must send a signed Photograph Declaration form.</p>

<p>You must check the details against the application form and the CPNQ and note any inconsistencies on the query sheet.</p>

<h3>How to make a photocard for collective passports</h3>

<p>Every young person named on the application must have a photocard, regardless of age or countries they will visit. You must note any inconsistencies between the photocard, party list and CPNQ on the query sheet.</p>

<p>To make a photocard, you must:</p>

<p>1. Glue the blank photo on the photocard</p>

<p>2. Attach the signed photo to the photocard with a paperclip.</p>

<p>3. Write the young person’s surname and first forename in capital letters and black ink on the inside of the photocard</p>

<ul>
  <li>include any middle names if there are young people with the same surname and first forename</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Stamp, ‘the holder is not required to sign’ under the signature of the holder, if a young person is not able to sign the photocard.</p>

<h3>How to examine the CPNQ</h3>

<p>You must get a CPNQ (Collective Passport Nationality Questionnaire) for every young person named on the application.</p>

<h4>Who can sign a CPNQ</h4>

<p>The CPNQ must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hand-written in ink</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include an original signature</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>signed by someone with parental responsibility for the young person</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must ask for a new CPNQ, if the signature is missing or in digital format (scanned or photocopied). If a carer or guardian signs the form, you must ask them for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>letter explaining why they are signing in place of someone with parental responsibility (the letter must meet the requirements in line with the authorisation and consent guidance)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new form signed by someone with parental responsibility</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to confirm a young person’s nationality</h4>

<p>A British passport number confirms a young person’s nationality. You must check the passport number on the form matches the details on Main Index (MI).</p>

<p>If the name on MI does not match the name on the collective application, you must check if there has been a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Collective_passport:_child">child change of name</a>.</p>

<p>If there is no passport number for the child on the CPNQ, you must:</p>

<p>1. Check the rest of the form to confirm they have a claim</p>

<p>2. Refer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Collective_passports:_young">collective passports: young person born in the United Kingdom</a> (if the young person was born in the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Collective_passports:_young_1">collective passports: young person not born in the United Kingdom</a> (if the young person was not born in the UK)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Collective passports: young person born in the UK</h4>

<p>If, at the time the young person was born, one of their parents was a British citizen other than by descent (OTBD), they can remain on the collective passport. You can check if a child’s parent was a British citizen OTBD using Main Index (MI) (if parents provide their passport number).</p>

<p>If, at the time the young person was born, neither of their parents was a British citizen, you must check the back of the CPNQ to see if the parents have restrictions on their stay in the UK. You may check if they have restrictions using the UKVI system or you can ask them for evidence they do not have restrictions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a Home Office letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photocopy of stamps in the parent’s passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photocopy of a naturalisation or registration certificate for the young person (or parent)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If a photocopy is received, you must check the details on the UKVI systems to make sure the details match what is on the copies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are no restrictions, the young person can remain on the collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>were restrictions in place, you must refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Collective_passports:_no">collective passports: no claim to British nationality</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Collective passports: young person not born in the UK</h4>

<p>If the young person has a parent who was a British citizen OTBD at the time of the young person’s birth, they have a claim to British nationality and may remain on the collective passport.</p>

<p>For a young person born abroad who is a British national, you must:</p>

<p>1. Write ‘BC’ at the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>end of their line on the party list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>top of the CPNQ form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Place the BC CPNQ forms behind the ‘Not BC’ forms inside the long jacket.</p>

<p>If the young person has no claim to British nationality, you must refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Collective_passports:_no">collective passports: no claim to British nationality</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unsure if the young person has a nationality claim, you must:</p>

<p>1. Ask the collective team manager to make a final decision.</p>

<p>2. Ask the group leader for evidence to confirm nationality (if the collective’s team manager confirms there may be a claim). Evidence can include a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Home Office letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photocopy of a parent’s naturalisation or registration certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photocopy of stamps in the parents’ passports</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Collective passports: no claim to British nationality</h4>

<p>If a young person does not have a claim to British nationality, you must remove them from the collective passport. You must change the party list in red pen, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>putting a line through the young person’s details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>writing ‘not BC’ at the end of their line</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must write ‘not BC’ in red at the top of the CPNQ and put the form at the front of the CPNQ inside the long jacket. You must:</p>

<p>1. Still prepare the photocard.</p>

<p>2. Cancel it by cutting the top corners and stamping cancelled across the card (not over the name).</p>

<p>3. Update the query sheet to confirm the names of any young person we removed as not ‘BC’.</p>

<p>4. Tell the group leader in writing (by letter or email) of any young person not eligible to be included and the reason.</p>

<p>A young person can still travel with the group using their own passport. If they do not already hold a passport, tell the group leader to contact the consulate or High Commission in the UK that deals with their parents’ citizenship.</p>

<h4>Collective passports: young person is stateless or a refugee</h4>

<p>You, the collective examiner, must not include any young person who is stateless or a refugee on a collective passport. You must remove these young people from the party list.</p>

<h3>How to update the electronic copy of the party list</h3>

<p>After you examine all documents, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>update the electronic copy (saved in the To Print folder) with any changes you’ve made (marked in red) on the hard copy party list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add a handwritten case note to the file, recording the reason for deleting the young person from the collective passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collective passports: despatch letter</h3>

<p>You must prepare the correct despatch letter, based on the country the group is travelling to. You must include <a class="govuk-link" href="#Countries_which_accept">any special requirements</a> the organisation needs to be aware of. If you include special requirements (for example, visa requirements in a letter) you must print and keep a copy of the letter for the file.</p>

<p>If you are sending the collective passport by special delivery, you must put a special delivery label inside the long jacket with the despatch letter.</p>

<h3>Collective passports: counter collection</h3>

<p>If the customer is collecting the collective passport, you must write at the top of the long jacket in red pen, ‘COUNTER COLLECTION’.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fill in a counter collection form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the customer by phone to confirm the collective passport is ready for collection and confirm when they will be collecting it</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you must contact the counter manager, if they want to collect when there is no collective examiner available (for example, on a Saturday)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>place the form at the front of the file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the person collecting the collective passport they must sign the form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep the form on file, until we destroy it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The person collecting the collective passport must bring photo identification. You must note (on the counter collection form) what photo identification the person collecting the passport brought.</p>

<p>If the person collecting is not the group leader or deputy leader, they must have a letter from the organisation on headed paper. The letter must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a signature from the person who signed the authorising letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give permission for the person to collect the collective passport (it must state the person’s full name)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The organisation can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>email the letter before collecting the passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bring it when collecting</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must check the signature matches the one on the authorising letter. You must sign and date the counter collection form when you hand over the passport.</p>

<p>You must update the despatch date on the system to show the date of collection. In the special delivery number section, type Collection. You must store the file with the despatched items for the same date.</p>

<h3>Collective passports: when the examination is complete</h3>

<p>When the examination is complete, you must update the long jacket of the paper application, to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>examiner name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>party name and their location (for example, ‘Broadland High School, Norwich’)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>collective passport type</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>number of young people</p>

  <li>
    <p>destination country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>countries to be visited during the trip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>countries travelled through</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date of departure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date of return</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>next action needed (for example, approve)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to print the collective passport</h3>

<p>To print the collective passport, you (the examination support clerk) must go to the templates folder and:</p>

<p>1. Select the correct template (for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Types_of_collective_1">euro or non-euro</a>).</p>

<p>2. Type the information from the front of the long jacket on page 1 of the template.</p>

<p>3. Scroll to the Members of the Party page.</p>

<p>4. Use the electronic copy of the application to highlight the members of the party section.</p>

<p>5. Copy the data and paste on the collective passport using ‘overwrite cells’</p>

<p>6. Check you have copied the data in the correct sections, making sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>font is Arial, size 8</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all in capitals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cell alignment is centre left</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>7. Include the group leader’s address abroad in the observation section if there is a label on the outside of the long jacket</p>

<p>8. Save the collective passport in folder ‘01 printed’, (in the team file structure) using the 6 digit collective passport number (on the front of the long jacket), followed by the return date of travel (for example, 123456 19-11-19)</p>

<p>9. Print the collective passport in colour on A3 cream paper in booklet format</p>

<p>10. Place the printed collective passport inside the file</p>

<p>11. Hand the file to the collective examiner who examined the application for checking and sign off</p>

<h3>How to approve a collective passport</h3>

<p>You, the collective examiner, must check every collective passport you examined before you approve it. You must check the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>information on the collective passport matches the information on the long jacket and application form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Supporting_letter_requirements">authorising letter</a> meets all requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>query sheet to make sure all checks are complete</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>address on the letter headed paper matches the address on section 10 of the application form and dispatch letter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Inside the collective passport, you must check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all text is in capitals, size 8, Arial font and cell aligned to the left</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>surnames are in alphabetical order (first letter only)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number of young people inside matches the number of young people on the front of the collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for obvious spelling mistakes to names, towns of birth, town of residence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the collective passport only includes towns and not counties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all young people will be under 18 years of age on the return date of travel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that any young person born abroad is a British citizen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that any young person removed as ‘Not BC’ is not a British citizen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have actioned the changes in red pen, on the printed electronic copy of the party list, on the printed collective passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must check <a class="govuk-link" href="#How_to_make">photocards meet all requirements</a> and the names on the photocards match the names on the collective passports.</p>

<p>You must check the despatch letter to make sure, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>address on the authorising letter matches the address on the despatch letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>examiner has used the correct letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>examiner has signed the despatch letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>letter confirms the young people who have been removed (if we have not already told the group leader)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>letter includes more instructions to the group leader (for example, visa requirements)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you complete all checks, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>use the HM Passport Office date stamp to stamp on the line below the last young person’s name, making sure no blank line is between the last name and the stamp</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sign page 3 of the collective passport</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>if there are 50 young people on the collective passport, it may not be possible to put a full date stamp under the last young person’s name – if this happens, you must:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>stamp as much of the date stamp as possible, under the last surname</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>put a full date stamp at the top of the same page, above the surname column</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to finish the collective passport application</h3>

<p>You must put the following in an envelope and seal it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>completed collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>copies for Border Forces</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extra copies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>photo cards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>despatch letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>child deletion form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When the collective passport is despatched, either 1st class Tracked Delivery or Special Delivery (if the customer paid for it), you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>note the date of despatch on the long jacket</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stamp it with a red despatch stamp</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>update the system with the despatch date and Tracked or Special Delivery number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep all applications in date of despatch order</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Security checks on collective passport applications</h3>

<p>Collective examiners must carry out security checks on 2% of collective passports each month. However, they must not carry out security checks on applications they dealt with.</p>

<p>When collective examiners carry out a security check, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fully examine the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>record the results on the Executive Office Collective Passport security check form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Random checks on collective passports ready for issue</h3>

<p>Collective team managers must carry out spot checks on collective passports that are complete and ready to despatch. This is to check the quality of the completed collective passport and photocards. The collective team manager must record the results on the PO1 Spotchecks Sheet for the correct month and year.</p>

<h3>What to do if a collective passport is lost or damaged</h3>

<p>If we lose a collective passport in the office or in the post, we must issue a replacement free of charge. If the organisation loses their collective passport, they must pay the full fee for a replacement.</p>

<p>Before we consider a free replacement, you must investigate how we sent the collective passport to the organisation (for example, was it first class Tracked or Special Delivery) and if the collective passport was received by the organisation.</p>

<p>If you need a replacement You must refer the application to the collective team manager. When the collective team manager approves the reissue, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reprint the collective passport from the system using the same number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>type DUP in the greyed-out box at the top of the collective passport template</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an organisation tells us they have damaged their collective passport, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>return it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include a covering letter explaining how the damage happened</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pay the full fee</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When we receive the information, you must reprint the collective passport using the same number.</p>

<p>If an organisation tells us they received the collective passport damaged, we can issue a replacement free of charge. The organisation must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>return the collective passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include a letter, explaining the extent of the damage when they received it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must refer the case to a collective team manager for authorisation to re-issue. Once it’s been approved, you must reprint the collective passport from the system using the same number. You must place the original collective passport in confidential waste.</p>

<p>If you need to replace any photocards, you can use the spare photos on file. You must make sure we keep a copy of the photos with the young person’s name on file.</p>

<p>When approving a change, the collective team manager must stamp the amended collective passport with the same date of the original collective passport.</p>

<h3>How to destroy collective passport application files</h3>

<p>You must keep files until the return date of travel has passed and then place them in confidential waste.</p>

<h3>Collective passport: child change of name</h3>

<p>If a child’s name on the application form is different to the one on their passport, birth certificate or naturalisation (or registration) certificate, you may use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Life Events Verification to confirm the details on short birth certificates issued in England and Wales (if the customer provides a English or Welsh short birth certificate)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the UKVI system to confirm details on naturalisation (or registration) certificates (if the customer provides a naturalisation (or registration certificate)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the names do not match, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>carry out watchlist checks on the names</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change the name to match the name on the identity documents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the group leader this is the name the child must travel in</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can only use a child’s new name, if we get signed permission from everyone with parental responsibility and either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the child’s current passport has expired</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the child never had a passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are adding a young person to the collective passport in a different name to that on their identity documents, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>update the party list to show the correct name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create a new photocard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add the change to the query sheet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell the group leader the young person will be travelling on the collective passport in their new name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check the names against the watchlist</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collective passports: children in care</h3>

<p>When we receive a Collective Passport Nationality Questionnaire (CPNQ) for a child in care, we need different information for collective passport purposes. It depends on the type of care order the child is under.</p>

<p>The 3 main types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>full care order</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>voluntary care order</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interim care order</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must check you have the correct consent for children in care.</p>

<h4>Full care order</h4>

<p>A foster carer or social worker must sign the CPNQ.</p>

<h4>Voluntary care order</h4>

<p>A parent must sign the CPNQ. If they are unable to sign the CPNQ, a social worker can sign. Social Services must confirm why the parent cannot sign the form.</p>

<h4>Interim care order</h4>

<p>A parent, foster carer or social worker can sign the CPNQ. We must have a copy of the court order, as this must be in force on the day we issue the collective passport.</p>

<p>The CPNQ must include the relationship to the child so we know who has signed the form.  A social service manager must confirm in writing on letter headed paper, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>section of the Children’s Act the child is under</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>destination</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>duration of the trip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>purpose of the proposed journey</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The same person must not sign the letter and the CPNQ. The signature of the manager must be on the letter and not signed on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Incomplete collective passport applications</h3>

<p>You must contact the group leader to ask questions or for more information to support the application. If they need to travel urgently, you must make all contact by phone first and then send an email. All correspondence must confirm the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>name of the group leader</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>collective passport reference number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>trip destination</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>departure date</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must print 2 copies of the letter: 1 for despatch, 1 to keep on file. If you contact the group leader by email, you only need to print 1 copy for the file.</p>

<h3>How to withdraw a collective passport application</h3>

<p>If an organisation wants to withdraw an application, they must send a letter signed by the same person who signed the original authorising letter.</p>

<p>When you (the collectives examiner) receive the letter, you must:</p>

<p>1. Write ‘withdrawn’ on the long jacket in red ink</p>

<p>2. Update the spreadsheet with the word ‘Withdrawn’</p>

<p>3. Store the withdrawn application form with any photocards and documentation in ‘despatch work’, under the date withdrawn</p>

<p>4. Keep the application until the intended travel date has passed</p>

<h2>Collective passport: how to make a change</h2>

<p>This section tells Her Majesty’s Passport Office staff how to make a change to a collective passport application, including changes to the group, group leader or deputy leader, changes to travel dates or changes to itinerates.</p>

<p>Some organisations may want to make a change to their collective passport, for example, if someone needs adding or removing from the passport or because the travel dates have changed. If you need to make changes and the date of travel is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in the next 2 weeks, you must ask a collective team manager to approve the change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more than 2 weeks away, you do not need approval from a collective team manager</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to change the group leader</h3>

<p>How we change the group leader will depend on if we’ve issued the collective passport.</p>

<h4>If we have not issued the collective passport</h4>

<p>The replacement group leader must complete a declaration new leader form. The person who supported the original application must sign the form.</p>

<p>You must change the new group leader’s details on page 1 of the application form and put the declaration form behind the application form in the file.</p>

<h4>If we have issued the collective passport</h4>

<p>You must ask the organisation to return the collective passport with a declaration new leader form. The person who authorised the original application must sign the form. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>change page 1 of the saved collective passport form to show the new details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>print and despatch the new collective passport when you change the document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the organisation to check if the previous group leader signed the photocards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask the organisation to return any signed cards so we can produce new ones</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the organisation does not need to return unsigned cards as the new group leader can sign these</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to change or add a deputy leader</h3>

<p>The new deputy leader must complete a declaration new deputy leader form (see: <a class="govuk-link" href="#How_to_change">changing the party leader</a>).</p>

<h3>How to add a young person to a collective passport</h3>

<p>If an organisation asks you to add a young person to a collective passport. The organisation must send us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Examining_the_nationality">Collective Passport Nationality Questionnaire</a> form for the new young person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a photo declaration form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 photos</p>
