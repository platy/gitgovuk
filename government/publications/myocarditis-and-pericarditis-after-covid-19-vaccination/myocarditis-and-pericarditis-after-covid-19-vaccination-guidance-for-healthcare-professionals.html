<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), in partnership with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcgp.org.uk/" rel="external">Royal College of General Practitioners (<abbr title="Royal College of General Practitioners">RCGP</abbr>)</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rcem.ac.uk/" rel="external">Royal College of Emergency Medicine (<abbr title="Royal College of Emergency Medicine">RCEM</abbr>)</a>, has produced this clinical guidance to support the detection and management of clinical cases of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) vaccination.</p>

<p>It is a living document and will be reviewed and updated as further data becomes available.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Background to myocarditis and pericarditis after <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination and guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this is a very rare condition following vaccination (see the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">weekly summary</a> for the latest data)</li>
  <li>most patients who develop symptoms do so within a week of vaccination</li>
  <li>patients who develop symptoms have usually been vaccinated with a <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna)</li>
  <li>myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is usually mild or stable and patients typically recover fully without medical treatment</li>
  <li>
    <p>myocarditis – a very small number of those with this condition have been admitted to hospital. In 2 studies from the US <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, significant left ventricular (<abbr title="left ventricular">LV</abbr>) fibrosis has been described in a high percentage of those children admitted to hospital, with a small percentage of these having non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (<abbr title="ventricular tachycardia">VT</abbr>)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>no long-term follow-up data is available yet on hospitalised patients</li>
      <li>diagnosis of myocarditis and pericarditis should follow published international guidelines</li>
      <li>the majority of cases appear to be mild and self-limiting; any acutely ill or unstable patients should be referred to hospital directly</li>
      <li>the long-term consequences of this condition secondary to vaccination are yet unknown, so any screening recommendations need to be balanced against the frequency and severity of the disease with the aim to prevent complications, in particular of myocarditis (arrhythmias, long term myocardial damage or heart failure)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Epidemiology</h2>

<p>Myocarditis and pericarditis are both inflammatory conditions of the heart. The incidence of myocarditis is difficult to ascertain as most cases are mild and are often not well investigated. In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.140.suppl_1.11463" rel="external">one study from the UK</a>, it was estimated that between 1998 and 2017, there were 36.5 per 100,000 NHS admissions with myocarditis, with the numbers increasing each year since 2004. In 2017, it was estimated that there were about 2,000 hospital admissions for myocarditis.</p>

<p>Overall, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/4/603" rel="external">two-thirds of myocarditis cases were in men</a>, and men were significantly younger (median age 33) compared to women. The most common type of myocarditis is an acute lymphocytic myocarditis, often caused by viral infection.</p>

<p>Pericarditis is a more benign condition and responds to treatment with anti-inflammatory medical treatment. In most cases, it has no long-term sequelae if treated promptly, but it can reoccur.</p>

<h2>Post-<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination</h2>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting">Reports of myocarditis and pericarditis</a> following vaccination with <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines have been received by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>As of 16 February 2022, there have been 721 reports of myocarditis and 483 reports of pericarditis following the use of the Pfizer vaccine. There have been 206 reports of myocarditis and 115 reports of pericarditis following the use of the Moderna vaccine. Some cases have been reported following the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but given the extensive use of AstraZeneca in the UK, these are thought to reflect the expected background incidence rate of myocarditis and pericarditis conditions.</p>

<p>As of 16 February 2022, the overall reporting rate across all age groups for myocarditis following vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine was 9 reports per million doses; for pericarditis, it was 6 reports per million doses. For Moderna, the overall reporting rate for myocarditis was 17 reports per million doses; for pericarditis, it was 10 reports per million doses.</p>

<p>In those aged under 18 years, the reported rate for heart inflammation (myocarditis and pericarditis) was 13 per million first doses and 11 per million second doses of the Pfizer vaccine; these are lower than the reporting rates seen in young adults. The Pfizer <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine is recommended for use in this age group.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Yellow Card data cannot be used to compare the safety profile of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines as many factors can influence reporting.</p>

<h2>Recommendations in paediatric patients in the context of recent <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination (within 10 days)</h2>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>If the patient is acutely unwell or unstable, has concerning features or if you have clinical concern, then they should be discussed with the emergency department (<abbr title="emergency department">ED</abbr>) or medical team and referred to hospital for further investigation.</p>

<p>Suspected cases should be examined by a doctor or nurse practitioner.</p>

<p>Concerning features that may require further investigation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significant chest pain (new onset and unexplained) – it can be difficult for children to localise chest pain</li>
  <li>tachycardia or tachypnoea</li>
  <li>dyspnoea (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>palpitations (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>dizziness or syncope (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>general clinical concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Where appropriate the patient should be seen face to face and this assessment should include their vital signs.</p>

<p>Dependent upon the assessment and findings, clinical judgement should be used to determine whether myocarditis or pericarditis remains a potential diagnosis of concern.</p>

<p>Where concern or doubt remains or there are findings that suggest an emergency assessment is required, then a discussion should take place with local paediatric services as to the most appropriate place and time for a further assessment to be made.</p>

<p>Clinicians should ensure they communicate with the young person or their family or carers that the condition is very rare, usually mild, often self-remitting and that long-term consequences are as yet unknown.</p>

<p>If patients have mild symptoms, they do not require a referral to secondary care at this point.</p>

<h3>Investigations</h3>
<p>Hospital investigations should follow local myocarditis or pericarditis guidelines with the involvement of the regional paediatric cardiology team.</p>

<p>If there is a suspicion of myocarditis or pericarditis, initial investigations should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>12 lead electrocardiogram (<abbr title="electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>)</li>
  <li>inflammatory blood markers (C-reactive protein (<abbr title="C-reactive protein">CRP</abbr>), full blood count (<abbr title="full blood count">FBC</abbr>) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (<abbr title="erythrocyte sedimentation rate">ESR</abbr>))</li>
  <li>Troponin</li>
</ul>

<p>If abnormal <abbr title="electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr> or Troponin, discuss with the paediatric cardiology team for further management plan, including cardiac imaging (echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (<abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr>)) and rhythm monitoring (24h Holter, stress <abbr title="electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>).</p>

<p>Further investigations and follow-up should be led by the regional paediatric cardiology team.</p>

<h2>Recommendations in adults 18 to 40 years of age in the context of recent <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination (within 10 days)</h2>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

<p>If the patient is acutely unwell or unstable, has concerning features or if you have clinical concern, then they should be discussed with the <abbr title="emergency department">ED</abbr> or medical team, and referred to hospital for further investigation.</p>

<p>Where appropriate the patient should be seen face to face and the assessment should include their vital signs.</p>

<p>Suspected cases should be examined by a doctor or nurse practitioner.</p>

<p>Concerning features that may require a referral for further investigation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significant chest pain (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>tachycardia or tachypnoea</li>
  <li>dyspnoea (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>palpitations (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>dizziness or syncope (new onset and unexplained)</li>
  <li>general clinical concern</li>
</ul>

<p>If patients have mild symptoms, they do not require a referral to secondary care at this point.</p>

<p>Dependent upon the assessment and findings, clinical judgement should be used to determine if myocarditis or pericarditis remains a potential diagnosis of concern.</p>

<h3>Investigations in secondary care</h3>

<p>If there is a suspicion of myocarditis or pericarditis, the initial investigations should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>12 lead <abbr title="electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>
</li>
  <li>inflammatory blood markers (<abbr title="C-reactive protein">CRP</abbr>, <abbr title="full blood count">FBC</abbr> and <abbr title="erythrocyte sedimentation rate">ESR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Troponin</li>
</ul>

<p>If abnormal <abbr title="electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr> or troponin, discuss with the cardiology team for further management plan, which might include cardiac imaging (Echocardiogram, cardiac <abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr>) and rhythm monitoring (24h Holter, stress <abbr title="electrocardiogram">ECG</abbr>).</p>

<p>Further investigations and follow-up should be led by the regional cardiology team.</p>

<h2>Further follow-up</h2>
<p>Patients that did not require referral to hospital on initial presentation or have normal initial investigations do not require further follow-up.</p>

<p>All patients that did not require referral to hospital in initial presentation should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>given the following ‘safety netting’ advice: 
‘if symptoms persist or worsen within 5 days, then they should return to their GP for review’</li>
  <li>referred for further investigation if, when seen later, have concerning features including general clinical concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Patients requiring outpatient follow-up should be referred to cardiology and an assessment undertaken within 4 weeks.</p>

<h2>Further vaccination</h2>

<p>Patients that have been diagnosed with confirmed myocarditis following <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> infection or vaccination should be treated following published guidelines (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001001" rel="external">for children</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/34/33/2636/408735" rel="external">for adults</a>).</p>

<p>Cardiology follow up should include a review 8 weeks after their diagnosis to assess their eligibility for further vaccinations.  If there is no evidence of ongoing myocarditis, they can be offered vaccination with the Pfizer (Cominarty) vaccine from 12 weeks after their last dose if further doses are due.  If there is evidence of ongoing effects of acute or subacute myocarditis, then an individual risk benefit assessment should be undertaken in consultation with the patient or their parents or guardians prior to offering further doses of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>These recommendations are based on information from Yellow Card reporting data and other published data.</p>

<h2>Activity following vaccination</h2>

<p>If the individual feels well after receiving their <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination then there is no need to pre-emptively restrict physical activity post vaccination and individuals can continue with their pre-existing level of physical activity.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that they experience chest pain, palpitations, unexpected shortness of breath, or fainting, then they should seek medical attention.</p>

<p>Such individuals should be investigated and managed according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals">clinical management guidelines</a>. This advice applies to both adults and children. Strenuous physical activity should be avoided until symptoms improve. If an individual has been diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis, advice on exercise should be given by a qualified healthcare professional (for example, cardiologist, sports cardiologist or sports medicine physician) and should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/40/1/19/5248228" rel="external">clinical guidelines</a> on when to resume activity or competitive sports.</p>
