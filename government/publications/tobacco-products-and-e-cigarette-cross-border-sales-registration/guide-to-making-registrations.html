<h2>Changes to the requirement to register</h2>

<p>The requirement to register for cross-border distance sales (<abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr>) to and from the UK changed after the UK’s transition period with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> ended on 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>’s Tobacco Products Directive will continue to apply in Northern Ireland. This means retailers making cross-border distance sales into or out of Northern Ireland are required to register to supply tobacco products and e-cigarettes (including e-liquids, refill containers, devices, and components).</p>

<p>This includes retailers in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland) selling to customers in Northern Ireland and retailers in Northern Ireland selling to customers in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states.</p>

<p>Retailers located outside of Northern Ireland (including those based in Great Britain) who want to sell to customers in Northern Ireland must also register with the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>). Retailers located in Great Britain who want to sell to customers in other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states must register with that member state’s relevant competent authority.</p>

<h2>Registration criteria</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/507/part/8" rel="external">Registration is a requirement under Part 8 of the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (<abbr title="Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016">TRPR</abbr>) 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Whether a retailer needs to register for <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> depends on the location of the retailer and their customers. Retailers located in Northern Ireland must continue to complete the registration process with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> before making <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> to customers in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states. Retailers based anywhere outside of Northern Ireland selling to customers in Northern Ireland must also register with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>, the UK competent authority.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, retailers located in Great Britain are no longer required by the <abbr title="Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016">TRPR</abbr> to register with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> for <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> into <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states or countries in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), but they must register if they intend to make <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> into Northern Ireland. However, retailers in Great Britain must register their intention to sell into any <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state or state in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> with that relevant country’s competent authority.</p>

<p>Retailers do not need to complete the <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> registration form if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>located in Great Britain and selling to customers outside Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>located in Northern Ireland and selling only to customers in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>located in Northern Ireland and selling only to customers in Great Britain or other countries that are not in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where retailers are required to register with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> (the UK’s competent authority), they must complete the registration form. This will submit their information to <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tobacco-products-and-e-cigarette-cross-border-sales-registration">Complete the registration form</a></p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will review registrations for compliance with the regulations. This includes the description of the electronic age verification system used to confirm their customers’ age is above the minimum age for buying these products in the state where the customer is located.</p>

<p>Retailers must not make <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> to a customer located in an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state or a state in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> where <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> are banned.</p>

<p>Registration is not required by retailers that trade exclusively with other retailers.</p>

<h2>Registration requirements</h2>

<p>The table below shows whether a retailer needs to register with <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> for <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr>, depending on where they and their customers are based.</p>

<h2>Confirmation of registration</h2>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will send retailers an email within 30 days of submitting the <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> registration form. If the retailer is registering to sell products in <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will confirm this initial registration. <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will then send a final confirmation once the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states approve the registration.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> is required to publish <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tobacco-products-and-e-cigarette-cross-border-sales-%20registration/list-of-registered-retailers">compliant registered retailers’ trading names and website addresses</a>.</p>

<p>Registration forms submitted by retailers who are not required to do so will be rejected and not published.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will publish an updated registrations list in line with the regulations.</p>

<p>If the submitted information does not comply with the <abbr title="Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016">TRPR</abbr>, <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> will contact the retailer to resolve any issues.</p>

<h2>Countries that allow cross-border distance sales of tobacco and e-cigarette products</h2>

<p>Retailers in the UK who want to make <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states or countries in the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> should contact the competent authority for that state before selling to customers located there.</p>

<p>The table below shows the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member states and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> countries that have confirmed whether they allow <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr> of tobacco and e-cigarette products. It also shows the website or contact details for those countries for retailers to register for <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Retailers who intend to trade in countries where the sales confirmation, registration website or contact details are yet to be confirmed in the table below should contact the relevant national authorities before supplying their products.</p>

<p>Where states have not permitted <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr>, it will break the law to sell tobacco and e-cigarette products to customers in those countries.</p>

<p>It’s illegal to sell tobacco and e-cigarette products to customers in countries where they do not allow <abbr title="cross border distance sales">CBDS</abbr>.</p>
