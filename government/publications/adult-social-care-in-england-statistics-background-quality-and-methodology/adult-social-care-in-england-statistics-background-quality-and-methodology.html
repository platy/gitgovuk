<h2>About these statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics are badged as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/guidance-on-experimental-statistics" rel="external">experimental statistics</a> and are undergoing development and further assessment of quality. Data is being published to provide insight into how COVID-19 has impacted the social care sector and its response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>These statistics will be assessed regularly and any improvements in quality will be incorporated accordingly at the next available opportunity. The scope of the data included in this publication will also be assessed to ensure the value of these statistics is maintained.</p>

<p>The data in this publication includes the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) publishes monthly statistics on COVID-19 in adult social care settings. This document primarily sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate the statistics.</p>

<p>These statistics currently cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first, second and booster COVID-19 vaccinations in social care settings for staff and residents</li>
  <li>visiting in care homes</li>
  <li>COVID-19 related absence rates in care homes and domiciliary care settings</li>
  <li>COVID-19 testing for staff, residents and visitors of care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>The content of this publication has frequently changed over the past year in order to reflect ongoing changes to the data source which this publication is primarily based on.</p>

<p>Previously, this publication also covered topics which were removed either because the data collection ceased or because of limited information on data quality:</p>

<ul>
  <li>infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures, including staff movement across different social care settings and payment of full wages when care home staff were isolating due to COVID-19. Collection ceased on 4 April 2022</li>
  <li>flu vaccinations for the 2021 to 2022 season for social care staff and residents. Collection ceased on 4 April 2022, at the end of the flu vaccination campaign</li>
  <li>staffing levels in care homes. Collection ceased on 3 August 2022, following feedback from stakeholders suggesting the statistics did not accurately reflect the workforce pressures faced by the sector</li>
  <li>personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) availability in care homes and domiciliary care. Publication ceased in September 2022, due to limited information on response rates to these questions</li>
</ul>

<p>For information about the statistics which were removed from the publication, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology">Adult social care in England statistics: background quality and methodology (May 2021 to August 2022)</a>.</p>

<h2>Data sources and collection</h2>

<p>COVID-19 vaccination, visiting and staff absence rates data in the publication is taken from management information submitted by care providers in England to a data collection and insight tool called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.necsu.nhs.uk/capacity-tracker/" rel="external">Capacity Tracker</a>.</p>

<h3>Background on Capacity Tracker</h3>

<p>Capacity Tracker was originally developed by NHS England and the Better Care Fund to enable the system to better manage hospital discharges by identifying available capacity in care homes. It enables care homes to share their vacancies in real time, meaning hospital discharge teams and other health professionals can rapidly search availability throughout England.</p>

<p>Capacity Tracker was identified as a suitable tool for COVID-19 data collection from care providers. Its repurposing was announced via the governmentâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan">action plan</a> (15 April 2020) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/bulletins/gd/UKCQC-286ff51" rel="external">joint letter</a> (17 April 2020) from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) together with the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>) and the Care Provider Alliance.</p>

<p>From May 2020 to 31 March 2022, providers received a financial incentive, via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund">Adult Social Care Infection Control and Testing Fund (<abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr>)</a> to submit data on Capacity Tracker. <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr> provided funding from local authorities to ensure that <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures were in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. To support the monitoring of the fund, questions tracking the adult social care sectorâs implementation of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures were collected. Providers self-report their responses and were expected to submit on a weekly basis. The fund ended on 31 March 2022, resulting in the reduction of the number of questions asked via Capacity Tracker, but care providers were still encouraged to keep submitting answers for the remaining questions.</p>

<p>On 31 July 2022, the submission of a core subset of data via Capacity Tracker was made mandatory through a provision in the Health and Care Act 2022 which received Royal Assent in April 2022. Care providers are mandated to submit updated data on a monthly basis, within a specific window. Providers must submit their data in the 7 days leading to the 14th day of each month, or the next working day where the 14th falls on a weekend or public holiday. Data must be no more than a week out of date.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-care-act-2022-adult-social-care-provider-information-provisions">guidance on the mandatory data collection</a> was published on 14 July 2022. From 31 July 2022, providers will, where possible, be given 3 monthsâ notice before new data fields become mandatory.</p>

<p>A provision to make enforcement regulations will come into effect in November 2022.</p>

<p>Changes to Capacity Tracker will be reflected in this publication as and when they occur.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 and flu vaccination data</h3>

<p>From 31 July 2022, vaccination data is part of the subset of data which providers are mandated to submit on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The Capacity Tracker data collection on first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccination began in December 2020 for care homes, and in February 2021 for independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered domiciliary care providers and for other settings including non-registered providers and local authority employed. Providers self-report their total number of staff and residents and the number of staff and residents who have received the COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

<p>Data collection on first booster doses for the COVID-19 vaccine began in September 2021 and the data has been reported in this publication since November 2021. Data collection on second boosters began in April 2022 and was published for the first time in August 2022.</p>

<p>Flu vaccination for the 2021 to 2022 season was collected in Capacity Tracker between September 2021 and March 2022 and featured in publications between November 2021 and May 2022. Flu vaccination for the 2022 to 2023 season was added to Capacity Tracker on 1 September 2022 and will be included in this publication in due course.</p>

<p>Providers are only asked to review and submit the number of individuals who are reported to be vaccinated. Providers are not asked about those who are not vaccinated. This means that the number of individuals who have not received the vaccine cannot be directly derived from data published in these statistics as there may be a number of individuals whose vaccination status is unknown to the care provider.</p>

<p>Vaccination rates among care home staff vary substantially between those who are directly employed by the care homes and those employed by agencies operating within care homes. This could be due to different uptake rates of the vaccine as well as different proportions of staff whose vaccination status is unknown. Therefore, directly comparing the vaccination rate of directly employed staff to agency staff should be done with caution as the 2 groups are likely to have different percentages of staff whose vaccination status is unknown. Care homes are less likely to know the vaccination status of their agency staff due to the nature of their employment.</p>

<h3>Accommodating COVID-19 safe visiting in care homes</h3>

<p>From 31 July 2022, visiting data is part of the subset of data which providers are mandated to submit on a monthly basis. The Capacity Tracker data collection on COVID-19 safe visiting in care homes started in May 2020.</p>

<p>Care home providers self-report whether they are able to accommodate residents receiving visitors in all circumstances, exceptional circumstances or no circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are individually defined by each care home but are generally thought to be considered when residents are palliative.</p>

<p>This data was first collected as part of the subset of questions asked to monitor the implementation of <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures. Up until 4 April 2022, this subset of questions also included other questions which previously featured in this publication. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limitation of staff movement across different social care settings</li>
  <li>payment of full wages when staff are isolating due to COVID-19 in care homes</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-fund">adult social care <abbr title="Infection Control and Testing Fund">ICTF</abbr></a>, which was introduced to support adult social care providers in implementing <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures and reducing the rate of COVID-19 transmission within and between care settings, ended on 31 March 2022. On 31 March 2022, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> published new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-settings">infection prevention and control guidance on managing specific infections</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement">COVID-19 supplement to reduce the spread of COVID-19</a> in adult social care settings in England, which both apply from 4 April 2022.</p>

<p>As a result of the end of the fund and of the publication of the new guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19">Living with COVID-19</a>, data on <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> collected via Capacity tracker was cut back. The question on COVID-safe visitation in care homes remains, and this publication will continue to present this data. On 4 July 2022, the visiting questions changed in Capacity Tracker, which now asks about whether care homes have been able to accommodate visiting in the past month rather than in the last 7 days. Data after 4 July 2022 has remained consistent with data from before the question change. The question change is flagged in the data tables.</p>

<h3>Staff absences due to COVID-19 related reasons</h3>

<p>From 31 July 2022, staff absence data is part of the subset of data which providers are mandated to submit on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The Capacity Tracker data collection on staff absences related to COVID-19 started in December 2020 for care homes and independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered domiciliary care providers.</p>

<p>Care home providers self-report their total number of staff in the establishment (nurses, care workers and non-care workers) and the number of staff absent due to COVID-19 related reasons.</p>

<p>Independent <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered domiciliary care providers self-report the total number of staff who have face-to-face contact with care recipients and the number who are not working because of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>This data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics (England): methodology</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-extension-to-infection-control-and-testing-fund-2021">adult social care Rapid Testing Fund</a> was first announced on 23 December 2020 to support the rollout of rapid lateral flow testing in care homes. The funding was extended until the end of March 2022, to support additional testing of staff in care homes, and enable indoor, close contact visiting where possible. No further specific testing funding will be provided in 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>From 4 April 2022, the government continues to provide tests to the sector to help manage the spread of COVID-19, prioritising groups most at risk of infection, and reducing testing requirements where possible to ease the additional burden testing places on care services. At the time of publication, the adult social care settings outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">COVID-19 testing in adult social care guidance</a> continue to have access to free testing to support asymptomatic, symptomatic and outbreak testing.</p>

<h2>Data coverage</h2>

<p>All data in this publication refers to social care settings in England only.</p>

<p>Data submitted by providers reflects the current priorities to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in social care settings. Data collection could be subject to change based on changes to the priorities and therefore the reporting in this publication will be adapted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Capacity Tracker data</h3>

<p>Currently all data fields from Capacity Tracker presented in this publication are part of the subset of data which is mandated. Since 31 July 2022, providers have been required to submit this data on a monthly basis, within a specific time window â the 7 days leading up to the 14th day of the month, or the next working day if the 14th is a public holiday or a weekend. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-care-act-2022-adult-social-care-provider-information-provisions/adult-social-care-provider-information-provisions-guidance-for-providers-on-data-collection">guidance on the mandatory data collection</a> was published on 14 July 2022.</p>

<p>Response rates increased substantially following the start of the mandation. For care homes, responses increased from 73.8% in the week ending 13 July 2022 to 92.7% in the week ending 15 August 2022, which marked the close of the first mandation window. For domiciliary care, responses increased from 65.4% to 78.5% over the same period. Response rates are expected to increase further in the next few months.</p>

<p>Response rates from August 2022 onwards cannot be used to estimate the rates of compliance with the mandatory provision of certain data items as set out in the adult social care provider information provisions. Response rates during the reporting window as set out in the adult social care provider information provisions are not equivalent to compliance rates because there may be extenuating circumstances in which a provider has not responded for legitimate reasons.</p>

<h4>Visiting in care homes and staff absences due to COVID-19 related reasons</h4>

<p>Data is self-reported by care providers. Since 31 July 2022, they are mandated to submit this data on a monthly basis. Prior to 31 July 2022, providers were expected to submit data weekly, but on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>The statistics published in the accompanying tables present weekly data points from December 2020 to the end of July 2022. From August 2022 onwards, the tables present one data point per month, which reflect the data reported during the mandation window that month, up to 23:59 on the last day of the mandation window.</p>

<p>From August 2022 onwards, any care home that has not submitted data within the mandation window is excluded from the relevant analysis for that month. This is to avoid skewing the data. This means that the total number of care homes and staff varies over time and between tables. The full response rates for all data points are available in the accompanying tables.</p>

<p>Prior to August 2022, responses that were not submitted within the 7 days prior were also excluded each week. Each reporting week referred to data up to 2pm on the date stated as the âweek endingâ and the 7 days prior.</p>

<p>Absence rates related to COVID-19 are calculated using the reported number of staff employed and the reported number of staff out of work that day because of COVID-19 related reasons. Absence rates might be affected by provider response rates.</p>

<p>Absence data started to be reported by care providers in Capacity Tracker from December 2020. However, in the first few months of collection, due to low response rates, the workforce data is incomplete, which affects the accuracy of the absence data during that period.</p>

<p>Providers who are the least likely to respond are likely to be those experiencing the most pressures on their staff, due to high levels of absences. As such, data from December 2020 to the start of February 2021 for care homes, and from December 2020 to the start of March 2021 for domiciliary care providers, are not presented in this publication.</p>

<p>COVID-19 related absences cannot be directly linked to staff positivity rates. This is because absences related to COVID-19 can cover a wide range of reasons, including but not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing positive to COVID-19</li>
  <li>isolating</li>
  <li>caring for someone who has tested positive to COVID-19</li>
  <li>suffering from illness related to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>The total number of staff reported in these tables will be lower than the total care workforce because only care homes who have filled in the relevant section of Capacity Tracker in the last 7 days are included in the staff counts each week. If a care home has not recently responded to this question, their staff count will not be included. A count of all staff, for all care homes who have responded to Capacity Tracker at least once, can be found in the vaccination tables. This is because the vaccination rates are cumulative and therefore include all care homes, whether they have replied recently or not.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 and flu vaccination</h4>

<p>Data is self-reported by care providers and since 31 July 2022 they are mandated to submit this data on a monthly basis, but are still encouraged to update their data on a weekly basis where possible. Prior to 31 July 2022, providers were expected to submit data weekly, but on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>The statistics published in the accompanying tables present weekly data points, even after August 2022. This is because weekly data updates are encouraged and weekly data points allow us to capture updates made by providers outside the monthly mandation window. Response rates are likely to be higher during the mandation window and may be lower in other weeks of the month. Therefore, weeks which coincide with the mandation window may see a bigger increase in vaccination rates, due to higher response rates in those weeks. These weeks are clearly flagged in the accompanying data tables.</p>

<p>Data on the proportion of social care staff and residents who have received a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is available from the December 2021 report. These rates do not distinguish between those who are eligible for a booster, given the recommended gap between second and booster doses. Data on the proportion of residents who have received a second booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is available from the August 2022 report.</p>

<p>The methodology used to calculate response rates has been updated several times to improve accuracy. These changes affected the response rates, but not the vaccination rates.</p>

<p>From July 2022 publication onwards, a provider is counted as having responded for each vaccination dose if the date of their last update on Capacity Tracker (which is recorded automatically when they access the system) is after the date at which the data field relating to that dose was added to the collection. However, providers with zero in every vaccination data field are still counted as non-responses.</p>

<p>Data for care homes and domiciliary care relates to up to 11:59pm on the day reported as the âweek endingâ. For other settings this relates up to 8:00am on the day reported as the âweek endingâ. Until 4 April 2022, the reporting week usually ends on a Tuesday but occasionally no data is available for this date. In these situations the âweek endingâ date will be the nearest available date. From 4 April 2022, the reporting week ends on a Wednesday for the table on âother social care settingsâ (including non-registered providers and local authority employed), but continues to end on a Tuesday for all other vaccination tables.</p>

<p>Older adult care homes are defined as care homes serving any older people (aged 65), as identified from the latest <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data on care homes in the âolder peopleâ service user band. Some residents in these care homes may be aged under 65. The remainder of the care homes are classed as younger adult care homes. Staff refers to both those directly employed by the care provider and agency staff.</p>

<p>The total numbers of residents and staff may include individuals who did not receive the vaccine for valid medical reasons or where consent to receive the vaccination was not received.</p>

<h3>NHS Test and Trace service data</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>The number of tests conducted in this report includes care homes staff, residents and visitors tested by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PCR and rapid lateral flow kits sent directly to the care home for regular testing, which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure</li>
  <li>PCR and rapid lateral flow kits conducted at another testing site such as a regional or local test site or a mobile testing unit or tests that were registered</li>
</ul>

<p>The figures in this report are only deduplicated to report on the number of individual tests taken, not the number of people tested. As individuals can have more than one test, the data should not be compared with prevalence or case positivity rates. Therefore, this report only includes the total number of tests and the number of tests with a positive result and not positivity rates.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted in care home staff also includes staff who additionally work across other care settings such as domiciliary care. It may also include some staff who solely work in another social care setting other than a care home but are unable to be distinguished due to the way occupation is identified in the data.</p>

<p>An update to the methodology was implemented to the testing for COVID-19 in care homes data, from the âAdult social care in England, monthly statistics: July 2021â publication onwards. Prior to that, it included tests where someone had identified their occupation as any of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>care worker or home carer</li>
  <li>residential, day or domiciliary care manager or proprietor</li>
  <li>senior care worker</li>
</ul>

<p>Tests where someone has identified their occupation as one of the above and the test is associated with testing kits sent to domiciliary care providers are now removed from the counts. However, tests where someone has identified their occupation as one of the above but the test is not associated with testing kits sent to domiciliary care providers, have not been excluded.</p>

<p>The timeseries in the âAdult social care in England, monthly statistics: July 2021â publication and all subsequent publications have been backdated with the new methodology which has resulted in the removal of a substantial number of tests compared to past publications.</p>

<p>This report does not contain data on those tested through pillar 1.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted is reported by type of test and by the individual role (staff, resident, visitor and visiting professional) which is captured when the test is registered. For some tests a limited amount of information is available therefore the individual role cannot be determined. These tests are reported separately in the data tables.</p>

<p>The requirement for care home staff to register negative rapid lateral flow test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive, following a change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff. As a result, a proportion of rapid lateral flow tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.</p>

<p>Other changes in testing guidance in social care settings have affected trends in the data. These changes are listed below.</p>

<h4>Changes in guidance</h4>

<h5>From 31 August 2022</h5>

<p>No asymptomatic testing for staff, residents or visitors.</p>

<p>Symptomatic testing for staff and residents: 2 rapid lateral flow tests taken 48 hours apart.</p>

<h5>4 April 2022 to 30 August 2022</h5>

<p>Staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>asymptomatic testing: 2 rapid lateral flow tests per week</li>
  <li>symptomatic testing: 2 rapid lateral flow tests taken 48 hours apart</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>asymptomatic testing: no testing</li>
  <li>symptomatic testing: 2 rapid lateral flow tests taken 48 hours apart</li>
</ul>

<p>Visitors: no requirement to test, unless providing personal care.</p>

<h5>16 February 2022 to 3 April 2022</h5>

<p>Staff: pre shift rapid lateral flow tests.</p>

<p>Care homes were able to transition to the new testing regime any time between the announcement on 27 January 2022 and 16 February 2022, which means this change could have affected trends before 16 February 2022.</p>

<h5>From 11 January 2022</h5>

<p>Staff and residents: removal of confirmatory PCR test following a positive rapid lateral flow test.</p>

<h5>15 December 2021 to 15 February 2022</h5>

<p>Staff: weekly PCR and 3 rapid lateral flow tests per week.</p>

<h5>7 June 2020 to 14 December 2021</h5>

<p>Staff: weekly PCR and 2 rapid lateral flow tests per week.</p>

<p>Residents: monthly PCR.</p>

<p>Visitors: required to take rapid lateral flow test before each visit (tests are free).</p>

<p>PCR tests for staff and residents if symptomatic.</p>

<h2>Data quality</h2>

<p>This section measures the adult social care statistics against the dimensions of quality set out by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/#the-european-statistical-system-s-dimensions-of-quality" rel="external">Government Statistical Service for statistical outputs</a>.</p>

<p>Any feedback on these statistics is welcome and can be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:asc.statistics@dhsc.gov.uk">asc.statistics@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

<p>These are monthly statistics by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> of statistics on adult social care in England. This statistical bulletin provides an overview on a range of information on social care settings, with a focus on the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>These statistics are published to provide an overview of how COVID-19 has impacted the adult social care sector and provide transparency and insight into how the care sector is adapting to living with COVID-19. This publication aims to improve access to various data on adult social care, especially in relation to COVID-19, by providing a comprehensive, easily accessible bulletin.</p>

<p>These statistics are being badged as experimental statistics while frequent changes are being made to the data being collected via Capacity Tracker.</p>

<h2>Accuracy and reliability</h2>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<h4>COVID-19 and flu vaccination</h4>

<p>Coverage is limited to care providers registered and providing data to Capacity Tracker. As data is self-reported by care providers for their staff and residents, trends in the data must consider response rates as some care providers report the total number of staff or residents but not the number vaccinated.</p>

<p>Additionally, a proportion of staff and residents will have an unknown vaccination status. This will have an impact on the deviation from the true value for all care providers. More details can be found in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<p>In order to classify older and younger adult care homes we use a combination of the monthly <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> care directory registers and the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> application programming interface (API) for newly active care homes. When a care home is not found in either data source, the care home is classified as a younger adult care home until data is made available. This data can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/transparency/using-cqc-data" rel="external">Using <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> data</a>.</p>

<p>Validation checks are implemented by the data supplier to ensure the number of staff or residents vaccinated entered by care providers cannot be higher than the number of staff residents.</p>

<h4>Visiting in care homes</h4>

<p>Coverage is limited to care providers registered and providing data to Capacity Tracker. Data is self-reported by care providers and can be influenced by response rates. More details on response rates can be found in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>Data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service. This report will only include tests which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

<p>The data tables for this publication are produced by a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) using the statistical software âRâ. This reduces the likelihood of certain processing errors by minimising the amount of manual processing or compiling of data. All stages in this pipeline are quality assured by a professional analyst.</p>

<h4>COVID-19 testing</h4>

<p>Data from approximately 2 months before the cut-off date is updated each month. This is because there can be delays between the time a test is taken and the time its result is logged into the system and reflected in the data. Data prior to the last 2 months is computed using a frozen dataset, meaning the statistics are not updated every month because we assume no significant number of new test results will affect the data.</p>

<h2>Timeliness and punctuality</h2>

<p>These statistics are updated on a monthly basis and the data in each publication relates up to 2 weeks prior to the publication date. The lag is to allow time for data to be collected and ensure quality assurances processes can be carried out.</p>

<p>Since 31 July 2022, providers are mandated to update a subset of data every month, within a specific window â the 7 days prior to the 14th day of each month, or the next working day where the 14th falls on a weekend or public holiday. From September 2022, this publication is released on the first Thursday of each month instead of the second Thursday of each month, in order to keep the lag between data input and publication to approximately 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The frequency of these publications will be evaluated while <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> continues to scope out the needs of users and stakeholders.</p>

<p>More timely data on COVID-19 vaccinations and testing in adult social care in England is available through other sources. More details on this can be found in the âdata sources and collectionâ section above.</p>

<h2>Comparability and coherence</h2>

<p>Capacity Tracker data is self-reported from care providers and comparability over time is influenced by response rates. The latest response rates and how they influence the time series can be found in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination</h3>

<h4>Other sources of data</h4>

<p><abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> also publishes data on vaccinations in adult social care settings as part of its broader <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/" rel="external">statistical release on COVID-19 vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>Both publications follow the same methodology and use the same data source but there are some differences, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reporting period prior to April 2022, when data in this publication reports data collected up to 11:59pm on a Tuesday whereas <abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> used data collected up to 11:59pm on a Sunday. However, since April 2022 <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> also uses data collected up to 11:59pm on a Tuesday</li>
  <li>a small amount of data may be collected after the respective reporting periods</li>
  <li>regional breakdowns â data in this publication uses the administrative regions of England and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> uses NHS regions</li>
</ul>

<p>Outputs from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>âs adult social care monthly statistics publication are also compared against internal <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> analysis carried out by other professional analysts in the department.</p>

<h3>Workforce statistics</h3>

<h4>Other sources of data</h4>

<p>In December 2021, an additional workforce report providing more information on the pressures faced by the adult social care workforce was published as part of this data collection. This information was received through an ad hoc survey and has been published as part of this collection as a one-time event. The survey covers more detailed insight into current workforce pressures faced compared to 6 months previously. This includes issues relating to recruitment, retention, staff morale and use of agency staff. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-workforce-survey-december-2021">adult social care workforce survey: December 2021 report</a>.</p>

<p>The workforce survey complements the regular collection by providing the opportunity to have a deeper exploration of workforce issues, which is possible in an ad hoc survey but would be too burdensome for the regular collection. The workforce survey collected information from both care homes and domiciliary care providers.</p>

<p>Skills for Care publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/Topics/COVID-19/Staffing-and-occupancy-monthly-tracking.aspx" rel="external">yearly and monthly estimates</a> of the number of adult social care filled posts as a measurement of the size of the adult social care workforce. Differences in data sources and methodology mean that these statistics are not comparable to those published in this report.</p>

<p>Skills for Careâs monthly tracking data on staffing is based on the unweighted responses of a relatively small cohort of providers who have updated records in the Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set in each respective month. This data may not be representative of the sector as a whole and therefore may only be indicative of general trends. Skills for Care uses a wider definition of domiciliary care than is used in Capacity Tracker and includes other services delivered in the userâs own home, such as supported living and extra care housing.</p>

<p>Skills for Care also publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/Topics/COVID-19/days-lost-due-to-sickness.aspx" rel="external">monthly estimates of the average number of days lost due to sickness</a>, which are not comparable to the absence rates published in this report. This is because of similar reasons explained above and due to the nature of Skills for Careâs estimate which is not specific to COVID-19 related absences.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>Data is from management information collected during the Test and Trace process. The level of testing and guidance on how frequently those in the adult social care sector should be tested has changed over time and as a result comparison between certain time periods should be made with caution. More information on the testing rollout in care homes is available in the âdata coverageâ section above.</p>

<h4>Other sources of data</h4>

<p>Until June 2022, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also published care home testing data at national level in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports">NHS Test and Trace statistics release</a>. The frequency of this publication and accompanying data tables was reduced from weekly publications to fortnightly publications of weekly data from 14 April 2022, before the publication was discontinued altogether from 23 June 2022. Up to June 2022, this publication used the same data source but had a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes. Differences in the figures occurred due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>differences in which tests from different routes are included</li>
  <li>different reporting periods</li>
  <li>different times of extracting the data</li>
</ul>

<h5>Differences in which tests from different routes are included</h5>

<p>Both methodologies include the number of tests registered from kits sent directly to care homes, but this publication additionally includes care home staff or residents tested via other routes such as regional or local test sites. As a result, figures in this report will be substantially higher for PCR tests conducted in care home staff due to the current guidance recommending staff with symptoms to be tested outside of the care home (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> for more information).</p>

<p>Since 11 January 2022, due to recent high prevalence, confirmatory PCR tests after a positive lateral flow test result are no longer required for the wider population, including the care home population. This could result in a lower number of PCR tests taken inside and outside care homes reported in this monthly report. The number reported in the weekly NHS Test and Trace statistics, will also be affected by this change in guidance, but to a lower extent as it does not include tests taken outside the care home.</p>

<h5>Different reporting periods</h5>
<p>This publication uses the start time of the test in comparison to the Test and Trace statistics which use the date on which the test result was received by the individual taking the test.</p>

<p>For more details on the NHS Test and Trace programme and the statistics please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace methodology document</a>.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and clarity</h2>

<p>These statistics are freely available on the GOV.UK website with all documents published in an accessible format. The statistical reports and âBackground quality and methodologyâ documents are published in HTML and accompanying data tables are published in OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) format.</p>

<p>This âBackground quality and methodologyâ document is published to ensure users have sufficient information on how these statistics can be used.</p>

<p>The commentary is written with the aim of being clear and impartial. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will continue to scope user and stakeholder needs to ensure the commentary sufficiently meets their needs.</p>

<h2>Cost and burden</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination, visiting and staff absences</h3>

<p>The burden associated with providing data through Capacity Tracker varies among questions and in line with provider resources.</p>

<p>Until April 2022, some of these questions were to be reported daily (COVID-19 vaccinations, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, staffing levels, staff absences) and some weekly (infection control). Between May 2021 and 31 March 2022, care providers were expected to provide data regularly to Capacity Tracker as a condition of receiving Infection Control and Testing Funding. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-infection-control-and-testing-fund-round-3">Adult Social Care Infection Control and Testing Fund: round 3</a> for more details. The funding ceased in April 2022 but providers were still expected to provide weekly data up until July 2022.</p>

<p>From April 2022 to July 2022, all questions were expected to be reported weekly, to reduce the burden on providers and a subset of questions on infection prevention control were removed to reduce the burden further.</p>

<p>From 31 July 2022, instead of a voluntary weekly update, providers are mandated to update Capacity Tracker monthly, which further reduces the burden on providers. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-care-act-2022-adult-social-care-provider-information-provisions">guidance and impact assessment on the adult social care information provisions under the Health and Care Act 2022</a> for more information. Providers are still encouraged to submit data more regularly where possible.</p>

<p>A high burden on providers to supply data might impact the quality of the data in terms of accuracy, coverage and consistency. Responses that have been submitted outside the mandation window or more than 7 days before the date reported in the publication are excluded as part of the analysis for these statistics.</p>

<p>To improve coverage, the relevance of questions is regularly reviewed in collaboration with care providers and stakeholders and questions which no longer provide value are adjusted or removed.</p>

<h2>Revisions</h2>

<p>Any revisions to past publications will be in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-dhsc"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>âs revision policy</a>. Any unscheduled or substantial revisions that do not fit into the scheduled revisions criteria will be highlighted accordingly.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 vaccination, visiting and staff absences</h3>

<p>Some data may be collected after the initial publication period and therefore may need to be revised over time.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 testing</h3>

<p>Some data may be collected after the initial publication period and therefore may need to be revised over time. Figures from approximately 2 months before the cut-off date are updated each time.</p>
