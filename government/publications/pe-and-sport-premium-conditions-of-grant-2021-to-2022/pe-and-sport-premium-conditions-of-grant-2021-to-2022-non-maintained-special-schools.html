<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The primary PE and sport premium 2021 to 2022 (“the premium”) will be paid by the Secretary of State for Education (“Secretary of State”) to the non-maintained special school as stated in section 14 of the Education Act 2002.In accordance with Section 16 of that Act, the Secretary of State lays down the following terms and conditions on which financial assistance is given in relation to the premium payable for the academic year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The premium for the 2021 to 2022 academic year is paid in 2 instalments from the Secretary of State to the non-maintained special school as follows:</p>

  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose of the premium</h2>

<p>The premium must be used to fund additional and sustainable improvements to the provision of PE and sport, for the benefit of primary-aged pupils, in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, to encourage the development of healthy, active lifestyles. The Secretary of State has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pe-and-sport-premium-for-primary-schools">information on how much PE and sport premium funding primary schools receive, and advice on how to spend it.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Basis of allocation</h2>

<p>Allocations for the academic year 2021 to 2022 are calculated using the number of pupils in years 1 to 6, as recorded in the January 2021 census, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools with 17 or more pupils receive £16,000 plus £10 per pupil; and</li>
  <li>schools with 16 or fewer pupils receive £1,000 per pupil</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a school’s pupils are not recorded by year group, pupils aged 5 to 10 are deemed eligible.
In the case of a school which has opened or is due to open during the 2021 to 2022 academic year, the above formula will apply based on pupils recorded on the autumn 2021 school census.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Terms on which the premium is allocated to schools</h2>

<p>The premium must be spent in full by the end of the 2021 to 2022 academic year. This includes any carried forward under-spent funding that has resulted from the relaxations to the ring-fencing arrangements of the PE and sport premium because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Schools must use the funding to make additional and sustainable improvements to the provision of PE and sport for the benefit of all pupils to encourage the development of healthy, active lifestyles.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State does not consider the following expenditure as falling within the scope of additional or sustainable improvement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employing coaches or specialist teachers to cover planning preparation and assessment (PPA) arrangements - these should come out of schools’ core staffing budgets</li>
  <li>teaching the minimum requirements of your existing PE curriculum</li>
  <li>fund capital expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>The non-maintained special school must publish, on their website, information about their use of the premium by the end of the summer term or 31 July 2022 at the latest.</p>

<p>The non-maintained special school must publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of premium received</li>
  <li>a full breakdown of how it has been spent</li>
  <li>what impact the school has seen on pupils’ PE and sport participation and attainment</li>
  <li>how the improvements will be sustainable in the future</li>
  <li>what percentage of pupils within their year 6 cohort for academic year 2021 to 2022 can do each of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>swim competently, confidently and proficiently over a distance of at least 25 metres</li>
      <li>use a range of strokes effectively
*perform safe self-rescue in different water-based situations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If selected, schools must also take part in a sampling review to scrutinise their compliance with these conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Variation</h2>

<p>The basis for allocation of the premium may be varied by the Secretary of State from those set out above, if requested by the non-maintained special school or at the discretion of the Secretary of State.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Other conditions</h2>

<p>If the non-maintained special school fails to comply with the conditions set out in the paragraphs above, including but not limited to the non-maintained special school misusing the premium, the Secretary of State may require the repayment of the whole or any part of the premium paid to the non-maintained special school or the withholding of subsequent instalments of the premium.</p>

<p>This will be notified in writing to the non-maintained special school and any such sum that has been notified shall immediately become payable to the Secretary of State or withheld from future instalments of the premium.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Overpayments</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State will conduct a final reconciliation on the PE and Sport Grant funding. Any overpayment made to the non-maintained special school by the Secretary of State will either be recovered by the Secretary of State reducing future payments to recover any overpayments or the non-maintained special school will repay any overpayment within 30 days of receiving an invoice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Further information</h2>

<p>The books and other documents and records relating to the recipient’s accounts (for the purposes of this grant “recipient” is the non-maintained special school) shall be open to inspection by the Secretary of State and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, pursuant to Section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the recipient has used its resources in discharging its grant-aided activities.</p>

<p>The non-maintained special school shall provide such further information as may be required by the Secretary of State for the purpose of determining whether, or to what extent, it has complied with the conditions set out in this document.</p>

<p>Failure to provide this information may result in the Secretary of State requiring repayment of the whole or any part of the premium paid to the non-maintained special school, according to the method outlined in paragraph 5, or the withholding of subsequent instalments of the premium.</p>
