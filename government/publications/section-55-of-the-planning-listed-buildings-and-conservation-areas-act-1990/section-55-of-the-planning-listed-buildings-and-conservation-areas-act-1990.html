<h2>Guidance note on procedure for the Secretary of State to issue a determination</h2>

<p>A. This guidance note is for an owner of a property which has been the
subject of an urgent works notice under section 54 of the Planning (Listed
Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, who has now been served
with a notice under section 55 for the recovery of some or all of the costs
of those works.</p>

<p>B. This guidance note is also for the local authority/Historic England/the
Secretary of State, whichever undertook the urgent works and has now
served a section 55 notice in order to recover the costs of those works
from the owner. For the purposes of this guidance note, the party seeking
recovery of the costs is referred to below as the “authority”.</p>

<p>N.B. It is open to the parties to have legal representation in the procedure
outlined below, but the section 55 procedure has been designed to allow parties
to represent themselves.</p>

<h3>The owner’s first representations</h3>

<p>The owner may within 28 days of the service of the section 55 notice
represent to the Secretary of State:</p>

<p>a) that some or all of the works were unnecessary for the preservation of
the building;</p>

<p>b) in the case of works for affording temporary support or shelter, that the
temporary arrangements have continued for an unreasonable length of
time;</p>

<p>c) that the amount specified in the notice is unreasonable; and/or</p>

<p>d) that the recovery of that amount would cause him hardship.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State expects that the use of section 54 should be
restricted to emergency works for the preservation of the building, for
example works to keep a building wind and weather-proof and safe from
collapse, or action to prevent vandalism or theft. The steps taken should
be the minimum consistent with achieving this objective, and should not
involve the owner in unnecessary expense.</p>

<p>The representation(s) should be addressed to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport, 
<br>Heritage Team,
<br>4th Floor,
<br>100 Parliament Street,
<br>London,
<br>SW1A 2BQ
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>The owner should confirm in the letter that he was the owner of the
building as at the date of the section 55 notice and state if any other
person had an interest in it at that date. He should also state whether or
not the building or a part of the building was occupied at the time when the
urgent works were undertaken. The owner should provide with his letter
copies of the relevant section 54 and section 55 notices that were served
by the authority.</p>

<p>The owner must provide evidence to support his representations.
Evidence that is likely to be appropriate in relation to each of the four
representations described above might include the following (although
these are only examples and it is open to the owner to submit whatever
evidence he wishes):</p>

<p>a) copy report(s) from a quantity surveyor or structural engineer;
photographs of the condition of the building prior to the works being
carried out;</p>

<p>b) copy report(s) from a quantity surveyor or structural engineer;
photographs of the temporary arrangements;</p>

<p>c) copy quote(s) from builders’ firms of comparable experience to the
contractor that undertook the works, which indicate lower rates,
prices, expenses or profit margin;</p>

<p>d) copies of the owner’s recent bank statements for all his bank and
savings accounts; details of the value of other assets owned by the
owner and of any charges on those assets; a copy of a recent
valuation of the building to which the works were carried out; details
of any loan agreements; details of any debts and outstanding credit
card payments; details of any recent County Court judgments
against the owner; copies of company accounts.</p>

<p>Copies of previous correspondence between the owner and the authority
may also be helpful, but only if it is relevant to the above grounds.</p>

<p>It is appreciated that it may take some time to gather such evidence. It is
therefore acceptable for the owner simply to notify the Secretary of State of
the representations he wishes to make within the 28 day time limit, and to
provide full details of those representations together with supporting
evidence within 28 days of the notification. Officials acting on behalf of the
Secretary of State will consider a request for an extension of time, if there
are good reasons for it.</p>

<p>The owner should be aware that the onus in the section 55 procedure lies
on him and it is important that he provides as much relevant information to
support his representations as possible.</p>

<p>Following receipt of the owner’s representations, officials will copy them to
the authority.</p>

<p>N.B. All the owner’s representations will be copied to the authority. They
will be copied to it on the basis that they can only be used for the purposes
of the determination. This is not repeated below but this principle applies
during the whole section 55 procedure.</p>

<h3>The authority’s first representations</h3>

<p>The authority will then have the opportunity to send to the Secretary of
State its representations, responding to the owner’s representations. The
normal period for responding is 28 days from the date on which the
owner’s representations were sent to the authority.</p>

<p>Following receipt of the authority’s representations, officials will copy them
to the owner.</p>

<p>N.B. All the authority’s representations will be copied to the owner. They
will be copied to him on the basis that they can only be used for the
purposes of the determination. This is not repeated below but this
principle applies during the whole section 55 procedure.</p>

<h3>The owner’s second representations</h3>

<p>The owner will then have the opportunity to send to the Secretary of State
further representations, responding to the authority’s first set of
representations. The normal period for responding is 14 days from the
date on which the authority’s representations were sent to the owner.</p>

<p>Following receipt of the owner’s second set of representations, officials will
copy them to the authority</p>

<h3>The authority’s second representations</h3>

<p>The authority will then have the opportunity to send to the Secretary of
State further representations, responding to the owner’s second set of
representations. The normal period for responding is 14 days from the
date on which the owner’s second set of representations were sent to the
authority.</p>

<p>Following receipt of the authority’s second set of representations, officials
will copy them to the owner.</p>

<h3>Closure of representations</h3>

<p>After each party has had the opportunity to make two sets of
representations to the Secretary of State, the representations will be
closed.</p>

<p>The parties cannot make further representations to the Secretary of State,
unless they arise from information that was not known by the representing
party, and could not have been known by the representing party, prior to
the date on which the representations were closed. The Secretary of State
will not normally consider any other representations made after the close
of representations.</p>

<p>Please note that, prior to closure of representations, officials will not screen
representations to determine what is or is not relevant to the determination.
The Secretary of State will only consider what is or is not relevant once
representations have been closed. It is open to either party to represent
that evidence put forward by the other is not relevant to the determination.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>Officials may request clarification of the representations from either or both
parties. Copies of the letters of request and their responses will generally
be copied to the other party. Parties should note that the Secretary of
State’s determination will of necessity be delayed if the representations are
incomplete and clarification is required.</p>

<p>Officials may consider it necessary to instruct an expert to conduct an
inspection of the building. Both parties will be informed if this step is to be
taken, and both parties, or representatives of both parties, will be able to
attend any such inspection if they wish.</p>

<h3>Determination</h3>

<p>Once the Secretary of State is satisfied, s/he will make a determination as
to what extent the representations of the owner are justified.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State will give notice in writing to the owner and to the
authority of the determination, the reasons for it and the amount (if any)
which is recoverable.</p>

<h3>Public inquiry</h3>

<p>Whilst having the power to hold a public inquiry, the Secretary of State’s
policy is that public inquiries should only be held in exceptional
circumstances in order to determine to what extent the representations of
the owner are justified.</p>
