<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>You must include this information in your 2022 to 2023 data returns for T Level students. You can find more details in our published guidance for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individualised-learner-record-ilr">individualised learner record (ILR)</a> and autumn <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complete-the-school-census">school census</a> data collections.</p>

<h2>How to record T Levels</h2>
<p>You must record these mandatory components for every T Level programme in your data returns:</p>

<h3>T Level programme aim</h3>

<p>A programme aim is an overarching programme level learning aim that spans the whole programme and is used to calculate funding elements for the T Level programme.</p>

<p>A programme aim is recorded using the learning aim ZPROG001.</p>

<p>You must record this at the beginning of the T Level programme.</p>

<h3>T Level qualification</h3>

<p>This is the regulated qualification representing the T Level core and specialist content.</p>

<p>You must record this at the beginning of the T Level programme.</p>

<p>Search for T Level qualifications on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">find a learning aim</a> using the title “T Level technical qualification”.</p>

<p>In the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/learning-aim-reference-service-lars">Learning Aims Reference Service (LARS)</a>,  T Levels have a learning aim type of 1468 - T level technical qualification</p>

<h3>T Level occupational specialism</h3>

<p>Every student must undertake an occupational specialism as part of their T Level programme.</p>

<p>From 2021 to 2022 onwards, the occupational specialism dictates the level of funding a student attracts, so it is very important we can identify this from the data you return.</p>

<p>Each occupational specialism has a learning aim in LARS and QWS (QAN Web Services Website) starting with ZTLOS.</p>

<p>You must record this at the beginning of the T Level programme.</p>

<h3>T Level industry placement</h3>

<p>Every student must complete a substantial industry placement as part of their T Level programme.</p>

<p>Record a T Level industry placement using the learning aim ZWRKX003.</p>

<p>A work placement entity record must also be returned for the industry placement.</p>

<p>You must record this in the first or second year of the T Level programme.</p>

<h3>T Level planned hours</h3>
<p>We need to know how many hours are planned for each student for the whole programme.</p>

<p>This is different to study programmes where you record the hours planned for each academic year.</p>

<p>We have set up separate planned hours fields for T Level programmes to ensure the different methods of recording planned hours do not get confused.</p>

<h4>In the ILR</h4>

<p>Record planned hours in the planned hours (phours) field for the whole T Level programme against the T Level programme aim only.</p>

<h4>In the school census</h4>

<p>Record planned hours in the T Level planned learning hours and T Level planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours for the whole T Level programme.</p>

<h2>Coding components</h2>
<p>You must record every learning aim in a T Level programme with programme type 31. This indicates the learning aim belongs to a T Level programme.</p>

<p>Incorrect recording of components may result in incorrect programme assignments and incorrect funding.</p>

<p>You must return framework and pathway codes for T Level students in the ILR. This will ensure validation can check the occupational specialism is compatible with the chosen T level qualification, helping you ensure your data recording is accurate.</p>

<p>This check is also performed by validation on the school census in a different way as the framework and pathway structure is not part of the school census collection.</p>

<h2>Recording planned hours</h2>
<p>Recording accurate planned hours in the correct fields is crucial in ensuring accurate funding is calculated. Table 1 shows which planned hours fields should be recorded for the different programmes a 16 to 19 student can undertake.</p>

<p>Table 1</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Planned hours (Phours) / T Level planned learning hours and T Level planned employability</th>
      <th scope="col">Planned Learning Hours and Planned Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral hours</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Student only undertaking a T Level programme in the academic year</th>
      <td>Yes - hours planned for the whole programme</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Student only undertaking a study programme (including T Level Transition Programme) in the academic year</th>
      <td>No</td>

      <td>Yes - hours planned for the whole T Level programme</td>
      <td>Yes - hours planned for the academic year for the study programme only</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>T Level planned hours must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the technical qualification</li>
  <li>specialist content</li>
  <li>non-qualification activity</li>
</ul>

<p>T Level planned hours must not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maths and English delivery</li>
  <li>industry placements</li>
  <li>other qualifications that are not part of the T Level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recording the core aim</h2>

<p>T Level programmes are vocational programmes that must have a core aim.</p>

<p>For every T Level programme, the core aim must be the T Level technical qualification.</p>

<h2>Recording occupational specialisms</h2>

<p>From academic year 2022 to 2023, the occupational specialism will determine the funding band and the programme cost weighting the T Level attracts.</p>

<p>To ensure accurate funding can be calculated throughout the academic year, the occupational specialism must be recorded at the beginning of the programme.</p>

<p>In cases where a specialism has not been decided at the beginning of the T Level programme, you should record the occupational specialism that is most likely to be undertaken based on the planned programme. Should the student then start a different specialism to the one originally recorded, you should remove the original occupational specialism from the students record and record a new specialism aim that reflects the specialist activity being delivered.</p>

<p>In the ILR, when you change an occupational specialism, you must also change the pathway code for all T Level learning aims.</p>

<h2>Data migration</h2>

<p>Both the T Level technical qualification and the occupational specialism must be present in your data for each year of the programme.</p>

<p>Therefore, you must return all year 1 T Level learning aims in year 2 (and any subsequent years) until the student completes their programme.</p>

<h2>Check data accuracy</h2>
<p>To ensure the accuracy of funding allocations, in-year monitoring and reconciliation, you must ensure your T Level students are correctly recorded in your data returns.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16 to </span> 19 funding reports</h2>
<p>The 16 to 19 funding reports in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/publicdownloads/Desktop/" rel="external">funding information system, submit learner data</a> tool and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">COLLECT</a> will identify your T Level students and the funding bands assigned to them.</p>

<p>Use these reports to ensure all your T Level students are correctly reported under the correct funding bands. T Levels should come under bands 6, 7, 8 or 9.</p>

<h3>The 16 to 19 funding claim report (ILR) and 16 to 19 funded student summary report (census)</h3>

<p>These reports have separate sections for study programmes and T Levels. The second report shows the total number of T Level students and the funding bands they are assigned to according to the T Level and planned hours you have recorded.</p>

<h3>The 16 to 19 summary of funding by student (ILR)</h3>
<p>This report has a T Level student indicator, and the student detail report (census) is split into study programme and T Level sections showing you which students our calculation recognises as a T Level student based on the data you have returned.</p>

<h2>Checklist</h2>
<p>If some T Level students are not displaying as you expected, use this checklist to ensure you have recorded all programme elements correctly:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have you recorded a valid T Level qualification?</li>
  <li>Is the T Level technical qualification the core aim?</li>
  <li>Have you recorded a valid T Level occupational specialism linked to the T Level qualification?</li>
  <li>Have you recorded a programme aim (ZPROG001) spanning the delivery of all T Level components?</li>
  <li>Are all the learning aims (including the programme aim) in the T Level programme coded programme type 31 (T Level)?</li>
  <li>Is the T Level programme the latest programme recorded for the student?</li>
  <li>Have you recorded T Level hours for the whole programme (and not annually)?</li>
</ol>

<p>These are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1029995/First_examples.pdf" rel="external">some examples</a> of how T Level programme elements and scenarios should be recorded in your data returns.</p>

<h2>How to record T Level transition programmes</h2>
<p>You should only record students on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2022-to-2023">T Level transition programme</a> if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been selected to deliver T Levels</li>
  <li>confirmed they are delivering the T Level transition programme in the same T Level routes</li>
</ul>

<p>T Level transition programmes are a variant of 16 to 19 study programmes, linked to a T level route. The recording requirements are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all T Level transition programmes must have a programme aim (ZPROG001) - this must be recorded as aim type 1 (ILR only)</li>
  <li>all learning aims within a T Level transition programme should be recorded as programme type 30 (T Level transition programme)</li>
  <li>T Level transition programmes must be linked to the T Level route the student plans to progress to. To make this link, a T Level route level class code must be recorded in each T Level transition programme. There are 11 route level class codes which can be found in the Find a Learning Aim service by entering ZTPR* in the learning aim reference search box. This aim must be the core aim (aim type 5 in the ILR) of a T Level Transition Programme</li>
  <li>any other learning, including maths and English where applicable, is recorded as a component aim (aim type 3 in the ILR)</li>
  <li>as T Level transition programmes are a form of 16 to 19 study programme, you must record annual planned hours values in the Planned Learning Hours and Planned Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral Hours fields</li>
  <li>you must not record hours in the T Level Planned Hours fields (the planned hours field in the ILR and the T Level Planned Learning Hours and T Level Planned Employability, Enrichment and Pastoral Hours fields) - these fields are only used for students undertaking T Level programmes</li>
</ul>
