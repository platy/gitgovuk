<h2>Foreword by the Secretary of State for Transport</h2>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has had a terrible impact on the lives and health of many <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> citizens, as well as severe economic consequences. But it also resulted in cleaner air and quieter streets, transforming the environment in many of our towns and cities.</p>

<p>And millions of people have discovered, or rediscovered, cycling and walking. In some places, the initial lockdown period saw a 70% rise in the number of people on bikes - for exercise, or for safe, socially distanced travel.</p>

<p>We need people to carry on cycling, and to be joined by millions more , particularly while public transport capacity is still reduced.</p>

<p>We also know that in the new world, pedestrians will need more space. Indications are that there is a significant link between COVID-19 recovery and fitness. Active travel can help us become more resilient.</p>

<p>That is why towns and cities in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and around the world have made radical changes to their roads to accommodate active travel.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics" class="govuk-link">National Travel Survey</a>, in 2017-18 over 40% of urban journeys were under 2 miles – perfectly suited to walking and cycling.</p>

<p>Active travel is affordable, delivers significant health benefits, has been shown to improve well-being, mitigates congestion, improves air quality and has no carbon emissions at the point of use. Towns and cities based around active travel will have happier and healthier citizens as well as lasting local economic benefits. In July we published ‘Gear Change: A Bold vision for cycling and walking’, which set out a range of commitments to increase levels of active travel. Reallocating road space is very much part of that vision.</p>

<p>The government therefore expects local authorities to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians. Such changes will help embed altered behaviours and demonstrate the positive effects of active travel. I’m pleased to see that many authorities have already begun to do this, and I urge you all to consider how you can begin to make use of the tools in this guidance, to make sure you do what is necessary to ensure transport networks support recovery from the COVID-19 emergency and provide a lasting legacy of greener, safer transport.</p>

<p>Grant Shapps<br>
Secretary of State for Transport</p>

<h2>Network management duty guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance is additional statutory guidance issued by the Secretary of State for Transport under Section 18 of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/contents" class="govuk-link">Traffic Management Act 2004 (“the act”)</a>.</p>

<p>It applies to all highway authorities in England, who shall have regard to this guidance to deliver their network management duty under the act. It is effective from the date of publication and replaces the guidance published on 9 May 2020, and updated on 23 May 2020.</p>

<p>It does not replace the original <a rel="external" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/tmaportal/tmafeatures/tmapart2/tmafeaturespart2.pdf" class="govuk-link">Network Management Duty Guidance</a> published in November 2004, but provides additional advice on techniques for managing roads to deal with COVID-19 response related issues.</p>

<p>The guidance sets out high-level principles to help local authorities to manage their roads and what actions they should take.</p>

<h2>Reallocating road space: measures</h2>

<p>Local authorities in areas with high levels of public transport use should take measures to reallocate road space to people walking and cycling, both to encourage active travel and to enable social distancing during restart (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing-after-4-july" class="govuk-link">social distancing in this context primarily refers to the need for people to stay 2 metres apart where possible when outdoors</a>. Local authorities where public transport use is low should be considering all possible measures.</p>

<p>Measures should be taken as swiftly as possible, but not at the expense of consulting local communities. Any measures for cycling should be designed to meet the requirements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-infrastructure-design-ltn-120">Local Transport Note 1/20: Cycle infrastructure design (LTN 1/20)</a>. The summary principles contained in LTN 1/20 should be followed as far as possible to implement safe cycling schemes for people of all abilities, including disabled cyclists.</p>

<p>None of these measures are new – they are interventions that are a standard part of the traffic management toolkit, but a step-change in their roll-out is needed to maintain a green recovery. They include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Installing cycle facilities with a minimum level of physical separation from volume traffic; for example, mandatory cycle lanes, using light segregation features such as flexible plastic wands; or converting traffic lanes into cycle lanes (suspending parking bays where necessary); widening existing cycle lanes to enable cyclists to maintain distancing. Facilities should be segregated as far as possible, i.e. with physical measures separating cyclists and other traffic. Lanes indicated by road markings only are very unlikely to be sufficient to deliver the level of change needed, especially in the longer term.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encouraging walking and cycling to school, for example through the introduction of more ‘school streets’. These are areas around schools where motor traffic is restricted at pick-up and drop-off times, during term-time. They can be effective in encouraging more walking and cycling, particularly where good facilities exist on routes to the school and where the parents, children and school are involved as part of the scheme development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reducing speed limits: 20mph speed limits are being more widely adopted as an appropriate speed limit for residential roads, and many through streets in built-up areas. 20mph limits alone will not be sufficient to meet the needs of active travel, but in association with other measures, reducing the speed limit can provide a more attractive and safer environment for walking and cycling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introducing pedestrian and cycle zones: restricting access for motor vehicles at certain times (or at all times) to specific streets, or networks of streets, particularly town centres and high streets. This will enable active travel but also social distancing in places where people are likely to gather.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modal filters (also known as filtered permeability); closing roads to motor traffic, for example by using planters or large barriers. Often used in residential areas, when designed and delivered well, this can create low-traffic or traffic-free neighbourhoods leading to a more pleasant environment that encourages people to walk and cycle, and improving safety.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing additional cycle parking facilities at key locations, such as outside stations and in high streets, to accommodate an increase in cycling, for example by repurposing parking bays to accommodate cycle racks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes to junction design to accommodate more cyclists, as set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-infrastructure-design-ltn-120" class="govuk-link">LTN 1/20</a> – for example, low-level cycle signals, new forms of signal control such as ‘hold the left turn’ and two-stage turns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Whole-route’ approaches to create corridors for buses, cycles and access only on key routes into town and city centres.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identifying and bringing forward permanent schemes already planned, for example under Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans, and that can be constructed relatively quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Changes to social distancing requirements may mean temporarily widened footways are no longer needed in many places, and authorities should consider removing these and reinstating the original road layout, including any parking bays. However, the potential to encourage walking through more permanent changes should be carefully considered. As more people begin to return to shops, offices, and other destinations, space may still be needed for people to move about safely. Local lockdowns may also require social distancing measures to be reinstated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Space at bus stops will still be needed to allow people to queue and socially distance; along with widened pedestrian refuges and crossings (both formal and informal) to enable people to cross roads safely and at a distance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Other considerations</h2>

<p>All these measures can be introduced temporarily, either in isolation or as a combined package of measures. Some interventions, including new lightly-segregated cycle lanes, will not require Traffic Regulation Orders (<abbr title="Traffic Regulation Orders">TROs</abbr>). Others will require <abbr title="Traffic Regulation Orders">TROs</abbr>, of which there are different types. The main ones are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Permanent: this process includes prior consultation on the proposed scheme design, a 21-day notice period for statutory consultees and others who can log objections; there can be a public inquiry in some circumstances.</li>
  <li>Experimental: these are used to trial schemes that may then be made permanent.  Authorities must put in place monitoring arrangements, and carry out ongoing consultation once the measure is built. Although the initial implementation period can be quick, local residents and businesses should still be given an opportunity to comment on proposed changes, and the need for extra monitoring and consultation afterwards can make them a more onerous process overall. Schemes installed using experimental orders are subject to a requirement for ongoing consultation for 6 months once in place, with statutory consultees including bus operators, emergency services and freight industry representatives.  This consultation allows a trial scheme to be adjusted in the light of experience and feedback, which can lead to a better scheme overall. Schemes should be monitored and evaluated to help make decisions as to whether the scheme should be made permanent, and if so in what form.</li>
  <li>Temporary: these can be in place for up to 18 months.  There is a 7-day notice period prior to making the <abbr title="Traffic Regulation Order">TRO</abbr> and a 14-day notification requirement after it is made, plus publicity requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergency legislation came into force on 23 May 2020 to temporarily amend the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/536/regulation/2/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">The Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Procedure Regulations 1992</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/536/regulation/3/made">The Local Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Procedure) (England and Wales) Regulations 1996</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/536/regulation/4/made">The Secretary of State’s Traffic Order (Procedure) (England and Wales) Regulations 1990</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The amendments introduce an emergency procedure for the making of temporary traffic orders. The main change is to the means of advertising the order, which can be via digital means. Once the order has been made, a second notice still needs to be published for information within 14 days. This is via a newspaper, where these are available, or via digital means if it is not reasonably practicable to publish in a newspaper.</p>

<p>The amendments also allow, for non-emergency temporary, permanent and experimental orders, alternative publicity arrangements to help deal with some practical difficulties that have arisen as a result of restrictions that are in place. For example, these might be where local newspapers have closed or have moved publications on-line or local authority offices are closed to the public, and there are concerns about the safety of staff posting site notices in some circumstances.  The amendments will cease to have effect as of 30 April 2021.</p>

</ul>

<p>This legislation did not change any of the current notice periods. For temporary traffic orders, whether made using the emergency procedure or not, councils are still required to give 7 days’ notice of proposed changes to allow time for local residents or businesses to send in any comments or objections. A second notice must be published within 14 days of making the order. It is also recommended that authorities consult local residents and businesses at the design stage to ensure schemes will not have unintended consequences.</p>

<p><abbr title="Traffic Regulation Orders">TROs</abbr> may include or exempt vehicular traffic of any class specified in the order. Authorities should consider exempting from restrictions vehicles that deliver essential services and that are easily identifiable for enforcement purposes. For example, these may include emergency service vehicles, Royal Mail vehicles as a Universal Postal Service provider, and contracted rubbish collection vehicles. Exempt vehicles are not always indicated on the associated traffic signing, hence the need for them to be easily identifiable to ensure enforcement action is not taken against them.</p>

<p>Traffic signs may be needed to inform pedestrians, cyclists and drivers of changes to road layouts, particularly where temporary widening is in place. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884008/covid-19-temporary-signs-for-pedestrians-drivers-and-cyclists.pdf">Designs for temporary signs are published alongside this guidance</a>. These are covered by the provisions of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-signs-regulations-and-general-directions-2016-an-overview" class="govuk-link">Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016</a> and as such do not need special signs authorisation from the department.</p>

<p>Authorities should monitor and evaluate any temporary measures they install, with a view to making them permanent, and embedding a long-term shift to active travel as we move from restart to recovery.</p>

<p>Access will still be required for other activities in the road, particularly street works, maintenance and other highway works, which will need to be balanced with work to reallocate road space to active travel. Street works and maintenance activity must continue to be permitted, as they will be essential to getting the economy going again and maintenance works cannot be delayed indefinitely. Utilities need to continue to be able to access their infrastructure so, for example, concrete planters that cannot be moved should not be placed over underground apparatus. Use of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-and-use-roadworks-data" class="govuk-link">Street Manager digital service</a> will help to plan and co-ordinate works.</p>

<p>Depending on the measures they are installing, authorities will also need to consider access for Blue Badge holders, (including parking and safe access to the kerb at sufficient locations to enable access, to pick up and drop off badge holders, including taxi services), deliveries and other essential services as appropriate.</p>

<p>Any changes to Blue Badge parking provision need to be carefully considered and local groups representing disabled people should be consulted. If cycling and walking schemes require bays to be moved, alternatives should be provided such as relocating bays elsewhere nearby, bearing in mind the need for such bays to be close to shops and services.</p>

<h2>Engagement and consultation</h2>

<p>When implementing these changes, authorities need to consider the impact on all road users, taking into account the need to provide for increased walking and cycling. Different types of intervention will be appropriate in different areas of the country. For example, what is appropriate in urban areas (including market towns) may not be suitable in more rural areas where a large proportion of journeys are too long to be made on foot or by cycle, and people are more reliant on private vehicles.</p>

<p>As set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-infrastructure-design-ltn-120" class="govuk-link">Local Transport Note 1/20: Cycle Infrastructure Design</a>, effective engagement with the local community, particularly at an early stage, is essential to ensuring the political and public acceptance of any scheme. The department advises engagement as good practice even where there is no legal requirement to do so for the measures being proposed.</p>

<p>Authorities should seek input from stakeholders during the design phase of any scheme, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local chiefs of police and emergency services must be consulted to ensure access is maintained where needed, for example, to roads that are closed to motor traffic.</li>
  <li>Local businesses, including Business Improvement Districts, those based on local high streets and those that are temporarily closed, should be informed and given an opportunity to comment to ensure proposals meet their needs. The need for kerbside access for deliveries and servicing should be taken into account and balanced against the need to provide protected space for walking and cycling, for example through the use of floating loading bays.</li>
  <li>Royal Mail, to ensure that access can be maintained to post boxes and to premises for collections and deliveries, to enable them to meet their legal obligations to deliver a universal postal service.</li>
  <li>Local disability groups should be consulted at an early stage of scheme development – see paragraph 24. Any online engagement or consultation materials should comply with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 to ensure they are accessible to disabled people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Engagement should include publicity and on-street information warning of forthcoming changes to road layouts so that drivers are aware of them and can adjust their route and future journeys if necessary. Digital map providers should also be informed of changes, so that satellite navigation software is updated promptly, to avoid drivers being given a route that is closed to them. This will also assist delivery and logistics drivers to re-plan routes in advance and avoid unnecessary delays.</p>

<p>Accessibility requirements apply to all measures, both temporary and permanent. The Public Sector Equality Duty still applies, and in making any changes to their road networks, authorities must ensure that elements of a scheme do not discriminate, directly or indirectly, and must consider their duty to make reasonable adjustments anticipating the needs of those with protected characteristics, for example by carrying out Equality Impact Assessments on proposed schemes. Engagement with groups representing disabled people and others with protected characteristics should be carried out at an early stage of scheme development.</p>

<p>Visually impaired people, particularly, may find navigating through changed layouts difficult if they are not thought through at the design and consultation stage. Guide Dogs, RNIB, the Thomas Pocklington Trust and Visionary have jointly produced a <a rel="external" href="https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/research/Policy-and-guidance-for-businesses/street-design-guidance-for-local-authorities" class="govuk-link">guidance document for local authorities which provides advice on designing temporary measures for visually impaired people</a>.</p>
