<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This user guide is designed to be a useful reference guide with explanatory notes on the issues and classifications that are key to the production and presentation of the Home Office’s annual statistical release of “Police Funding for England &amp; Wales”.</p>

<p>Police Funding Statistics are published on an annual basis every July. Each publication and accompanying data tables can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-funding-for-england-and-wales-statistics">Police Funding for England and Wales Statistics collection page</a>.</p>

<p>The dates of future editions of these statistics are pre-announced and can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics?content_store_document_type=upcoming_statistics">Statistics release calendar</a>.</p>

<p>This user guide looks to communicate any data quality considerations in the interpretation of the statistics, however, it does not intend to evaluate the quality of the police funding settlement process or the police funding formula itself.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-funding-for-england-and-wales-2015-to-2022.">Police Funding: England and Wales 2015 to 2022</a> in July 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-daniel-shaw-national-statistics-designation-for-police-funding-for-england-and-wales-statistics/" rel="external">the Office for Statistics Regulation (<abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr>) wrote to the Home Office confirming their designation of National Statistics</a>. This followed an <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> assessment of compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> on these statistics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Scope of the statistics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> What’s included in the statistics</h3>

<p>The Home Office is responsible for the 43 territorial police forces of England and Wales, each of which is governed by a local policing body(typically a Police and Crime Commissioner)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, elected by the local population. Policing in Scotland and in Northern Ireland is devolved and is the responsibility of the Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive. The information contained in this publication relates only to policing in England and Wales.</p>

<p>This bulletin and the figures reported reflect the main elements of police funding as budgeted in the agreed police funding settlement (as described in section 2.2 below), plus any significant in-year funding announced after the settlement had been agreed. The funding  here <strong>does not constitute the whole budget for policing</strong> either in a particular Police Force area, overall, or for the National Crime Agency (<abbr title="National Crime Agency">NCA</abbr>). Nor does it reflect the actual amount of money spent by the Government on policing in any given financial year.</p>

<p>The publication and data tables include a detailed breakdown of police funding for the years the financial year ending March 2016 to the financial year ending March 2023. High level figures for the years between the financial year ending March 2011 and the financial year ending March 2015 are included in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1089019/police-funding-england-and-wales-2015-to-2023-tables.ods" rel="external">table 4</a>, however, extreme caution must be applied when comparing these figures with figures for later years. For a number of reasons set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-police-funding-before-financial-year-ending-march-2016">Annex B</a> of this user guide, it is difficult to compare current total police funding levels with years before the financial year ending March 2016 due to changes in the structure of police funding over the period.</p>

<p>All figures in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1089019/police-funding-england-and-wales-2015-to-2023-tables.ods" rel="external">accompanying data tables</a> are presented in both nominal and real terms, <a class="govuk-link" href="#real-terms-comparisons">see chapter 6</a> of this user guide for information on real terms comparisons.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Essential components of police funding</h3>

<p>The structure of Government funding for policing is set at Spending Reviews (where the Government determines how it will fund public services over several years), whilst the detail is outlined and agreed annually at the police funding settlement. The majority of public funding for the police forces in England and Wales is provided by the Home Office and is agreed by the UK Parliament on an annual basis, known as the police funding settlement. The police funding settlement consists of the funding set out in the Written Ministerial Statement and the Police Grant Report. Individual funding streams and the source of this funding are summarised in figure 1 and described in full in this section.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1: Main components and sources of police funding</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/155899/police-funding-ew-15-23-user-guide-01.png"></div></figure>

<p>Typically, the Home Office publishes a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/provisional-police-grant-allocations-2022-to-2023">Provisional Police Grant Report</a> each year, which contains grant funding allocations for the following year to be paid out under the Police Act 1996. This is subject to a public consultation before a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-grants-in-england-and-wales-2022-to-2023">Final Police Grant Report</a> is published and voted on by Parliament.</p>

<p>The Home Office accompanies publication of each Police Grant Report with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-02-02/hcws577" rel="external">Written Ministerial Statement</a> providing context and further information on funding not set out through the Police Grant Report. This includes police funding paid by the Welsh Government and Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities(<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>); funding for national policing priorities (also termed as reallocations); police capital funding; counter-terrorism police funding; and Council Tax precept.</p>

<p>In addition to Government funding, Police and Crime Commissioners (<abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>) set a local police precept which is part of Council Tax. Police precept accounts for around 34 percent of the funding <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> receive and is paid directly to collecting authorities by local taxpayers. The level of the police precept for the following year is set by each <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioner">PCC</abbr> by 1 March. Each year <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> set referendum principles for <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> in England which set out the level of increase in Band D bill level above which a local referendum must be held (more information on local referendums can be found here <a class="govuk-link" href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn05682/" rel="external">Council tax: local referendums - House of Commons Library (parliament.uk)</a>). Council Tax in Wales is a devolved matter. In Wales, local authorities are responsible for the setting, collection and enforcement of Council Tax. <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> in Wales are not subject to the referendum principles which apply in England, when setting their Council Tax Band D bill levels.</p>

<p>In addition to these main sources of funding, <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> also receive income from other sources. These include: charging for special police services (<abbr title="Special Police Services">SPS</abbr>) (for example providing police officers at football matches, festivals, concerts and other events where they have been requested to do so by the event organiser) to recover costs; the provision of services such as training; and income from donations and sponsorship. <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> also hold financial reserves. This funding is outside the scope of these statistics.</p>

<p>The wider policing structure includes a number of law enforcement bodies which are partly funded from the police funding settlement and are only within the scope of this publication in this respect. These include the Independent Office for Police Conduct (<abbr title="Independent Office for Police Conduct">IOPC</abbr>), which investigates complaints about the police; Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (<abbr title="Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services">HMICFRS</abbr>), which is responsible for inspection; and the National Crime Agency (<abbr title="National Crime Agency">NCA</abbr>), which is a Non-Ministerial Department. Police forces participate in Regional Organised Crime Units, which are largely funded out of <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>’ budgets but which also receive Home Office grant partly funded from police settlement funding for national priorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Reason for publication</h3>

<p>The UK Statistics Authority has previously noted that arrangements for police funding are complicated and has recommended that the Home Office publish a regular analysis of police funding in line with the principles set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Following this recommendation, the Home Office now publishes this document to provide a single source of statistical information on police funding levels in the recent period and the context for earlier periods. This publication is intended to help to inform debates on police funding by providing a single authoritative source of facts.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/assessment-report-police-funding-for-england-and-wales-statistics/" rel="external">In 2021, the Office for Statistics Regulation (<abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr>) conducted an assessment of compliance against the standards set out in the Code of Practices for Statistics</a>. The assessment was positive in its view that the statistics are important for public accountability and that users find the statistics provide more transparency than previously. However, it also recommended several presentational changes to add further public value. These changes have been incorporated into the publication from the July 2021 publication onwards.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-daniel-shaw-national-statistics-designation-for-police-funding-for-england-and-wales-statistics/" rel="external">The <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> has since confirmed the designation of these statistics as National Statistics</a>. This means that these statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, impartiality, quality and public value, and are fully compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Data quality</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Sources of data</h3>

<p>These statistics draw on data from a number of sources. The majority of the figures contained in the publication are available in the public domain ahead of this publication.</p>

<p>As described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#scope-of-the-statistics">chapter 2</a> above, Government funding to <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>, Government budgeted spend on national priorities and police capital spend are agreed as a part of the annual police funding settlement. The data underpinning the settlement is held and managed by the Police Funding Policy team within Home Office.</p>

<p>This information is considered admin data, i.e. data that are collected for administrative or operational purposes, with statistical use being a secondary purpose. The primary purpose of this dataset is calculating the annual settlement as well as generating data tables for the Written Ministerial Statement and Police Grant Report ahead of the Parliamentary vote. Calculations are carried out in a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet, from which the tables in these statistical publications are partially derived.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, information on Council Tax precept received by <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> is collected and published as National Statistics by <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government, in their publications <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/council-tax-statistics">Council Tax levels set by local authorities in England</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/council-tax-levels" rel="external">Council Tax Levels in Wales</a> respectively. <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government collect this information from all precepting authorities through annual data returns issued using legislative powers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Quality assurance of the data</h3>

<p>The data undergoes rigorous quality assurance serving its operational purpose in supporting the police funding settlement as well as during the production of these statistics.</p>

<p>During its operational use by the Police Funding Policy team to inform the proposal and agreement of the police funding settlement, the team implement a number of manual and automated checks on the underlying data they hold within the police funding settlement spreadsheet. The team have adopted principles based on the Office for Budget Responsibility best practice methods for publishing data relating to funding. The spreadsheet is also independently audited outside the team, with each completed check documented in a checklist.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government both include information about the quality assurance of their Council Tax data in their respective technical notes accompanying their statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1064277/Council_Tax_Levels_Set_by_Local_Authorities_in_England_2022-23_-_Technical_Notes.pdf" rel="external">Council Tax levels set by local authorities in England statistics technical notes</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/statistics-and-research/2021-01/local-government-finance-statistics-quality-report.pdf" rel="external">Council Tax in Wales statistics quality report</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both the <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government statistics have achieved National Statistics Status, demonstrating they meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and value. The Home Office maintains a close working relationship with <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government throughout the police funding settlement cycle and in the production of these statistics, with the Home Office featuring on the 24 hour pre-release list for the <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> statistics.</p>

<p>Upon compiling the data tables for the police funding statistics, further validation is carried out. Figures are checked against those published in the Police Grant Report to ensure consistency between documents. Checks for internal consistency between tables are carried out, and aggregated totals are checked for consistency with previous years. Variance checks are carried out to ensure that any large year on year changes can be explained. Where there have been in-year adjustments (or other funding announced outside of the usual police funding settlement) process some manual input may be required. The team work closely with relevant policy leads to ensure this is carried out correctly and consistently with previous years, limiting the risk of manual input error or double counting. The source of the manual adjustments are documented by the team to ensure a clear audit trail.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government precept data is also sense checked against estimated precept increases calculated during the settlement process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Limitations of the data</h3>

<p>These statistics look to reflect the level of funding as budgeted in the police funding settlement and voted on in Parliament. As comprehensive checks are undertaken to ensure consistency with the figures published in the agreed funding settlement, the risk of errors is low. However there a number of limitations to the data that we have identified.</p>

<h4>Changes to police funding structure</h4>

<p>The structure of police funding is complex and is subject to frequent change and review. When these statistics are compiled, effort is taken to ensure consistency in aggregated totals to allow for year-on-year comparison. Where this is not possible we aim to provide appropriate caveats to highlight the reasons why to users. For example, <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-police-funding-before-financial-year-ending-march-2016">Annex B</a> of this user guide describes the changes to police funding which make comparison before the financial year ending March 2016 difficult. Whilst this user guide and footnotes in accompanying data tables provide a summary of these changes, this is not an exhaustive list and other changes may impact on year-on-year comparability.</p>

<h4>Rounding</h4>

<p>During the calculation of the police funding settlement, data is input from a number of different sources, including from internal Home Office budgets, HM Treasury, <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government. Whilst an effort is made to ensure numbers are unrounded (or rounded to the nearest pound), in some cases figures are only provided in a rounded format (such as to the nearest one hundred thousand). Therefore <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1089019/police-funding-england-and-wales-2015-to-2023-tables.ods" rel="external">table 1</a> contains a mixture of rounded and unrounded numbers. Particular caution should be taken when making comparisons where the change is relatively small as such changes could be due, to some extent, to rounding differences.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators</h4>

<p>Real terms comparisons made in this publication are calculated using the latest published <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators. As this publication is forward looking, the forecast <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators for the year ahead are used which are subject to change and revision. For further information, <a class="govuk-link" href="#real-terms-comparisons">see chapter 6</a> of this user guide.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> QAAD framework</h3>

<p>For the purpose of this publication, we consider the data underpinning the police funding settlement held and managed by the Police Funding Policy team within Home Office to be administrative data. We have therefore applied the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/" rel="external">QAAD (Quality Assurance of Administrative Data) framework</a> to assess our processes in receiving and publishing admin data.</p>

<p>Through the framework we have identified the publication to be of medium public profile. While police funding attracts a lot of external interest, the figures in this release are not new, and have already been published in the Written Ministerial Statement and Police Grant report. This release simply brings all figures together in one place.</p>

<p>The statistics aim to convey an accurate view of the levels of funding agreed in the Police Funding Settlement, published and voted on in Parliament each year. <strong>This QAAD review does not aim to reflect the risk of quality concern in settlement process itself</strong>. As such, we consider the police funding statistics to carry a low risk of quality concern as the information can be easily validated against published material. The close involvement of the Home Office Police Funding Policy team, as data supply partner, in the production of these statistics further limit the risk of any quality concerns.</p>

<p>The medium public profile coupled with low risk of quality concerns mean we have therefore determined basic (A1) or enhanced (A2) assurance to be a sufficient level of assurance required for these statistics. To demonstrate this level of assurance we have used this user guide to provide information about the context in which this data is collected, information on the collaboration between data supplier and statistics producer, quality assurance principles we have applied, limitations of the data and the likely degree of risk to the quality of the admin data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Uses of the data</h3>

<p>The statistics produced in the series are used by a range of users to monitor trends in the police funding in England and Wales. Specific uses of the data are listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Informing political debate –</strong> the statistics are used within Parliamentary debate, providing a comparable view of changes to police funding over time. Information on the statistics is routinely requested in Parliamentary Questions. The data is also used by Police and Crime Commissioners and independent think tanks to scrutinise the funding process.</p>

<p><strong>Policy making and monitoring –</strong> the statistics are used by policy areas to monitor the state of the police workforce.</p>

<p><strong>Informing the general public –</strong> the data is also used by members of the public and is routinely provided in response to Freedom of Information requests.</p>

<p><strong>Third parties –</strong> the statistics are used by a range of third parties, including factcheckers, independent think tanks and academics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Ongoing user engagement</h3>

<p>The Home Office aims to engage with users on a continuous, ad hoc basis, to ensure that the statistics remain as relevant as possible. Following the <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr>’s assessment of the statistics in 2021, a number of users provided feedback. Some examples of the subsequent changes made to the publication are listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Real terms data</strong></p>

<p>Users told the <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> that presenting funding changes only in nominal prices did not help provide an understanding of the effects of inflation on police funding. Since July 2021 we have published real-terms as well as nominal prices to provide greater understanding of the effects of inflation on police funding. For more information on real terms comparisons, please <a class="govuk-link" href="#real-terms-comparisons">see chapter 6</a> of this user guide.</p>

<p><strong>Data back to 2010</strong></p>

<p>Users highlighted that the value of the statistics would be enhanced if the time series went back to 2010, like other related statistics, such as <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s Local Authority revenue expenditure and financing England statistics. There are a number of difficulties in making valid comparisons with data prior to the financial year ending March 2016 <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-police-funding-before-financial-year-ending-march-2016">Annex B</a>, however, since July 2021 a high – level overall funding figure back to the financial year ending March 2011 has been provided. For more information on difficulties making comparisons with historic data, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-police-funding-before-financial-year-ending-march-2016">Annex B</a> of this user guide.</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness of the statistics</strong></p>

<p>User feedback identified that some users felt the timeliness of the publication could be improved. Some users also said it would be useful to provide more information about the events that take place prior to the production of the statistics. Since July 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-key-stages-in-the-production-of-the-statistical-release">Annex A</a> of this user guide has been included to explain the current process in place to agree police funding and to produce the statistics whilst directing users to further background material.</p>

<span class="number">4.3 </span> Feedback and enquiries</h3>

<p>To expand on the work started as a part of the <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> assessment of these statistics, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.homeofficesurveys.homeoffice.gov.uk/s/UFY33W/" rel="external">we have launched a user engagement survey for 2022</a> to help shape future publications of these statistics.</p>

<p>We aim to use this opportunity to identify further current uses and users of the data as well as provide a chance for users to give their suggestions on how the publication can better meet their needs. Whilst the survey will be anonymous by default, we encourage regular users who are interested in establishing an ongoing dialogue with the Home Office to provide their contact details when prompted.</p>

Part of the grant was awarded to forces whilst the remainder was allocated to support the Home Office and National Police Chiefs’ Council’s Police Uplift Programme. Announced as part of the financial year ending March 2021 Police Funding Settlement, a ringfenced grant associated with the recruitment of new officers as part of the first year of the Police Uplift Programme was created. For the financial year ending March 2022, £100 million has been ringfenced (with the remaining PUP investment included within core grant funding to <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>), force allocations will be released for costs incurred in meeting their recruitment target for the year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Real terms comparisons</h2>

<p>Following user feedback received as a part of <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> assessment of the statistics, real terms comparisons were included from the July 2021 publication onwards. Calculations have been carried out using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gdp-deflators-at-market-prices-and-money-gdp"><abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators, national statistics published quarterly by HM Treasury</a>.</p>

<p>As police funding statistics are forward looking, the <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators used are based on Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts of the <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflator for the budget year. The <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators used in this publication reflect the most up-to-date data available at time of publication (typically the June deflators). Real terms police funding figures will not be revised based on quarterly changes to <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators, so users should ensure they are using the most appropriate deflator. This is particularly significant where there is likely to be unusual levels of volatility in <abbr title="Office for Budget Responsibility">OBR</abbr> forecasts of <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Police force and regional breakdowns</h2>

<p>Government and precept funding provided to <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> is included by Police Force in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1089019/police-funding-england-and-wales-2015-to-2023-tables.ods" rel="external">Table 3</a> accompanying the publication. This includes core funding, Council Tax grants, <abbr title="National and International Capital City">NICC</abbr> grants, pensions grants, Police Uplift Programme grants, Council Tax precept and the police capital grant.</p>

<p>To allow for easier regional comparison, these have also been aggregated to include NUTS level 1 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) totals (Follow the link for further details <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/programmesandprojects/europeancitystatistics" rel="external">International, regional and city statistics - Office for National Statistics (ons.gov.uk)</a>).
Funding for national priorities, Serious Violence funding, counter terrorism funding and additional capital funding (not including the police capital grant) are budgeted at a national level and as such, police force or regional breakdowns cannot be derived.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Key stages in the production of the statistical release</h2>

<p>During the review of the statistics by <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> in 2021, user feedback identified that some users felt the timeliness of the publication could be improved. Some users also said it would be useful to provide more information about the events that take place prior to the production of the statistics.</p>

<p>This annex has been included to explain the current process in place to agree police funding and produce the statistics whilst directing users to further background material. As this publication relies on the publication of several other documents there are a number of constraints this places on the timeliness of these statistics, such as the publication of precept figures in April and the publication of updated <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators in late June or early July. We continue to review the timing of these statistics each year. Figure 2 summarises each of the stages described in full in this section.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Timeline summarising the key stages in producing this statistical release</strong></p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/155900/police-funding-ew-15-23-user-guide-02.png"></div></figure>

<h4>A. The Police Funding Settlement cycle</h4>

<p>Most figures in this publication are agreed as a part of the annual police funding settlement. As such, many of the numbers included in the release are available in the public domain prior to publication.</p>

<p>The police funding settlement period begins each September with the preparation of a provisional settlement. Spending Review figures are agreed with Her Majesty’s Treasury setting the total law enforcement envelope.</p>

<p>The Home Office proposes any funding for national policing priorities (as known as reallocations).</p>

<p>The remaining funds are distributed between police forces using pre-established distributions specific to each funding stream. The core Home Office grant for example is allocated using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-the-police-allocation-formula">the Police Allocation Formula (PAF)</a>. The Home Office also works closely with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>) and the Welsh Government on the distribution of specific grants such as <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> Council Tax grants.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/provisional-police-grant-allocations-2022-to-2023">provisional police grant report</a> and accompanying <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-12-16/hcws503" rel="external">Written Ministerial Statement</a> are published in December, outlining these above figures as well as providing further background information on the calculation and distribution of specific grants.</p>

<p>Typically, a four-week consultation period between December and January gives the sector time to feedback on the provisional settlement.</p>

<p>Following this consultation, a final settlement is published each February in the form of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-grants-in-england-and-wales-2022-to-2023">final Police Grant Report</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-02-02/hcws577" rel="external">Written Ministerial Statement</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/police-finance">The latest version of all of the above documents alongside publications for previous years can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h4>B. Collecting precept data and making in-year adjustments</h4>

<p>Throughout the funding settlement period, Home Office estimates the amount of Council Tax precept that each police force will collect. This is based on the maximum allowable increase applied to precepting authorities. These figures are published in the tables accompanying the Written Ministerial Statements.</p>

<p>For these statistics, <strong>actual precept</strong> funding is instead used. Figures for England are published each March or April by <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> as a part of their statistical release <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/council-tax-statistics">Council Tax levels set by local authorities in England</a>. Similarly figures for Welsh forces are published by the Welsh Government in their publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/council-tax-levels" rel="external">Council Tax levels in Wales</a>.</p>

<p>Between April and May any “in-year adjustments” are considered, including any commitments to Police funding made outside of the usual police settlement period. For example, the publication for financial year ending March 2022 included additional COVID-19 support for the previous year, final allocations confirmed after the publication police grant report.</p>

<h4>C. Preparing the statistics and quality assurance</h4>

<p>The preparation and production of these statistics is a collaborative exercise between the Home Office Police Funding Policy (who also lead on the police funding settlement) and Home Office Police Statistics teams.</p>

<p>A kick-off meeting is held in April and a publication plan is prepared, containing all specific tasks, milestones and staff allocated to them. A publication date is agreed and pre-announced on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Following the publication of the police funding settlement, the publication of precept figures and the confirmation of any in-year adjustments, the Home Office police funding team compile the data for the statistical publication in May and June.</p>

<p>The funding team complete a series of quality assurance checks, including ensuring consistency with previous years, ensuring consistency with figures published in the police funding settlement and verifying figures with other Home Office policy leads.  The team also complete sense checks on the <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and Welsh Government precept data to ensure they are within the expected ranges of the projections calculated as a part of the police funding settlement.</p>

<p>Data is then shared with the Police Statistics team who conduct a series of validation and variation checks including ensuring clear explanations of any significant changes in funding are explained.</p>

<h4>D. Production of the statistics and publication</h4>

<p>Once quality assurance is completed, preparation of draft data tables, charts, commentary, and the user guide begin in June.</p>

<p>Real terms comparisons cannot be produced until the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gdp-deflators-at-market-prices-and-money-gdp">publication of updated <abbr title="Gross Domestic Product">GDP</abbr> deflators by HMT in late June or early July</a>.</p>

<p>Tables, commentary and the user guide are then circulated for further quality assurance 2 weeks ahead of publication.</p>

<p>Statistics and accompanying documentation are sent for preparation of HTML web pages 1 week ahead of publication.</p>

<p>The commentary, tables, charts and statistics news release are circulated 24 hours before publication to a nominated list of people (including ministers and press office) as shown on pre-release access list.</p>

<h4>E. Follow-up work</h4>

<p>A wash-up meeting is held on process of publication where actions are agreed for next year and lessons learned recorded.</p>

<p>Any user feedback is also reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>The published dataset is used for Parliamentary Questions, Freedom of Information and other enquiries (until following publication).</p>

<h2>Annex B: Police funding before financial year ending March 2016</h2>

<p>It is difficult to make direct comparisons between current police funding figures and those in the years prior to the financial year ending March 2016 due to a number of significant changes in the structure of police funding and policing over the period.</p>

<p>The Government regularly reviews how it will fund public services in the years ahead in exercises known as Spending Reviews. As a result of these reviews, the structure of police funding can change significantly with specific programmes or policing bodies moving between being funding from within or outside the police funding settlement announced each year to Parliament. It is therefore not easy to make valid comparisons of police funding from one spending review period to the next.</p>

<p>Breakdowns of individual funding streams prior to the year ending March 2016 are therefore not included in this publication. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1089019/police-funding-england-and-wales-2015-to-2023-tables.ods" rel="external">Table 4</a> provides a high-level view of total annual funding since the financial year ending March 2011. Whilst effort has been made to maximise comparability, consideration should be given to the changes in funding structure when making comparisons.</p>

<p>This section provides information on the key changes to the structure of police funding and of policing and should not be taken as a comprehensive list of all changes to different parts of the system since 1995.  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900020/police-funding-england-and-wales-2015-to-2021-annex3.pdf" rel="external">Annex 3 of the publication for the financial year ending 2021</a> provided an overview of the key national law enforcement bodies from 1996 onwards.</p>

<h4>Police governance</h4>

<p>Directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners (<abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>) were introduced in 2012 and are responsible for ensuring an effective and efficient police force and delivery of community safety and crime reduction in their area. <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> replaced Police Authorities which had existed since 1964. <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> in Wales receive part of their core grant funding from the Welsh Government. Additionally, Council Tax is devolved in Wales and the Welsh Government has policy responsibility for the police precept element of police funding in Wales. The Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (<abbr title="Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime">MOPAC</abbr>) is a functional body of the Greater London Authority and has been responsible for the oversight of the Metropolitan Police since January 2012. In 2017, a Combined Authority mayor with <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioner">PCC</abbr> functions was introduced in Greater Manchester, fulfilling the role of the <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioner">PCC</abbr> there. Similarly, in 2021, the responsibility of exercising the functions of the Police and Crime Commissioner in West Yorkshire transferred over to the West Yorkshire Combined Authority.</p>

<h4>Policing reform</h4>

<p>Before 2002, training of new police officers was the responsibility of the Home Office. Responsibility then passed to an independent police training body - Central Police Training and Development Authority (CENTREX). CENTREX and the information technology body Police Information Technology Organisation (<abbr title="Police Information Technology Organisation">PITO</abbr>), operating since 2002, were not funded through the police funding settlement. In 2007, CENTREX and <abbr title="Police Information Technology Organisation">PITO</abbr> were succeeded by the National Policing Improvement Agency (<abbr title="National Policing Improvement Agency">NPIA</abbr>), established as a Non-Departmental Public Body. <abbr title="National Policing Improvement Agency">NPIA</abbr> provided expertise for policing in areas such as information technology, information sharing, and recruitment. <abbr title="National Policing Improvement Agency">NPIA</abbr>’s funding was not consistently treated as part of the main police funding settlement.</p>

<p>In 2013, <abbr title="National Policing Improvement Agency">NPIA</abbr>’s functions were transferred to a number of bodies including the College of Policing and the Home Office. The College of Policing took over a number of police training and development roles; its Direct Entry programme for senior policing ranks has been funded through the police settlement since the financial year ending 2015. In the financial year ending 2014, the Police Innovation Fund was introduced and continued until the financial year ending March 2017, when the Police Transformation Fund (<abbr title="Police Transformation Fund">PTF</abbr>) was introduced. Both are funded from the main police settlement and both provide funding to develop capabilities. The police’s share of Airwave, the emergency services communication service, was funded separately by the Home Office between the financial years ending 2007 to 2016 (at times through <abbr title="National Policing Improvement Agency">NPIA</abbr>). Since the financial year ending March 2017, Airwave has been funded from within the police settlement, along with the Emergency Services Mobile Communication Programme and part funding of other police technology programmes that were previously funded from other budgets.</p>

<h4>Inspection and complaints</h4>

<p>A number of law enforcement arm’s length bodies receive part of their funding from other Home Office budgets and part from the police funding settlement. These arm’s length bodies include Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (<abbr title="Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services">HMICFRS</abbr>) which has a statutory duty to inspect the efficiency and effectiveness of the police forces in England and Wales, amongst other bodies. Since the financial year ending March 2015 <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services">HMICFRS</abbr> has received funding for its <abbr title="Police Effectiveness, Efficiency and Legitimacy">PEEL</abbr> (Police Effectiveness, Efficiency and Legitimacy) inspections from the police settlement. These arm’s length bodies also include the Independent Police Complaints Commission (<abbr title="Independent Police Complaints Commission">IPCC</abbr>) which was established in 2004 (succeeding the Police Complaints Authority) to oversee the police complaints system and to investigate serious incidents. Work and inspectors also transferred from Police Standard Units, local police force bodies responsible for dealing with police standards and complaints, to the <abbr title="Independent Police Complaints Commission">IPCC</abbr> over a period of time. The <abbr title="Independent Police Complaints Commission">IPCC</abbr> was fully funded from other Home Office budgets until the financial year ending March 2015; since then part of its funding has come from the police settlement. In 2018, the <abbr title="Independent Police Complaints Commission">IPCC</abbr> was reformed and renamed as the Independent Office for Police Conduct (<abbr title="Independent Office for Police Conduct">IOPC</abbr>).</p>

<h4>Core and specific grant funding</h4>

<p>The structure of Government funding to Police Authorities and subsequently Police and Crime Commissioners has changed significantly over time. Until the financial year ending March 2014, a significant part of core police funding was paid by the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG, now renamed Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities), based on their own relative needs-based formula. This funding transferred to the Home Office in the financial year ending March 2014. Historically grant funding has been made up of core grant funding, the Home Office element originally based on a funding formula, as well as a number of separate, targeted grant streams. Over the period these specific grant streams have ended and a number have been consolidated into core grant funding.</p>

<p>Rule 2 grant was introduced in the financial year ending March 2007 as a non-ring-fenced grant and was an amalgamation of five specific grants which were not distributed on the basis of the police funding formula: Rural Police Fund (funding for forces with large rural areas, from the financial year ending March 2002 until the financial year ending March 2007); Forensic DNA grant (started in April 2000 to expand the National DNA Database until all of the ‘known active offending population’ were covered); Integrated Police Learning and Development Programme; London and the south east allowances(supported the payment of London and SE allowances and free police travel in London); and the Special Priority Payment Scheme (started in 2002, providing funding for additional recruitment and retention payments to front line and operational police officers).</p>

<p>From the financial year ending March 2012, Rule 2 grant has been consolidated into core grant funding. Basic Command Unit (targeting high crime areas and funded by specific grant from the financial year ending March 2004 to the financial year ending March 2011) and Crime Fighting Fund (a specific grant paid from 2000-01 to the financial year ending March 2011 to encourage community activism and to support innovation by the voluntary sector to reduce substance misuse and offending by young people) grants were consolidated into core police grant at the same time.</p>

<p>A number of other specific grants have been consolidated into core police grant since the financial year ending March 2012, including Community Support Officers grant (Funding for Community Support Officers focusing on anti-social behaviour and low level crime) and the Neighbourhood Policing Fund (supported dedicated neighbourhood policing teams between 2005 and the financial year ending March 2013).</p>

<p>Royal Parks grant funding transferred into the police settlement in the financial year ending March 2016, becoming part of the National and International Capital City (<abbr title="National and International Capital City">NICC</abbr>) grant (<a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary">see glossary</a>). <abbr title="National and International Capital City">NICC</abbr> grant was first paid to the Metropolitan Police Service in the mid-1990s following changes to the police funding formula.  It was initially known as the Metropolitan Police Service special payment, but later renamed. It has sometimes been treated as part of core grant funding. <abbr title="National and International Capital City">NICC</abbr> grant was extended to the City of London police in the financial year ending March 2015.</p>

<h4>Police precept</h4>

<p>Police precept was introduced as part of the creation of Council Tax in the financial year ending March 1994, which replaced the community charge. It was then extended across England and Wales in the financial year ending March 1996.</p>

<p>A number of Government grants have been introduced in England since the financial year ending March 2011 which have a direct relationship with police precept levels, making it difficult to compare police precept levels over this period. Council Tax freeze grants started in the financial year ending March 2012, payable to local authorities in England including police authorities and <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>, who chose not to increase their Council Tax level for that year. There were a number of freeze grant schemes up until the financial year ending March 2016 and all apart from the financial year ending March 2013 scheme were consolidated into the police settlement, meaning that the <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr> who qualified for these former grants continue to receive this funding in the financial year ending March 2020. Local Council Tax support (<abbr title="Local Council Tax support">LCTS</abbr>) grant was introduced in the financial year ending March 2014 to compensate local authorities, including <abbr title="Police and Crime Commissioners">PCCs</abbr>, for a reduction in income due to changes in the Council Tax benefit system. These Government grants are paid from within the Home Office police settlement, apart from Council Tax freeze grants funding for the London police forces which are received through <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s local government finance settlement. Precept grant was introduced in the financial year ending March 2019 and is paid to the Common Council of the City of London on behalf of the City of London police to compensate the force for not receiving police precept income.</p>

<h4>Police pensions</h4>

<p>Prior to the financial year ending March 2007 police pensions were paid by police forces out of their general funding. Since the financial year ending March 2007, police force areas receive ring-fenced pensions top-up grant funding for police pensions from outside of the agreed police settlement funding total. This funding is paid according to demand as annual managed expenditure (<abbr title="Annual Managed Expenditure">AME</abbr>), taking into account a number of assumptions (including number of: retired officers and survivor benefits in payment; deceased officers no longer receiving a pension; and police officers and their force making contributions to the scheme). This financing arrangement protects police forces from fluctuations in the number of retirees and therefore in pension expenditure.</p>

<h4>Serious and organised crime national policing bodies</h4>

<p>Until 1998, serious and organised crime was dealt with through Regional Crime Squads, funded by contributions from police forces. These were replaced by the National Crime Squad (<abbr title="National Crime Squad">NCS</abbr>) which was initially funded by a levy on police forces, but from April 2002 was directly funded by the Home Office. In 2006, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (<abbr title="National Crime Squad">SOCA</abbr>) was formed from a merger of the National Crime Squad; the National Criminal Intelligence Service(an agency from 1992 which gathered intelligence and shared analysis and insight with police forces); the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (investigated serious and organised crime committed over the internet between 2001 and 2006); parts of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs; and the Immigration Service.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Crime Squad">SOCA</abbr> was an executive Non-Departmental Public Body (<abbr title="Non-Departmental Public Body">NDPB</abbr>) of the Home Office funded by grant, as well as receiving funding from other government sources including the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Crime Squad">SOCA</abbr> was replaced by the National Crime Agency in 2013. The National Crime Agency is a Non-Ministerial Government department and is funded outside of the police settlement; however, since the financial year ending March 2017 the National Crime Agency has received some funding from the police settlement to maintain its funding level in cash terms compared to the financial year ending March 2016. The National Crime Agency also absorbed the formerly separate Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (<abbr title="Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre">CEOP</abbr> formed in 2006 as an affiliated unit of <abbr title="National Crime Squad">SOCA</abbr> with operational independence).</p>

<h4>Counter-Terrorism Police Funding</h4>

<p>Prior to 2001, funding for police counter-terrorism activities was allocated to police forces in England and Wales through several mechanisms, including the general Police Grant; special grant payments; and ad hoc specific grants. From 2001, these separate funding streams were brought together and paid to police forces as ring-fenced counter-terrorism police funding. Total counter-terrorism police funding is announced to Parliament each year; however, force level allocations are not published for security reasons.</p>
