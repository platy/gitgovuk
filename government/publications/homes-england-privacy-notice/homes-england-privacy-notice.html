<p>Homes England (the trading name adopted by the Homes and Communities Agency) is committed to
protecting the privacy and security of your personal data.</p>

<p>This privacy notice aims to give you information on how Homes England collects and processes the
personal data provided to us, including information that you provide directly, and tell you about
your rights and how the law protects you.</p>

<p>Homes Englandâs websites are not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly collect
personal data that could identify individual children.</p>

<p>Please use the <a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary">glossary</a> to help you understand the meaning of some of the terms used in this
privacy notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Users of our website and web portals</h2>
<p>This section of our privacy notice applies to all individuals who visit our websites or provide information to us via one of our web portals.</p>

<p>It is important that you read this section of our privacy notice together with the main section of our privacy notice, or any other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you. This is so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Gov.uk and third party links</h3>
<p>Please note that our Gov.uk web address is provided to us by the Government Digital Service (GDS). Please ensure that when visiting this website that you read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/privacy-notice">GDS privacy notice</a> to understand how this may affect your personal data.</p>

<p>Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Information we collect</h3>
<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data, data such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identity data - includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth, nationality and gender</li>
  <li>Contact data - includes billing address, residential address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers</li>
  <li>Financial data - includes bank account and payment card details and information about the financial status of you or your business, including ownership structures and shareholdings etc.</li>
  <li>Transaction data - includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us</li>
  <li>Technical data - includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website</li>
  <li>Profile data - includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses</li>
  <li>Procurement data - includes information that we may need to obtain and consider to ascertain in connection with UK and EU public procurement legislation (eg whether grounds for exclusion under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 may apply)</li>
  <li>Usage data - includes information about how you use our website, products and services</li>
  <li>Marketing and Communications data - includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences</li>
</ul>

<p>We also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data is data that may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.</p>

<p>For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>

<p>We do not request any âspecial categoriesâ of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).</p>

<p>However, we recognise that where you are applying for a service or product, or tendering to provide goods, services or works, you may choose to provide us with information that falls within the definition of special categories of personal data.</p>

<p>For example, when you are using our Property Consents web portal to apply for our consent to make alternations to a property, you may decide to supply information about any mobility related issues faced by occupants in support of your application.</p>

<p>You are not required to provide any special category information as part of any application you make to us and your application will still be processed if you do not provide it.</p>

<p>Special categories of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection than other personal data. Where you do supply such information, we will rely on the ground that it is being processed by us in furtherance of the establishment and exercise of your legal rights.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>If you fail to provide personal data</h3>
<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested by us, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with products or services).</p>

<p>In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us, or decline your application, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>How is your personal data collected?</h3>
<p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct interactions. You may give us your Identity, Contact, Financial Data and Procurement Data by filling in
forms (eg Know your customer form) or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise. This includes personal data you provide or that you may have provided when you:

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>How we process your information</h3>
<p>We will only process your personal information if there is a lawful basis to do so. Most commonly,
we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or when processing is required prior to entering into a contract with you</li>
  <li>When processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us, for example, for one of our statutory functions</li>
  <li>When processing is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation</li>
  <li>To prevent and detect crime, including fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data.</p>

<p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

<p>Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where it is this is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>How we process âspecial categoriesâ of more sensitive personal information</h3>

We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. Our data protection policy contains details of the safeguards which we are required by law to maintain when processing such data.</p>

<p>We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where we need to carry out our legal obligations or exercise rights in connection with your engagement. For example:</li>

<ol>
  <li>Where it is needed in the public interest: for example, we will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equality and diversity monitoring and reporting.</li>
  <li>In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent. We do not need your consent to use special categories of your personal information in accordance with our written policy to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights in the field of employment law (insofar as applicable to agency workers and contractors).</li>
</ol>

<p>In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent.</p>

<p>You should be aware that it is not a condition of your engagement with us that you agree to any request for consent from us. Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone elseâs interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.</p>

<span class="number">4.5 </span>Retention</h3>

<p>Homes England will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

<p>Homes England has a records retention schedule that outlines how long we will retain information. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data collected as part of your engagement, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further
notice to you. Once you are no longer engaged by us we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with our records retention schedule.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information Governance (Freedom of Information, Data Subject Request, Complaints, General Enquiries)</h2>

<p>This section of our privacy notice will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you contact us to make a freedom of information request, or exercise your data subject rights under data protection legislation, make a complaint or submit a general enquiry.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Information we collect</h3>

<h4>Complaints</h4>

<p>When you contact us to make a complaint, we will use the information you have provided to investigate your complaint in accordance with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/homes-england/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> and to respond to you with the outcome.</p>

<h4>Freedom of Information Request</h4>

<p>When you contact us to make a freedom of information request, we will use the information provided to respond to you. It is our policy to publish our responses to freedom of information requests on our web site but we will not publish any information that identifies you as the requestor. We will also redact from the information that we provide in response to any freedom of information request all personal data that could identify any individual.</p>

<h4>Data Subject Request</h4>

<p>When you contact us to make a data subject request, we will ask you to provide evidence of your identity and copies of identity documentation, to ensure that we only provide your personal information to you and not to third parties.</p>

<p>We do not request any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>

<p>However, we recognise that you where you write to us with a complaint, you may choose to provide us with information that falls within the definition of Special Categories of Personal Data.</p>

<p>You are not required to provide this information and your complaint will still be processed if you do not provide it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>How we process your information</h3>

<p>We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use
your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us (for example, for one of our statutory functions)</li>
  <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation including the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 and data protection legislation</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Disclosures of your personal data</h3>

<p>We may share your personal data with third parties including third-party service providers and other Government departments and agencies. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services to Homes England. For example, our complaints, freedom of information requests and data subject requests are processed using a cloud-based system (Microsoft Dynamics 365)</li>
  <li>Professional advisers including lawyers and auditors</li>
  <li>Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government who are the sponsor body for Homes England and commissions Homes England to administer and deliver Government programmes</li>
  <li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, National Audit Office, regulators and other authorities who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances, including agencies involved in the prevention or detection of fraud and money laundering</li>
  <li>Third parties who are mentioned in your complaint, including your landlord (but only if your landlord is a local authority or registered provider). If your landlord is not a local authority or registered provider, then we will not contact your landlord without your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. You can find Microsoftâs contractual commitments in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&amp;DocumentTypeId=46" rel="external">Online Services Terms</a>. Microsoftâs terms commit Microsoft to the requirements on processors in GDPR Article 28 and other Articles of GDPR. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr#gdpr-faqs" rel="external">frequently asked questions about GDPR</a>.</p>

<p>We or the third parties may transfer your personal information outside the EU. If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information. Microsoft relies on the Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as the Model Clauses) as a basis for transfer of data. The Standard Contractual Clauses are standard terms provided by the European Commission that can be used to transfer data outside the European Economic Area in a compliant manner.</p>

<p>Microsoft has incorporated the Standard Contractual Clauses into all of its Volume Licensing agreements via the Online Services Terms. The Article 29 Working Party has found Microsoftâs implementation of the Standard Contractual Clauses is compliant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Retention</h3>

<p>We retain personal information related to complaints for a period of 3 years after the resolution of the complaint.</p>

<p>We retain information related to freedom of information requests and data subjects requests (including copies of identity documents provided in connection with a data subject request) for a period of 18 months after the response has been provided.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Disclosures of your personal data</h3>

<p>We may share your personal data with Third Parties for the purposes set out in the table above, including third-party service providers, regulatory bodies and other Government departments and agencies.</p>

<p>We require all Third Parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<p>We or our Third Parties may transfer your personal information outside the EU. If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span>Retention</h3>

<p>Homes England will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention schedule which you can request from us by contacting the Data Protection Officer. By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for a certain period after their relationship ceases for tax and VAT purposes.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see the Data Rights section for further information.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Buildings, sites and premises</h2>

<p>This section of our privacy notice applies to visitors to buildings, sites or other premises owned or
controlled by Homes England.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Information we collect and how it is processed</h3>

<p>We have security measures in place at our buildings and sites, including in some cases the use of CCTV and building access controls. This is to deter, prevent and detect crime at our premises and ensure only those people who are entitled to be admitted gain access to our premises.</p>

<p>Where CCTV is in use, there are signs in place to notify any individuals. The images captured are securely stored and only accessed on a need to know basis (e.g. to look into an incident).</p>

<p>We require visitors to our offices to sign in at reception and we keep a record of visitors for a short period of time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Retention</h3>

<p>CCTV recordings are typically automatically overwritten after a short period of time unless an issue is identified that requires investigation (such as a theft).</p>

<p>Our visitor records are securely stored and only accessible on a need to know basis (e.g. to look into an incident).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Our use of Credit Reference Agencies</h2>
<p>We carry out credit and identity checks when you apply for a product or services for you or your business. We may use Credit Reference Agencies (<abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr>) to help us with this. If you use our services, from time to time we may also search information that the <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> have, to help us manage those accounts.</p>

<p>To do this, weâll supply your personal data to <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> and theyâll give us information about you. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history. <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> will supply us with both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit information, financial situation, history and fraud prevention information.</p>

<p>Weâll use this data to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess whether you or your business is able to afford to make repayments</li>
  <li>verify the accuracy of the data youâve provided to us, including details of your identity</li>
  <li>help detect and prevent financial crime</li>
  <li>manage your accounts with us</li>
  <li>trace and recover debts</li>
  <li>ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will go on sharing your personal data with <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> for as long as you are a customer. This will also include details of funds going into the account, and the account balance. If you borrow, it will also include details of your repayments and whether you repay in full and on time. We will also tell the <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> when you settle your accounts with us. The <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> may give this information to other organisations that want to check your financial status.</p>

<p>When we ask <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> about you or your business, they will note it on your credit file. This is called a credit search footprint. Other lenders may see this and we may see credit searches from other lenders.</p>

<p>If you apply for a one of our products or services (such as where you apply for a Help to Buy Equity Loan), weâll get details of your credit history from a CRA (and share information about you with the CRA) and use this information to work out whether you or your business can afford to borrow or pay back.</p>

<p>We may also carry out further credit checks on you while youâre a customer to maintain an accurate and up-to-date record of your credit history.</p>

<p>If youâre making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse, partner or civil partner â or that you are in business with other partners or directors, weâll link your records together. You should discuss this with them, and share this information with them before submitting the application.</p>

<p><abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> to break that link.</p>

<p>The identities of the <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr>, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> are explained in more detail on their websites.</p>

<p>Theyâve created a joint document called the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) which is accessible from each of the three <abbr title="Credit reference agencies">CRAs</abbr> â going to any of these three links will also take you to the same CRAIN document:</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Our use of Fraud Prevention Agencies</h2>

<p>If we, or a FPA, determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have requested, or to employ you, or we may stop providing existing services to you.</p>

<p>A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the <abbr title="Fraud Prevention Agencies">FPAs</abbr>, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you.</p>
