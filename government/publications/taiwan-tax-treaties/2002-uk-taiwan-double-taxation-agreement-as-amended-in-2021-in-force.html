<p>8. The fact that a company which is a resident of a territory controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other territory, or which carries on business in that other territory (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, where an enterprise of a territory carries on business in the other territory through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each territory be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.<br><br></p>

  <li>
    <p>In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the territory in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.<br><br></p>

<p>and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p>

<p>2. Where a territory includes in the profits of an enterprise of that territory – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other territory has been charged to tax in that other territory and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned territory if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other territory shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits.

  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) except as provided in sub-paragraph (b), the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends;<br><br>
b) where dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 by an investment vehicle which distributes most of this income annually and whose income from such immovable property is exempted from tax, the tax charged by the territory of which the company paying the dividends is a resident shall not exceed 15 per cent. of the gross amount of the dividends other than where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a pension scheme established in the other territory, where the exemption provided in sub-paragraph (a) shall apply.</p>

<p>This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. The competent authorities of the territories shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.</p>

<p>3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the territory of which the company making the distribution is a resident and also includes any other item which, under the laws of the territory of which the company paying the dividend is a resident, is treated as a dividend or distribution of a company.<br></p>

<p>4. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 of this Agreement, as the case may be, shall apply.<br></p>

<p>5. Where a company which is a resident of a territory derives profits or income from the other territory, that other territory may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other territory or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other territory, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other territory.</p>

<h2>Article 11 — interest</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Interest arising in a territory and paid to a resident of the other territory may be taxed in that other territory. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, such interest may also be taxed in the territory in which it arises and according to the laws of that territory, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other territory, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the gross amount of the interest. The competent authorities of the territories shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.  <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. The term “interest” shall not include any item which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 of this Agreement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (7) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a territory, carries on business in the other territory in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other territory independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 of this Agreement, as the case may be, shall apply. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount of interest. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each territory, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interest shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is an authority of that territory or a subdivision or local authority of that territory or a person who is a resident of that territory for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, interest arising in a territory shall be exempt from tax in that territory if:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) it is paid to and beneficially owned by the other territory or a local authority thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of that other territory or local authority thereof; or<br><br>
b) it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or any other debt-claim or credit guaranteed or insured by an approved agency or instrumentality of that other territory.</p>

<p>8. For the purposes of paragraph (7)(b) of this Article the term “approved agency or instrumentality” means:</p>

<p>a) in the case of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement, the Export Credits Guarantee Department and such other agencies and instrumentalities of that territory as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities;<br><br>
b) in the case of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(b) of Article 2 of this Agreement, such agencies and instrumentalities of that territory as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities.</p>

<h2>Article 12 — royalties</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Royalties arising in a territory and paid to a resident of the other territory may be taxed in that other territory.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, those royalties may also be taxed in the territory in which they arise, and according to the law of that territory, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other territory, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the gross amount of the royalties. The competent authorities of the territories shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work (including cinematograph films, and films or tapes for radio or television broadcasting), any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information (know-how) concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.<br><br></p>

In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 of this Agreement, as the case may be, shall apply.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a territory when the payer is an authority of that territory or a subdivision or local authority of that territory or a person who is a resident of that territory for the purposes of its tax. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a territory or not, has in a territory a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the territory in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

    <p>Where, by reason of a special relationship between the person referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article and some other person, or between both of them and some third person, the amount of the income referred to in that paragraph exceeds the amount (if any) which would have been agreed upon between them in the absence of such a relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the income shall remain taxable according to the laws of each territory, due regard being had to the other applicable provisions of this Agreement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 22 — elimination of double taxation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Subject to the provisions of the law of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement regarding the allowance as a credit against its tax of tax payable in another territory (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):</li>
</ol>

<p>a) Tax payable under the laws of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(b) of Article 2 of this Agreement and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within that territory (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any tax payable under the laws of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the first mentioned tax is computed;<br><br>
b) in the case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(b) of Article 2 of this Agreement to a company which is a resident of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent. of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any tax payable under the laws of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(b) of Article 2 of this Agreement for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph) the tax payable under the laws of that territory by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.</p>

<p>2. In the case of the territory referred to in paragraph (3)(b) of Article 2 of this Agreement, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:</p>

<p>Tax payable under the laws of the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (a) of Article 2 of this Agreement and in accordance with this Agreement (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against the tax payable under the laws of the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (b) of Article 2 of this Agreement. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the tax referred to in paragraph (3) (b) of Article 2 of this Agreement on that income computed in accordance with its tax laws.<br></p>

<p>3. For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this Article, profits, income and capital gains owned by a resident of a territory which may be taxed in the other territory in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other territory.</p>

<h2>Article 23 — limitation of relief</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where under any provision of this Agreement any income or gains are relieved from tax in a territory and, under the law in force in the other territory an individual, in respect of that income or those gains, is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other territory and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under this Agreement in the first-mentioned territory shall apply only to so much of the income or gains as is taxed in the other territory. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where, under any provision of this Agreement,  a partnership is entitled, as a resident of the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (b) of Article 2 of this Agreement, to relief from tax in the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (a) of Article 2 of this Agreement on any income or capital gains, that provision shall not be construed as restricting the right of the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (a) of Article 2 of this Agreement to tax any member of the partnership who is a resident of the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (a) of Article 2 of this Agreement on his share of such income or capital gains; but any such income or gains shall be treated for the purposes of Article 22 of this Agreement as income or gains from sources in the territory referred to in paragraph (3) (b) of Article 2 of this Agreement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 24 — non-discrimination</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Citizens or nationals of a territory shall not be subjected in the other territory to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which citizens or nationals of that other territory in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the law in one of the territories shall not be subjected in the other territory to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which a legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the law in force in that other territory in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, is or may be subjected. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a territory has in the other territory shall not be less favourably levied in that other territory than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other territory carrying on the same activities.  <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Except where the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 9, paragraph (5) of Article 11, paragraph (6) of Article 12, paragraph (4) of Article 21, or Article 27 of this Agreement apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a territory to a resident of the other territory shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned territory.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enterprises of a territory, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other territory, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned territory to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned territory are or may be subjected.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either territory to grant to individuals not resident in that territory any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Article shall apply to the taxes which are the subject of this Agreement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 25 — mutual agreement procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the territories result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those territories, present his case to the competent authority of either territory. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other territory, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the territories.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the territories shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the territories may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 26 — exchange of information</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The competent authorities of the territories shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the territories, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any information received under paragraph (1) by a territory shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that territory and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes referred to in paragraph (1), or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a territory may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both territories and the competent authority of the supplying territory authorises such use.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) be construed so as to impose on a territory the obligation:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other territory;<br><br>
(b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other territory;<br><br>
(c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.</p>

<p>4. If information is requested by a territory in accordance with this Article, the other territory shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other territory may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph (3) but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a territory to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.<br></p>

<p>5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph (3) be construed to permit a territory to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.</p>

<h2>Article 27 — entitlement to benefits</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a benefit under this Agreement shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or a capital gain if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Agreement.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a benefit under this Agreement is denied to a person under paragraph 1, the competent authority of the territory that would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or a capital gain, if such competent authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or arrangement referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authority of the territory to which the request has been made will consult with the competent authority of the other territory before rejecting a request made under this paragraph by a resident of that other territory.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Article 28 — entry into force</h2>
