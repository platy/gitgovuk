<p>Recognising the strong and mutually supportive relationship between trade, regulation and innovation, and the contribution of each to economic growth and addressing shared challenges and affirming the Participants’ commitment to expanding their cooperation in this area.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Participants, in the spirit of promoting closer relationships, intend to further support and work cooperatively within the boundaries of existing laws and treaties in their respective jurisdictions on goals and issues as set forth below.</p>

<h2>SECTION 1: OBJECTIVES</h2>

<p>Objectives of this <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</abbr> include:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Enhancing cooperation</h3>

<p>a. The Participants share the objective of deepening their already well-established economic development cooperation and trade relations to strengthen their businesses and create jobs in both Indiana and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>b. The Participants share the objective of developing a structured framework of engagement to identify and promote opportunities for their respective citizens and businesses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Accelerating the development of initiatives to advance low emissions technology</h3>

<p>a. Particularly in relation to technologies needed to address climate change, in relation to electric vehicles, agriculture and manufacturing, and through collaboration and the sharing of best practices.</p>

<p>b. Where appropriate, the Participants commit to considering and pursuing solutions to specific market access barriers, such as government procurement, and supporting regulators and professional bodies interested in pursuing recognition arrangements on professional qualifications.</p>

<p>c. The Participants commit to promoting representative and accessible trade missions with a focus on diversity and inclusion, which look to enhance the profile and networks of minority-owned businesses with focused delegations, joint roundtables and other diverse, targeted events.</p>

<p>d. The Participants will look at deepening commercial interactions, including mutual exchange of business delegations, appropriate sharing of market information as well as other cooperative activities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Growing academic and research ties</h3>

<p>a. The Participants will work to promoting collaborative projects, research, information exchange and the sharing of best practice and expertise regarding innovation, with a particular focus on priority sectors whilst simultaneously ensuring that any collaboration should conform to proportionate standards of research security and integrity.</p>

<h2>SECTION 2: AREAS OF COOPERATION</h2>

<p>In line with the principle of mutual benefit, the Participants share the intent to cooperate with respect to the areas below. These areas of cooperation may feature more specifically in the sectoral areas of cooperation outlined in Sections 2 and 3 below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Economic development and investment</h3>

<p>This area of cooperation promotes business interactions between the Participants, including mutual exchange of appropriate business delegations and market information as well as other cooperative activities in recognition of the importance of two-way investment. This should enhance the mutual trading relationship in key areas such as advanced manufacturing, aerospace and aviation, and green economy and energy transition. The Participants will work to address changing technology and disruptive innovations, with cutting-edge provisions that maximise opportunities for Indiana and the United Kingdom, and in all interactions aim to uphold values of inclusive trade and inclusive growth.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Workforce development</h3>

<p>This area of cooperation supports the sharing of best practices and policy developments to deliver accessible workforce training and opportunities. The Participants will share best practices to ensure their respective workforces can meet the needs of high-demand, high-wage and high-quality jobs created by innovation across all sectors. Acknowledging the shift toward a low carbon economy, the Participants will seek to create a dialogue on how to best train and transition their respective workforces to adapt to new technologies and continue to sustain communities. They will exchange expertise on ‘just transitions’ for workers as the shift towards low carbon economies brings about changes to the types of job that exist and will work together to ensure that the policy is people-focused and considers the impact on jobs and communities.</p>

<p>The Participants will commit to widely accessible green skills education exchanges for people of all backgrounds. The Participants commit to identifying opportunities for strategic partnerships between private sector companies to strengthen capabilities to compete in international markets; this could include worker exchange programmes or embedding team members to exchange knowledge, skills, and best practices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Innovation and regulatory cooperation</h3>

<p>Within the framework of each Participant’s existing laws and regulations, this area of cooperation supports and enables innovation, where appropriate, by sharing expertise and best practices that recognise the importance of resilient and forward-looking regulatory frameworks, allowing for experimentation and adoption of innovative and disruptive technologies (e.g., automated vehicles, artificial intelligence and blockchain). This will further signal mutual ambition to support innovation-sensitive sectors, build like-mindedness on the importance of trade resilience to innovation, whilst being mindful of any consumer protection, confidentiality, safety and privacy concerns that may arise.</p>

<p>Where appropriate, cooperation in this area intends to reduce existing and anticipated barriers to trade for innovative companies, help them grow their expertise in transformative areas and facilitates business in the other Participant’s market.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Academic cooperation</h3>

<p>This area of cooperation focuses on facilitating the creation of new exchange programs or the enhancement of existing programs to support and encourage appropriate institutional collaboration between colleges and universities, as well as research institutions in Indiana and the United Kingdom. Any such collaboration should conform to proportionate standards of research security and integrity.</p>
