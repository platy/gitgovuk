<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First Steps</h2>

<p>In the event that you experience an incident of rape or sexual assault, it is your choice about what you do next. This information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact the emergency number 911 to request police support</li>
  <li>Contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>Contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-belmopan">British High Commission, Belmopan</a> 24/7 on telephone +501 822 2147</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How the Embassy can support you</h2>

<p>We take any report of rape and sexual assault seriously. We will be empathetic, patient, sensitive and non-judgmental and can</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide you with immediate support on the telephone at any time of the day or night</li>
  <li>help you make arrangements to contact your family/and or friends, travel back to the UK, contact your insurance company, and/or provide you with information on support in the UK</li>
  <li>tell you about local police and legal procedures and provide information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belize-list-of-medical-facilities">medical facilities</a> and a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belize-list-of-lawyers/belize-lawyers">local lawyers</a>. However, only you can decide whether to report the incident to the police or take legal action – we cannot make this decision for you. Whatever you choose, we will support your wishes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in Belize</h2>

<p>Filing a report with the police is your choice. The investigation and prosecution of a crime that occurs in Belize is the responsibility of local authorities alone, therefore you must report the crime while you are in Belize and in the town or village where the incident occurred.</p>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. You may want to ask a friend or relative to go to the police station with you – many people find it helps not to be alone.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can ask them to inform the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-belmopan">British High Commission, Belmopan</a> 24/7 on telephone +501 822 2147.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after the incident to prevent the loss or contamination of forensic evidence. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police, storing them in a bag for better retention of evidence. You may wish to preserve evidence by keeping items such as condoms, toothbrushes, a glass (if a drink was potentially spiked) or any forms of communication you may have had with your attacker, such as text messages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can request to speak to a female police officer, but may have to speak to a male one if no female officer is available.</li>
  <li>It is your right to be questioned in a private room</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you may have been drugged</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be asked about the description of the assailant or their identity, if known, where and when the incident happened, what happened, the circumstances, and if there were any witnesses.</p>

<p>Insist on getting a copy of the police report, the case number and the details of the Prosecution Office that will deal with the report. This will allow you to follow up on the case later on.</p>

<p>Although a public prosecutor is responsible for prosecuting the case, you may want to consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belize-list-of-lawyers/belize-lawyers">hiring a local lawyer</a> to secure appropriate legal guidance. A lawyer can represent your interests with the police and the court.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Belize</h2>

<p>The British High Commission will still be able to assist you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company and your family, travel back to the UK and providing you with information on support organisations in the UK.</p>

<p>The British High Commission can provide you with lists of English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belize-list-of-medical-facilities">medical facilities</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belize-list-of-lawyers/belize-lawyers">lawyers</a> and translators.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can also report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. member of consular staff may be able to accompany you if you want them to, depending on location and timing.</p>

<p>You do not have to report what happened to the police if you do not want to. If you are unsure, you may need time to consider. However, if you do not report it, your case will not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence and translators.</p>

<p>Even if you decide not to report what has happened to the police, we would strongly suggest you seek medical attention. A doctor can determine if your injuries need treatment and can give you advice about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after rape or sexual assault abroad</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Reporting the crime in Belize – what happens next?</h2>

<p>To report a sexual violence or assault incident, you should go to the local police station and file a police report in person. You can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=147g5OZZn9dRLx2OcuCXHNTuy7LM&amp;ll=17.197965119715523%2C-88.58100249999998&amp;z=8" rel="external">list of all police stations in Belize on the police website here</a>. If you are 18 years old or over, the local authorities will only be able to investigate the rape or sexual assault if the report comes from you directly. In the case of minors, anyone with concerns about a child being at risk or being a victim of abuse is entitled to report it to the authorities.</p>

<p>All major police stations have officers who are specially trained to deal sensitively with victims of sexual crimes. The police will interview you and ask you to make a statement about the incident. They will keep any clothes, which may be evidence of the attack, to present to a forensic examiner.</p>

<p>You should review your statement carefully, before signing, to confirm it accurately reflects your testimony as it will be sealed and treated as an exhibit for the court trial.  Ensure that you receive a copy.
The police will provide you with a referral for a free forensic medical examination and will accompany you to the hospital. If you prefer, you can have a friend, family member or consular staff accompany you for emotional support.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>The medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<p>The purpose of the medical examination is to check your health, recommend a course of treatment and collect evidence should you decide to file a complaint.</p>

<p>All local public and private hospitals treat victims of rape and sexual assault. Generally, hospitals require a referral letter from the police to carry out a forensic medical examination. A referral is not needed for medical treatment and it is your right to choose to have treatment and forego a forensic examination. If you go to a hospital with physical injuries that could be as a result of a criminal action, doctors in Belize are legally required to report this to the police.</p>

<p>The doctor will carry out a physical examination and take photographs and/or samples for evidence. The doctor will</p>

<ul>
  <li>prioritise your case as an emergency</li>
  <li>collect and document forensic evidence</li>
  <li>offer information, treatment, and referrals for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, including administering Post Exposure Prophylaxis</li>
  <li>where appropriate, assess pregnancy risk and offer Emergency Contraceptives (ECs)</li>
  <li>address any of your medical concerns</li>
  <li>discuss treatment options, including reproductive health services</li>
  <li>testify in court, if necessary</li>
  <li>ensure that you are offered crisis intervention, support, and advocacy during and after the exam process</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Treatment</h2>

<p>If you do not wish to report the crime, you can still choose to have medical treatment, although forensic evidence will not be collected. You should visit the nearest hospital, local gynaecologist/urologist or GP. Here is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/belize-list-of-medical-facilities">list of medical facilities</a>.</p>

<p>Hospital tests and treatment at government hospitals will be free of cost, and a copy of all documentation should be provided to you. You or your insurance company will have to pay for treatment at a private hospital.</p>

<p>It is possible that you will have been exposed to the HIV virus. You should request the “Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)”- a treatment that may stop HIV replicating in the body and so prevent the virus from attacking the immune system. More information on risks is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/HIV" rel="external">NHS website</a>. HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on your return to the UK.</p>

<p>If you are female, you can prevent an unwanted pregnancy with oral emergency contraception, available at any pharmacy. Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication so when you return home, you can let your local health provider know.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Police investigations in Belize - what to expect?</h2>

<p>You can expect the police to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open a criminal case and give the case a number</li>
  <li>interview you and take a statement from you</li>
  <li>conduct an investigation and collect evidence and witness statements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigations can often last months, and sometimes can go unresolved depending on the complexity of the case and if there are difficulties gathering evidence and statements, but you are free to leave the country during this process.</p>

<p>If the offender is unknown, there will be a process to identify them by putting together a composite sketch for identification. If needed, an identification line-up will be conducted and/or a search of the area to locate the suspect.</p>

<p>If during the investigation you decide that you no longer wish to continue with the complaint, you must inform the Department of Public Prosecution. You will be required to give a statement setting out clearly the reasons for withdrawal.</p>

<p>Once the police have sufficient evidence, the accused is charged and placed in custody until appearing before a magistrate where they can make a plea of “guilty” or “not guilty”.  At this point bail will be granted or refused. If you believe the offender may harm you if released, let the investigator know as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<p>The investigative officer will pass the case to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) who is responsible for presenting the case before a judge. The DPP will review the case and decide if there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.</p>

<p>Under Belize law, rape is a serious criminal offence. The minimum sentence that a convicted person can receive for the offence of rape is imprisonment for eight years and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life.</p>

<p>If the accused is ordered to a trial, you will most likely be asked to provide testimony in court as a central witness. In the majority of cases, you would only need to give such testimony once. However, if you do not testify, the chances of winning the case may be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The court will not automatically update the British High Commission on the progress of your case, but we can make enquiries and seek updates on your behalf. Consular staff will not be able to attend court hearings with you and you may wish to be accompanied by a friend or family member.</p>

<p>If you have already left the country, this would not stop the court proceedings, but you may be asked to return specifically for the trial. You can choose to appoint a lawyer to act on your behalf while you are out of Belize.</p>

<p>The length of the judicial process will depend on whether the assailant pleads “guilty” or “not guilty,” the availability of both parties and the number of adjournments.</p>

<p>At the end of the court case, you will be given a verdict made up of a ruling (innocent or guilty) and a sentence (determining the punishment). Both sides, the plaintiff and the defence, may appeal the ruling or the punishment.</p>

<p>Your lawyer can guide you on compensatory claims. There is no state-funded compensation scheme in Belize to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered because of a violent crime.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your UK health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in Belize.</p>
</div>

<p>If you did not have a medical examination whilst abroad, you may wish to have one when you return to the UK. Even if you did not sustain physical injuries following a sexual assault, you may find it helpful to seek medical advice. You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre know what has happened to you so that you can receive further support and advice.</p>

<p>The UK police will not have been informed of the incident by the Belize police.</p>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">advice on returning to the UK following rape and sexual assault abroad</a></p>
