<span class="number">1. </span>Director’s message</h2>

<p>Last month I attended CyberUK, the UK government’s flagship cyber security event, in Newport. It was great to see so much of the industry represented and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to reconnect with colleagues and partners, as well as being able to speak with the people behind some truly innovative businesses and ideas. The best part of the event was hosting the Cyber Den, which provided companies that had taken part in our growth and innovation programmes the chance to showcase their ideas in front of a panel of judges. I would like to once again congratulate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=de259f4d8b&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Exalens</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=0692560ec1&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Capslock</a>, whose strong pitches meant they were crowned the joint winners this year.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, we have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=2d70550143&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Infosecurity Europe</a> taking place on 21 to 23 June at the ExCeL in London. Infosecurity Europe is the biggest gathering of the information security community in Europe and is another great opportunity to share innovation, learn from each other, build relationships and support growth of the cyber security ecosystem. Once again, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is running the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=073a3c0c09&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">UK’s Most Innovative Cyber SME 2022</a> competition, in partnership with Infosecurity Europe and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=61e3705d1e&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">techUK</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=04eb0e32c1&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill</a> continues its progression through Parliament having successfully passed its third reading in the Commons.

<span class="number">5. </span>Call for views on tougher consumer protections against malicious apps closing this month</h2>

<p>Following a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=ad632de2db&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">report</a> published by the National Cyber Security Centre which revealed people’s data and money are at risk due to both fraudulent and badly designed apps that can be exploited by hackers, DCMS launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=da58e9bbe5&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">call for views</a> to ask the tech industry about enhanced security and privacy requirements for firms running app stores and developers making apps.</p>

<p>Under new proposals, app stores for smartphones, game consoles, TVs and other smart devices could be asked to commit to a new voluntary code of practice setting out baseline security and privacy requirements. This would be the first such measure in the world. The consultation closes on Wednesday 29 June.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Survey: cyber security as a Profession</h2>

<p>The Global Forum on Cyber Expertise <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=d71621daa5&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">is gathering international views via a survey on developing cyber security as a profession</a>. The survey includes questions on whether pathways for cyber professionals are clear; whether better recognised qualifications are needed to strengthen the profession and whether there should be a license to practice.</p>

<p>Based in the Netherlands, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise’s mission is to&nbsp;strengthen international cooperation on cyber capacity building by connecting needs, resources and expertise and by making practical knowledge available to the global community.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>“Upskill in Cyber” launches</h2>

<p>Cybersecurity trainers SANS, in partnership with the Government, are launching&nbsp;Upskill in Cyber, a new free programme that&nbsp;aims to identify and rapidly reskill individuals for roles in cyber security in just ten weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Launching on 4 July, students will&nbsp; undertake two SANS training courses and&nbsp;receive soft skills development to ensure they are immediately deployable within the cyber security workforce. Successful graduates will complete the programme with two GIAC certifications – GFACT and GSEC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>‍SANS are currently looking for individuals who are seeking to start a career in cyber security, whether they are currently employed in non-cyber roles or unemployed.</p>

<p>Applications for Upskill in Cyber close on Monday 27 June 2022. You can find further information on the programme and submit an application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=1b232a781e&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Cyber Explorers Birmingham event</h2>

<p>Last month, a DCMS-funded campaign to promote Cyber Explorers, a free, digital platform to teach 11-14 year olds cyber security skills, culminated in a Cyber Explorers Careers Fair in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Delivered by Niyo Enterprise, the event was attended by over 300 students from three secondary schools, and raised awareness of cyber as a potential career option and the opportunities in the sector. The young people heard speeches from Simon Hepburn, CEO at UK Cyber Security Council, as well as from a panel with representatives from Niyo Enterprise, Black Codher Bootcamp and cyber crime interns from West Midlands Cyber Crime Unit. The pupils also participated in Cyber Hunt games led by organisations such as QA, Taran3D, Metcloud, Girls Who Code and Aston University.</p>

<p>Niyo Enterprise said: “We can’t overstate the impact technology will continue to have on society and are proud to be doing our part to raise awareness amongst the next generation of developers, cyber security experts, and engineers. We believe that inspiring and educating girls from a young age is very important in raising aspirations for them to take on apprenticeships and even bootcamps in the future to become future tech stars.”</p>
