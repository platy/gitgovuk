<p>Created July 2018</p>

<p>Last Reviewed July 2021</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>1 . The data which the CMA creates, receives, or maintains including data inherited from its predecessor organisations (the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission) is subject to the requirements of this Data Retention Policy.</p>

<h2>Retention policy</h2>

<p>2 . CMA data should only be kept for as long as there is an administrative need to keep it to carry out its business or support functions, or for as long as it is required to demonstrate compliance for audit purposes or for legislative requirements. Legislative requirements include, but are not limited to, compliance with the Public Record Acts (selection and disposition of records), the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, the Competition Law Act 199, the Lord Chancellor’s Code of Practice on Records Management contained in the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR.</p>

<h2>Data retention periods</h2>

<p>3 . To comply with the administrative and legislative requirements described above, a retention period for the data based on one of the options listed below needs to be agreed with the Information Access Team (IAT) and the Senior Departmental Records Officer (DRO). For paper files, the retention period will generally be set at the level of the file series (for example the retention period applicable to a particular case) rather than for individual files and for SharePoint Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) the retention period will be set at the Site or Project level, although exceptionally this can be set at the library level. The records management team will periodically review archived paper files in accordance with the Public Records Act 1956 (PRA) to ensure they are not being retained when there is no business need to do so, and establish what records are for permanent preservation at The National Archives (TNA). For SharePoint, administrators in IT will apply the agreed retention period and this will then be carried out automatically at the due time. The retention period options are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Destroy at 2 years after the last document was added to the case (EDRM) or from the date of file closure – Examples of documents that fall into this category are: policies, guidance and manuals that have been updated and are no longer applicable to at the time or have been superseded and not relate to a particular case. General administration documents that are of no value past the date of creation for that particular purpose such as meeting invitations and draft documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Destroy at 6 years after the last document was added to the case (EDRM) or from the date of file closure – Financial records that are older than 6 years, compliance communications, phase 1 mergers, information gathering, internal staff management, correspondence with The National Archives and legal advice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Destroy 8 years after the last document was added to the case (EDRM) or from the date of file closure – Ephemeral information which becomes out of date or no longer has an administrative need should be destroyed after 8 years after the last modified date for example most of the data held by various CMA teams such as commercial, HR and corporate services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Destroy 10 years after the last document was added to the case (EDRM) or from the date of file closure - records relating to enforcement, records management, FOI’s, board papers, markets and mergers and Office of the Chief Economist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Destroy 15 years after the last document was added to the case (EDRM) or from the date of file closure – Most information held by the CMA will not be required to be kept for longer than 15 years. As information ages, it has less value especially as staff leave the CMA, markets change, and information becomes out-of-date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Destroy at 20 years after the last document was added to the case (EDRM) or from the date of file closure – This is the maximum period to retain information unless required by The National Archives under an Operational Selection Policy (See Permanent Preservation below) or data that can be considered to be an Exception (See below). There are costs involved in storing information for this amount of time and there needs to be good justification that it needs to be kept for 20 years. It should be noted that any information whether electronic or paper that needs to be kept for longer than 20 years needs to be approved by the Lord Chancellor’s Office on an annual basis. Submissions are made through The National Archives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Permanent Preservation – In accordance with TNAs Operational Selection Policy 43 which relates to Competition Casework (currently under review) the CMA is required to select for permanent preservation and eventual transfer to TNA (Subject to the Restrictions on Disclosure contained in the Enterprise Act 2002) significant Competition Casework such as Competition Act Investigations, Super Complaints, Phase 2 Markets or Mergers Inquiries and the related Phase 1 inquiries, court cases, and cases where undertakings have been given.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Review periods</h2>

<p>4 . Although the CMA has stipulated retention periods detailed above, we also have implemented a review period into our records. This ensures that we regularly review our records to determine if we should keep these records for longer or shorter periods of time. This enables teams across the CMA to assess the ongoing business need to keep closed records. At the time of completion of cases it is not always apparent if they are going to be significant historically for transfer to TNA or if this case will lead to further investigations or market studies that will benefit from data collated for the case in question. The review period will provide the CMA with a mechanism for maintaining and reviewing corporate records in real time, whilst also ensuring deletion of records are maintained throughout the various review retention periods.</p>

<h2>Extended data retention</h2>

<p>5 . Inevitably there will be a few exceptions where the retention requirement does not fall into the above timescales. In these circumstances, IT can apply a unique disposition date to the SharePoint Site or Library. These exceptions are often found in the support areas of the Office such as HR where, for example, staff files such as pension records need to be kept for 100 years from a person’s date of birth. Other exceptions are required for ongoing business use such as consultation data and review of CMA work post closure of cases. Below provides more detail on these 2 unique exceptions for the CMA.</p>

<h2>Review of CMA work for research and evaluation</h2>

<p>6 . If the CMA deems the cases to be of significant interest it may engage a third-party contractor to analyse the casa data, therefore retaining personal data for this purpose. This will assist the department in assessing how we conduct our work, namely identifying any issues in the decisions taken during the lifespan of those cases selected for research and evaluation. Under Article 6(1)(e) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation to lawfully process personal data, the CMA can use personal data contained in the casefile for necessary performance evaluations that are in the interest of the public. The CMA will determine which cases are necessary on a regular basis by establishing and targeting a varied but limited number of cases for the purpose. This review and evaluation will be conducted independently of the CMA, to ensure the CMA can take stock of their decisions, test their working procedures, and take stock of any mistakes encountered throughout the case history. As part of the case selection consideration will be given to transfer to TNA, and the final selected case for research and evaluation will be transferred to TNA at the 20-year timeframe stipulated in the Public Records Act 1956.</p>

<h2>Retention of personal data</h2>

<p>7 . Any personal data processed by the CMA, for example as part of a project or case, or for managing staff should only be kept for as long as there is a business need, otherwise it should be destroyed at the earliest opportunity. The CMA will make a proportionality assessment on a case-by-case basis, namely personal information that is interwoven throughout the record will remain part of the casework file to ensure the records are complete and an accurate account of the work conducted throughout the case. Personal data collated as a consultation, will be disposed of and only the responses kept for reference.</p>

<p>Data protection law requires that ‘Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed’.</p>

<p>‘Personal data’ is any information relating to a living individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly from it, in particular by reference to a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.</p>

<p>‘Processing’ is anything we do to personal data for example collecting, receiving, storing, viewing, accessing, disclosing, sharing, profiling, deleting, redacting.</p>

<p>Examples of where personal data might be being processed and what needs to be done with the personal data to ensure compliance with data protection law are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At the end of a project or case it is the Project Director’s responsibility to decide whether there is a continuing need to keep the personal data that has been collected, including that contained in Public Folders, or whether it can be securely deleted. Consideration should be given to redacting or anonymising the personal data if it is deemed reasonable. Proportionality is considered at this stage as personal data will form part of the corporate record, and information is interwoven across the casework file. Where it is decided that the personal data should be securely deleted, the relevant SharePoint Site administrator for that project should carry this out. In the case of hardcopy or physical material a nominated person from the project team should do this but in either scenario the Records Management Team and IAT should be kept informed of the decisions that have been made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outlook accounts - Emails containing personal data that is no longer required should be deleted as soon as possible. Outlook accounts will be deleted when a member of staff leaves the CMA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OneDrive – Documents containing personal data that is no longer required should be deleted as soon as possible. OneDrive accounts will be deleted when a member of staff leaves the CMA.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
