<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction to the pre-opening phase</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Free schools: the pre-opening phase</h3>

<p>Opening a free school is challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. This guidance is designed to support you through this phase, as you turn your plans for a school into reality. It sets out the legal requirements and tasks <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">(see Annex A)</a> you will need to undertake to ensure your school opens successfully.</p>

<p>Through the free schools programme, the Department for Education (DfE) has created thousands of new school places, opening schools across the country. As of May 2021, there are 560 open free schools, 48 university technical colleges and 22 studio schools, which will provide over 340,000 places when at capacity.</p>

<p>The government is more committed than ever to its mission to level up opportunity and transform the lives and prospects of a generation. Every child in this country, whatever their background, should have the opportunity to get a world-class education, giving them knowledge and skills that set them up for life. DfE’s expectation, therefore, is that your plans for your school will be focused on delivering a high standard of education for all pupils.
The final decision to open any free school depends on the Secretary of State entering into a legal contract, the funding agreement, with the academy trust. The Secretary of State will sign a funding agreement only if they are satisfied that there is a suitable site for the school that provides good value for money and that the school will provide a good standard of education, with a viable and sustainable number of pupils from its first day of operation. DfE will advise, challenge and support you throughout the pre-opening phase to ensure that your school meets these requirements.</p>

<p>For some projects, progressing to the pre-opening phase is subject to precise and strict conditions, which are set out in your approval letter. Further conditions may also be set during the pre-opening phase. These conditions often relate to a specific risk that must be addressed for the project to proceed successfully. Failure to meet any of these conditions would make it unlikely that the Secretary of State would be willing to enter into a funding agreement with your trust.</p>

<p>Equally, if you run an existing school, or have another application in pre-opening and a DfE official or external expert (EE) raises concerns about it or it is subject to a financial notice to improve from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), DfE may need to reconsider the approval of this project, as a result of which it could be deferred or cancelled. The same would apply if Ofsted judge a school you currently run as either requires improvement or inadequate, or if there is a significant decline in the performance of one or more of your existing schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Free school stages</h3>

<p>These stages set out the main points of contact with DfE from assessment through to opening.</p>

<h4>Applications and assessment phase</h4>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Application is assessed by DfE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal interviews held (if successful in stage 1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval letter issued (if successful in stage 2).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Pre-opening phase</h4>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You will be allocated a DfE delivery officer to support and work with you towards opening the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free schools capital (FSC) finds and develops a site for the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust develops plans and meets legal requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An external expert (EE) will be appointed to provide professional advice and opinion as you develop and finalise your education and staffing plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding agreement signed by Secretary of State.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>School opening</h4>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your delivery officer is your main contact for the school, working with ESFA (on finance and governance) and possibly the free schools capital (FSC) team.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Types of free school</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to the following types of free school project in the pre-opening phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream (including primary, secondary, all-through and 16 to 19)</li>
  <li>special</li>
  <li>alternative provision</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some differences between the specific tasks that you will need to complete for certain pre-opening processes, depending on what type of school you are opening (for example, developing admission arrangements). Where this applies, this will be clearly indicated in this guidance.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a primary or all-through free school, there is an assumption that the proposed school will include a nursery. Throughout the guidance, sub-headings will clearly indicate the specific processes you must follow to successfully open your nursery.</p>

<p>This guidance also applies to presumption free school projects, (those where the local authority has identified the need for a school and run a competition to select a trust to run the school) in the pre-opening phase. However, there are some differences between the pre-opening processes for presumption free schools and central route free schools (those approved as part of an application wave) because local authorities play a greater role in the delivery of presumption free schools. If you are opening a presumption free school, you should also refer to the pre-opening section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/establishing-a-new-school-free-school-presumption">free school presumption</a> guidance, as this provides details of the differences to the pre-opening process.</p>

<p>DfE will work closely with the local authorities in which special free school projects are based and will invite local authority representatives to attend checkpoint meetings for these projects. This reflects the fact that local authorities are responsible for commissioning places at special free schools when they open.</p>

<p>There is separate pre-opening guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-open-a-maths-school">16 to 19 maths schools</a>, as the pre-opening processes that you will need to follow for these projects are different. If you are opening a 16 to 19 maths school, you should ensure that you refer to the correct pre-opening guidance for your project.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>All trusts will be assigned a delivery officer in DfE. Your delivery officer will help, advise and challenge you to ensure that your school will operate successfully once it is open, providing places in good new schools and system leadership where these are most needed, from day one. You will have regular interactions with your delivery officer, including a number of formal meetings at specified milestones. These formal meetings between trusts and DfE will normally be as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The initial kick-off meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A checkpoint meeting to determine the provisional opening date, once the site has been confirmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A checkpoint meeting, normally in the December or January before the provisional opening date, with a focus on pupil recruitment and other issues that need to be resolved before the Secretary of State will consider entering into a funding agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A readiness-to-open meeting (ROM), about 3 months before opening, to confirm that the school will open successfully.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>At all these meetings, DfE will assess your project’s overall progress, identify any important risks that might prevent the school from opening on time and operating successfully once open, and assess the costs incurred to date and expected future spend. DfE may set up additional meetings, depending on progress. DfE expect senior representation from the trust during these meetings.</p>

<p>You will also be allocated a contact from the Free Schools Capital (FSC) team to secure your site and the buildings for your school. This is covered in more detail in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#site">site and buildings</a>.</p>

<p>Annex A, published on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">main guidance page</a>, contains a project task checklist, which outlines the core tasks that need to be completed during pre-opening. The completion of these tasks at the appropriate time is critical to ensuring that your school can open successfully.</p>

<p>It is critical that you put in place robust planning and project management arrangements because the timetable for opening a free school is very demanding. Your delivery officer will request a copy of your project plan ahead of the kick-off meeting.</p>

<p>DfE recommend that you designate a specific person as responsible for managing your project, bringing together the various strands of activity, tracking progress and managing risks. You may use the project development grant (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#funding-and-finance">section 6)</a> to buy in project management support. More information about the procurement of additional project management support is provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#procurement-and-additional-support">section 7</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Determining the opening date of your school</h3>

<p>One of the important milestones in the pre-opening phase will be to agree your provisional opening date. You will have your own preferred opening date for your project, but you must agree with DfE what opening date you should use to market your school to parents. In most cases, agreement of your provisional opening date will only happen once a site has been confirmed (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#site">section 8</a>), and DfE have assessed the time needed for obtaining planning permission and completing necessary building works or refurbishment. When agreeing a provisional opening date, DfE will also consider whether the need for the school identified at assessment stage remains and if so, by when the new places the school will provide will be needed. For these reasons, you may need to be flexible about precisely where the school is located, as well as about the year of opening.</p>

<p>Once DfE have identified and confirmed a suitable site and carried out that assessment, after discussion with you, DfE will write confirming the provisional opening date. DfE will open a school in temporary accommodation only in a limited number of specific circumstances, details of these are provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#site">section 8</a>. DfE will normally arrange a meeting to discuss confirmation of the provisional opening date before issuing the formal letter.</p>

<p>Until a suitable site has been secured, DfE would expect you to maintain momentum by continuing to develop plans in parallel for issues such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>admission arrangements</li>
  <li>curriculum</li>
  <li>governance including reviewing memorandum and articles of association</li>
</ul>

<p>However, DfE would not normally expect you to undertake the following, which require confirmation of a site and provisional opening date, without prior agreement:</p>

<ul>

<h4>New Schools Network</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://newschoolsnetwork.org/" rel="external">New Schools Network</a> (NSN) receives a grant from DfE to provide free advice, tools, guidance and events to help you plan your approach to pre-opening, based on the experience of trusts that have successfully opened free schools. For more information on NSN’s support for free schools in pre-opening visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/preparing-to-open" rel="external">NSN website</a>, or contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@newschoolsnetwork.org">helpdesk@newschoolsnetwork.org</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Main risks during pre-opening</h2>

<p>DfE’s experience from opening over 500 free schools suggests that most projects share a set of important risks that will need to be monitored and managed during pre-opening. Your delivery officer will want to understand how you plan to manage each of these important risks. You should inform them immediately if any of these risks materialise during your time in pre-opening, so that they can help to resolve them and enable you to open a good, viable school on time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Summary of main risks</h3>

<p>This section summarises important risks.</p>

<h4>Leadership</h4>

<p>A high-quality principal designate is not recruited in the first or subsequent rounds of recruitment and as a result, is not appointed early enough to support and influence the development of school policies and education brief.</p>

<h4>Staffing</h4>

<p>Sufficient and suitable staff have not been recruited 6 months before opening, so, for example, by the March before a September opening date.</p>

<p>You wish to recruit staff before DfE has agreed to enter into a funding agreement.</p>

<h4>Governance</h4>

<p>A suitably skilled chair of trustees is not appointed 10 months before opening, so, for example, by the end of October for a September opening.</p>

<p>If you run an existing school or have another project in pre-opening and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are issued with a financial notice to improve (FNtI)</li>
  <li>a DfE official or external expert raises any concerns about it, for example, financial concerns that fall short of an FNtI but are still a concern, such as a forecast deficit</li>
  <li>Ofsted judge one or more of your existing schools as either requires improvement or inadequate</li>
  <li>there is a significant decline in the performance of one or more of your existing schools (for example, if your Progress 8 or Attainment 8 scores fall below agreed thresholds)</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not able to submit a complete governance plan 10 months before opening, so, for example, by October for a September opening.</p>

<h4>Pupil recruitment</h4>

<p>Marketing and recruitment plan targets have not been met, indicating that the school may be unviable upon opening.</p>

<p>Application numbers, at the application deadline date, indicate the school will not be viable.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong>
Application numbers are below DfE’s minimum viable numbers, which are 2 forms of entry with 30 pupils each for primary schools, and 4 forms of entry with 30 pupils each for secondary schools, or below the viable number to deliver your curriculum – whichever is the higher.</p>
</div>

<p>Accepted offer numbers, as of national offer day, indicate that the school will not be viable. In the case of AP or special schools, the number of referrals received from commissioners is low, making the school financially unviable (below DfE’s minimum viable number).</p>

<h4>Local factors</h4>

<p>Risks could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the local authority is or becomes unsupportive of the project</li>
  <li>local residents or schools raise significant opposition to your project during or following consultation</li>
  <li>opposition to the project attracts media attention</li>
  <li>your project is linked to a new housing development and issues have arisen with that development that may result in delays</li>
</ul>

<h4>Finance</h4>

<p>Risks could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are likely to run out of project development grant (PDG)</li>
  <li>a potential conflict of interest is identified when spending PDG (see separate guidance on procurement in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#procurement-and-additional-support">section 7</a>
</li>
  <li>you are unable to submit a viable financial plan ahead of the readiness to open meeting or at other important points as requested</li>
</ul>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>Risks could include that you fail to agree an education plan with your external expert.</p>

<h4>Admissions</h4>

<p>Risks could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you wish to adopt unconventional admission arrangements</li>
  <li>you wish be part of your local authority coordinated admissions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other risks</h4>

<p>The risks which have been presented in this section are not exhaustive. These are the most common risks but each individual project will have its own risks and you should discuss any concerns with your delivery officer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Governance</h2>

<p>This section covers governance arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook"> competency framework for governance</a> outlines the 6 most important features of effective governance, which you should consider when formulating your governance arrangements including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strategic leadership that sets vision, ethos and strategy</li>
  <li>accountability that drives up educational standards and financial performance</li>
  <li>people with the right skills, experience, qualities and capacity</li>
  <li>structures that reinforce clearly defined roles and responsibilities</li>
  <li>compliance with statutory and contractual requirements</li>
  <li>evaluation to monitor and improve the quality and impact of governance</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Guidance for governance arrangements</h3>

<p>A trust’s governance arrangements are laid out in its articles of association. DfE provides <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-model-memorandum-and-articles-of-association">model articles of association documents</a> for trusts to use. Church trusts should use the model articles <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/church-academies-model-documents">church academies model documents</a>. You will need to submit your trust’s articles of association, using the relevant model articles, to your delivery officer, along with the completed confirmation of model articles checklist (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide">Annex B</a>).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook</a> is guidance published by the DfE and sets the DfE’s vision and priorities for effective governance by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>outlining the core role and functions of the governing board</li>
  <li>summarising and providing a first point of reference of the duties placed on boards, signposting to more detailed information, guidance and resource</li>
  <li>providing information on the support available to boards</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be aware that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>every free school is run by an academy trust – a charitable company limited by guarantee</li>
  <li>the board of trustees must be constituted to have all the necessary skills for effective governance but be no bigger than necessary to achieve this</li>
  <li>there should be a minimum of 3 members and DfE’s strong preference is for trusts to have at least 5 members, and for at least a majority of members to be independent of the board</li>
  <li>no more than 19.9% of your members and 19.9% of your trustees should be associated with the local authority</li>
  <li>no members and no more than one third of trustees can be employees of the trust. DfE’s strong preference is that no employees other than the CEO should serve as trustees</li>
  <li>whether you are an established trust or a new trust, DfE expect you to adopt our latest model articles of association before signing a funding agreement</li>
  <li>DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">competency framework for governance and clerking competency framework</a> sets out the skills, knowledge and behaviours needed for effective governance and clerking</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Role of academy trusts, members and trustees</h3>

<p>All academy trusts, as charitable companies, have both trustees and members whose role is described in detail in the DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-structures-and-roles">academy trust 
governance - structures and role descriptors</a> and in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook</a> and summarised in this section.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Members</h3>

<p>Academy trusts are founded by members who have a general duty to exercise their powers to further the academy trust’s charitable purpose. The first members are the signatories to the memorandum of association which is drawn up when the academy trust is first established. These first members agree the academy trust’s first articles of association which set out the trust’s charitable purpose.</p>

<p>Members should not be involved in the day-to-day management of the trust but should ensure that they are sufficiently informed about the trust to be able to exercise their powers effectively.</p>

<p>Members have an important role in academy trust governance, based on a number of powers set out in DfE’s model articles of association and in company law. Members’ powers include the powers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appoint and remove trustees</li>
  <li>direct the academy trustees to act in certain circumstances</li>
  <li>to make changes to the articles (although permission from the Secretary of State or the Charity Commission will be required in some cases)</li>
</ul>

<p>The members’ role is similar to that of the shareholders in a company limited by shares. Trusts must be established with at least 3 members, although DfE’s strong preference is, wherever possible, for trusts to have at least 5 members. Having more members increases the range of perspectives represented and reduces the risk of concentrating power. It also ensures that the trust has enough members to take decisions via special resolution (where 75% of members agree) without requiring unanimity while minimising circumstances in which a split membership prevents decisions being taken by ordinary resolution (where at least 51% of the members are in favour).</p>

<p>Employees of the academy trust must not be members. No more than 19.9% of members can be local authority associated (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook</a> for further explanation).</p>

<p>As the responsibility to conduct the academy trust’s business sits with the academy trustees, it is important that members do not overstep their powers or undermine the trust board’s discretion when exercising its responsibilities. DfE expects the majority of, if not all, members to be independent of the board of trustees. This also enables members to exercise their powers objectively and reduces the risk of unchecked ‘group think’ by the board.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Board of trustees</h3>

<p>The trust board is the decision-making body of the academy trust and is accountable and responsible for the academy (or all the academies equally) in the academy trust. The board should focus strongly on the 3 core functions of governance set out in the governance handbook: setting the strategic priorities for the school; holding the senior leader to account; and ensuring that money is spent properly and effectively.</p>

<p>The trustees must ensure compliance with the trust’s charitable objects and with company and charity law and should provide members with sufficient information to assure the members that the board is exercising effective governance. The board of trustees signs off the annual accounts and is responsible for adherence to the trust’s funding agreement with the Secretary of State. It is the trustees who are therefore responsible for the trust’s accountability to Parliament and to the Secretary of State as the principal regulator of academies as exempt charities</p>

<p>The role of trustee requires commitment as well as the right experience and skills. DfE has developed a framework of the competencies, published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">competency framework for governance</a>, which are needed for effective governance.</p>

<p>Trusts need to put in place arrangements to ensure members and trustees avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible. Trusts need to be transparent, through a published register of interests, about all potential conflicts of interest and to manage them appropriately in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-essential-trustee-what-you-need-to-know-cc3">Charity Commission guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Parental representation</h4>

<p>The trust board must include 2 elected parent trustees. Alternatively, the board may decide that parental representation should be at local level, and therefore there must be 2 elected parents on each local governing body (LGB) within the trust. The process for electing and appointing parent trustees and parent local governors will be set out in the trust’s articles of association.</p>

<h4>Employees on the trust board</h4>

<p>No more than one third of the board can be employees of the academy. DfE’s strong preference is for no employees other than the principal or CEO to serve as trustees in order to retain clear lines of accountability through the academy trust’s single senior executive leader. No more than 19.9% of trustees can be local authority-associated.</p>

<h4>Committees</h4>

<p>An important consideration will be how to make the most effective use of committees, including, if you are a trust with more than one school, LGBs. Academy trusts must establish an audit and risk committee appointed by the trust board. The committee must include directing the academy trust’s programme of internal scrutiny. Bigger academy trusts (with an annual income over £50 million) must have a dedicated audit and risk committee. Other academy trusts must either have a dedicated audit and risk committee or can combine it with another committee. In addition, trust boards are expected to have a finance committee to which the trust board delegates financial scrutiny and oversight. Other areas of business covered by committees may include curriculum and attainment.</p>

<p>Trustees can formally delegate decision-making powers to a committee, in accordance with the trust’s articles, allowing it to make decisions on behalf of the board of trustees. Other committees may focus on specific issues and make recommendations to the trustees. Non-trustees can be co-opted onto committees and can vote on that committee, although (except in the case of LGBs) the majority of committee members must be trustees.</p>

<p>Committees can, therefore, be a helpful way to bring additional expertise to support the trustees. Your decision on whether to establish a committee should be based solely on the needs of your trust and the skills of your trustees. It is important to remember that the board of trustees retains overall accountability, regardless of what powers it delegates to any committee.</p>

<p>As an alternative to a standing committee, you could consider setting up a working group to offer advice to the trustees on specific issues or to give a voice to a particular group, such as parents or the community. Because of its informal nature it can be easier to stand down a working group once an issue has been resolved, which avoids unnecessary demands on people’s time. You cannot delegate decision-making powers to a working group.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Local governing bodies (LGBs)</h3>

<p>Trusts with multiple academies may establish a type of committee known as aLocal governing body (LGB). In some trusts LGBs may be known locally as ‘academy committees’ or ‘local advisory committees’. Trusts may decide to set up one or more LGBs and through a Scheme of Delegation will decide the responsibilities delegated to them. This can vary from a high level of delegation to wholly advisory LGBs. LGBs can be set up at academy level or across a group of academies. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-structures-and-roles">governance structures and role descriptors</a> guidance sets out more information.</p>

<p>Governance structures that span more than one school can bring significant benefits and allow you to make the most of the skills and experience of your best people.</p>

<p>Where a trust is establishing a free school to be overseen by a LGB, DfE will expect the board to be as rigorous in selecting its local governors and setting its operating arrangements as you would be in establishing a board of trustees for a single free school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>Clerk (governance professional) to the trustees</h3>

<p>You are required to appoint a clerk (governance professional) to advise and support the trust board. In a trust, the governance professional shall not be the trustee, principal or chief executive of the trust. They will receive direction from, and are accountable to, the board.</p>

<p>The governance professional will administer and support board meetings and provide advice and guidance on the board’s statutory and strategic functions which will enable the board to be compliant with legal process.</p>

<p>The governance professional is also responsible for ensuring that each meeting of the board of trustees is formally recorded and clear on the matters discussed and the actions approved.</p>

<p>The governance professional will also help the board understand its role, functions and legal duties and will support the chair to enable and facilitate strategic debate and decision making. More information on the range of skills, knowledge and expected behaviours of the governance professional can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">clerking competency framework</a>.</p>

<p>Consider these following questions relating to governance professional:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what type of governance support does the trust board, and its committees require, now and in the future?</li>
  <li>what are the skills and experience you require of the postholder?</li>
  <li>how will they be employed?</li>
  <li>how will they work with the trust leaders, including the Chair, in undertaking the work of the board?</li>
  <li>how will the Chair oversee the performance of the governance professionals in their clerking role?</li>
  <li>how committed are the board to supporting the development of their governance professional?</li>
  <li>what professional development will the governance professional require to ensure their knowledge and practice is kept up-to-date?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>The 7 principles of public life</h3>

<p>As explained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a>, there are 7 principles of public life that set out the standards of behaviour expected of anyone who holds public office, including those who work in education. The 7 principles of public life are: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. You can find out more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life">7 principles of public life</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>Summary of the main tasks</h3>

<p>This section contains a summary of the main tasks.</p>

<h4>Making sure you have established your academy trust properly</h4>

<p>The academy trust will be the signatory to the funding agreement and the legal owner of various assets. Setting up your academy trust allows you to open a company bank account, into which DfE will pay your project development grant (PDG) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#due-diligence">(see section 4)</a>). You should have set up your trust before submitting your free school application.</p>

<p>The articles of association describe your trust’s constitution and establish the framework of your governance arrangements. DfE’s model articles have been designed to follow best practice in corporate, charitable and school governance. That is why our expectation is that you will adopt our model articles to establish your academy trust. Trusts moving from having one school to having a number of schools will also be expected to move to DfE’s model master and supplemental funding agreements when the time comes to sign the funding agreement for their new free school. Established trusts must move to DfE’s latest model master funding agreement for the new free schools and any future free schools or academies, if they are not already on the latest model.</p>

<p>If your group is an existing academy trust and therefore has its own articles of association, DfE would expect you to adopt the latest model articles if this is not the one being used. If your group is a new trust, you should also adopt the latest model. Your delivery officer will discuss with you any particular governance issues that you will need to consider.
The model articles are flexible enough to accommodate most governance models adopted by free school proposers. Your delivery officer will need to be satisfied that your articles of association are in line with our latest model and have not been changed before recommending that the Secretary of State enters into a funding agreement to open your free school.
Your delivery officer will ask to see a governance plan to examine structure, roles and responsibilities, and details of internal controls, and to look at pen portraits of governors and any skills gaps and vacancies. The plan should be submitted with a completed <a class="govuk-link" href="#_Annex_C:_Governance">checklist</a>, signed by the lead proposer or chair of governors, which ensures your plan contains the level of detail DfE require. Your delivery officer will ask you throughout the pre-opening phase how trustees are managing the transition from pre- to post-opening. You should talk to your delivery officer if you are experiencing difficulties developing the governance plan or if you think you will fail to submit a final version 8 months before opening, (for example, by the January for a September opening or by August for an April opener). It is possible that your delivery officer will ask you to submit your plan before this time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span>Size of your board of trustees</h3>

<p>Consider these points for your governance plans.</p>

<h4>Members</h4>

<p>Consider these following questions relating to members:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are there at least 3 (DfE strongly recommend at least 5), including:
    <ul>
      <li>whether they meet guidelines around employees and local authority associated individuals?</li>
      <li>whether there is significant separation between members and trustees to enable members to exercise their powers objectively?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>do the plans demonstrate a clear understanding of the role of the member (and what is not their role)?</li>
  <li>if a sponsor member is listed, is it a DfE-approved sponsor? (Corporate members are considered on a case-by-case basis, check with your delivery officer)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Trustees</h4>

<p>Consider these following questions relating to trustees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the trust board an adequate size to oversee the strategic business of the trust?</li>
  <li>will the majority of members be independent from the board and if there is cross-over, do you have strategies in place for ensuring independent challenge?</li>
  <li>do the arrangements reflect the memorandum and articles?</li>
  <li>s there a chair of the trust board in place, including, do they have the right experience, skills and knowledge?</li>
  <li>are the other trustees suitably skilled, including whether you have Ofsted reports and academic results for other schools with which trustees have been involved?</li>
  <li>has a skills audit been carried out to identify skills gaps in the existing trustees, including whether this will be used as a basis for trustee training and recruitment?</li>
  <li>if any trustees are also employees of the trust, including the CEO, is the total number of trustees who are employees no more than one third of the total number of trustees? (This is to retain clear lines of accountability through the trust’s single senior executive leader - more information on this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook</a>, page 55 paragraph 5.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of trustees you need should be determined by the needs of your particular free school. The board of trustees should only be as big as it needs to be to ensure it has the full range of skills it needs to be effective. Between 7 and 12 high-calibre trustees should be sufficient to manage your trust effectively. Any specialist knowledge can be provided as and when it is required by committees or other experts, such as the governance professional to the trustees or the trust’s legal advisers.</p>

<p>While there are no legal limits to the size of your board, you should expect your delivery officer to challenge you if the number of trustees set out in your articles is greater than 12. DfE will want to be assured that any larger body is justified, according to the likely demands of running your free school. Your delivery officer may suggest that you ask some individuals to stand down if it is not clear that they will bring essential skills to the board of trustees, or if they judge the size of the group to be unwieldy.</p>

<p>In establishing an LGB, you should ask yourself the same questions about size, skills and structures as you would when setting up a board of trustees for trust with only one school. You should also consider what, if any, responsibilities should be delegated from the trust board to the LGB, avoiding duplication or overlap between the role of LGBs and the board in holding executive leaders to account. These should be set out in a clear written scheme of delegation published on your website. While you may delegate responsibilities to an LGB, the trust board remains accountable for what is delegated. People appointed to LGBs are not trustees unless they sit on the trust board.</p>

<h4>Ensuring you are recruiting the right people as trustees</h4>

<p>You need to ensure that the people you recruit as trustees understand the requirements of the role and have the commitment, experience and skills to be effective. DfE has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/583733/Competency_framework_for_governance_.pdf">competency framework for governance</a> setting out the competencies needed for effective governance and you should consider this when appointing trustees. Your delivery officer will want to be clear about the skills and experience each trustee brings and what role they will fulfil.</p>

<p>The attributes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">outlined in the framework</a> will be particularly important for the person you recruit as your chair of the trust board. The chair’s relationships with the principal and the trust members are important to effective accountability between the trustees and the trust, and between the trust’s members and board of trustees. DfE and National Governance Association (NGA) guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/leading-governors-the-role-of-the-chair-of-governors">Leading governors: the role of the chair of governors in schools and academies</a> will provide a useful guide to the skills you need to look for in a chair and help them settle into the role on appointment.</p>

<p>The trustees of a free school need to be assured that its financial systems, transactions and risks are being adequately assessed and addressed. Trustees are also responsible for establishing internal controls that recognise public expectations about governance, financial management and financial probity, and expectations on the stewardship of public funds by ESFA’s accounting officer and Parliament. More information on how a free school can check that their financial and other controls are operating effectively can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Your delivery officer will want to see evidence of the steps you have taken to ensure that the trust board includes individuals from a range of different backgrounds, so that a diverse range of perspectives are represented. Having some people on the board who come from outside the faith or ethnic group of the majority of pupils can help ensure that the board has sufficient internal challenge to the decisions it makes and how it carries out its strategic functions. In addition, boards must ensure they understand the full diversity of the school’s cultural and religious context and that of the community it serves.</p>

<p>Parent trustees are elected by other parents or carers, not the trust, but they are expected to act in the best interests of the trust in the same way as all other trustees. They take on the same responsibilities as every other trustee, so it is vital that you do what you can to ensure that candidates understand the role and have the necessary skills and commitment. The term of office is 4 years.</p>

<p>Most free school proposers dedicate some of their PDG to trustee training – something that DfE strongly recommend you do. You may want to consider signing your trust or LGB chairs up to one of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/school-governors-professional-development">governance leadership development programmes</a>that are funded by DfE. The programme is delivered by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/licensees-professional-development-for-school-governors/licensees-professional-development-for-school-governors">DfE-contracted providers</a>and are available in every region. Enrolment takes place on a regular basis.</p>

<h4>Finding trustees</h4>

<p>DfE funds <a class="govuk-link" href="http://inspiringgovernance.org/" rel="external">Inspiring Governance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.academyambassadors.org/" rel="external">Academy Ambassadors</a>to support boards in finding suitable trustees. Inspiring Governance is a free, online self-matching service for people who are interested in volunteering as a governor, and for board’s smaller trusts seeking to recruit new trustees. Academy Ambassadors provides a targeted match-making service between potential non-executive directors and trusts, helping to grow successful academy groups sustainably.</p>

<p>In recruiting your board of trustees, you should aim to have recruited a capable chair and identified the majority of your trustees at least 6 months before your school’s provisional opening date. This does not include parent trustees, who you can appoint during the first term post-opening. Your delivery officer will challenge you on progress with trustee appointments throughout the pre-opening period and governance will be an important focus at your readiness-to-open meeting, where the chair will be expected to play a full part in the discussion, alongside the principal designate.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to appoint as trustees, individuals who make a strong contribution to the pre-opening project team. This can be appropriate, but only if you are confident that an individual will make a full contribution as a trustee in the longer term, based on their skills and experience. If not, there are other ways to involve supporters and give people a say over the running of the school, for example as non-trustees sitting on committees, or on informal working groups reporting to the trustees.</p>

<h4>Trustees’ commitments, post-opening</h4>

<p>You will need to ensure you have trustees with sufficient capacity, particularly in pre-opening and the early years of the trust, to undertake their commitment to the role, which can be significant.</p>

<p>The burden on individual trustees can be reduced through effective use of committees and working groups. They can work on behalf of the trustees to explore specific areas of interest, make recommendations to the board of trustees, or take decisions on the board of trustees’ behalf.</p>

<h4>The transition from pre- to post-opening</h4>

<p>During pre-opening some trustees take on additional responsibilities as part of the project team. This contribution can be vital and is welcomed, but it will be important to ensure that trustees understand the need to take a more strategic role as the free school moves towards opening. To support this, having a transition plan in place can help trustees to make the necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>Taking a strategic role is not just about handing over plans to the principal designate and senior leaders. An important task for your trustees during pre-opening will be to think about how they will monitor and assess the school’s strengths, weaknesses and progress, and how they will support and challenge the principal designate and senior leadership team.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span>Prompts for your governance plans</h3>

<p>Consider these points.</p>

<h4>Board structure</h4>

<p>You may want to consider these following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the board structure clear to all, do trustees clearly understand their role and that of the governance support?</li>
  <li>does it reflect the 3 core strategic functions of a board ensuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction, financial oversight, holding the school leadership to account for the educational performance of the school?</li>
  <li>is the level at which the responsibilities of the board will be executed or delegated to committees or individuals clear, for example, does the plan include a delegated decision planner and do all those involved in governance understand their responsibilities within the structure?</li>
  <li>have the terms of reference for committees been developed, including:
    <ul>
      <li>are there link trustees?</li>
      <li>in which areas?</li>
      <li>is their role clear?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To help your trustees begin to define their role as strategic leaders, DfE recommend focusing first on the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook</a> which describes the role and duties of governors and trustees in academies. The all-party Parliamentary Group on Governance has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nga.org.uk/getmedia/028dfea6-8313-4339-96ed-fa61e0769fe4/Twenty-questions-second-edition-2015.pdf" rel="external">a list of 20 questions for a governing body to ask itself</a>, covering membership and skills, focus and activities. Some questions will be more appropriate as a prompt for review and continuous improvement, once the school opens, but most will be useful in helping you to plan during pre-opening. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework">education inspection framework</a> from Ofsted is also helpful on the wider picture of what the trustees are responsible for overseeing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.12 </span>Leadership</h3>

<h4>Senior executive leader</h4>

<p>You will be required to appoint a senior executive leader (SEL) in practice also known as the principal, executive principal or CEO. The SEL must be the head of the line management executive chain and held accountable by the board of trustees for the performance of the whole trust. The SEL should also be the trust’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-handbook/part-1-roles-and-responsibilities">accounting officer</a>. The SEL role must not rotate between individuals, although it may be filled by a job-share.</p>

<p>The appointment of a SEL does not require an additional person to be employed. In trusts with only one school, the SEL will be the principal. For trusts with more than one school, the SEL could continue to be the principal of an individual academy within the trust while also acting as CEO. It is important to remember that there is no ‘lead school’ in a trust. The board must not favour or show allegiance to one school but foster a common ethos and vision across the whole trust. The appointment of an accounting officer or SEL does not remove the responsibility of the board of trustees for the proper conduct and financial operation of the trust.</p>

<h4>Accounting officer</h4>

<p>Each free school trust must designate a named individual as its accounting officer. The trust, on appointment of the accounting officer (AO), is responsible for ensuring that the AO undertakes sufficient training to undertake the role. In single free schools, this should be the principal. If a free school is joining a trust, it should be the senior executive leader. This role may be filled by a job-share.</p>

<p>The role of the accounting officer includes a personal responsibility to ESFA’s accounting officer and to Parliament for the financial resources under the free school’s control. The free school’s accounting officer must be able to assure ESFA’s accounting officer, Parliament and the public of high standards of probity in the management of public funds. This requires the free school’s accounting officer to have appropriate oversight, alongside the board of trustees, of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the establishment, maintenance and monitoring of the free school’s internal control arrangements</li>
  <li>ensuring the free school’s assets and property are under proper control</li>
  <li>reducing the risk or fraud or irregularity</li>
  <li>keeping full and accurate accounting records to ensure ongoing viability</li>
</ul>

<p>The free school’s accounting officer is also required to sign:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statement on regularity, propriety and compliance which is included in the free school’s audited annual accounts</li>
  <li>an annual value for money statement explaining and demonstrating with examples how the free school has secured value for money</li>
</ul>

<p>It is, therefore, very important that the trustees of the free school establish robust internal control arrangements leading to the efficient clearance of these documents.</p>

<p>More detail on the role of the accounting officer and how this can be discharged can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nasbm.co.uk/Home/EfA-Academies-Library.aspx" rel="external">Institute of School Business Leadership’s website</a>.</p>

<h4>Chief finance officer (CFO)</h4>

<p>Free schools must demonstrate capacity in their governance and financial management structures to safeguard public funds. An integral element is that free schools must appoint a chief finance officer (CFO) who will act as the trust’s finance director, business manager or equivalent, to lead on financial matters. However, in smaller free schools it may not be possible to justify the salary of a CFO. Trustees can elect to have this position filled by employing staff or contractors with relevant skills or knowledge at the appropriate time, provided that effective governance and robust financial management is preserved. More detail on the role of the CFO can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nasbm.co.uk/Home/EfA-Academies-Library.aspx" rel="external">Institute of School Business Leadership’s website.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.13 </span>Delivering assurance</h3>

<p>Academy trusts must have in place a process for checking their financial systems, controls, transactions and risks. This programme of risk review and checking of financial controls can be managed in the way that you deem most appropriate in your circumstances. Options include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appointment of an internal audit service (either in-house, bought-in or provided by a sponsor)</li>
  <li>the performance of a supplementary programme of work by the trust’s external auditor</li>
  <li>the appointment of a non-employed trustee with an appropriate level of qualifications or experience to check the trust’s internal controls, who neither charges, nor is paid by the trust for their work - this appointment is not mandatory but this is one way that trusts are able to conduct their internal checks</li>
  <li>a peer review, with the work being performed by the CFO, or a suitably qualified or experienced member of the finance team, from another academy trust, as an independent reviewer</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information on internal scrutiny can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.14 </span>Conflicts of interest</h3>

<p>A conflict of interest can be defined as ‘any situation in which a trustee’s personal interests, or interests that they owe to another body, may (or may appear to) influence or affect their decision-making’.</p>

<p>It is inevitable that conflicts of interest will arise at some time. Even the perception of a conflict of interest can damage your trust’s reputation. Your priority should be to ensure that your trustees understand their responsibilities for managing public money, which are set out in detail in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a> and include putting the right mechanisms in place to identify and manage conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Conflicts are most likely to arise where trustees or their relatives intend to provide goods or services to the trust, or where a trustee’s personal, family or professional relationships will, could, or might be seen to compromise their ability to act solely in the interests of the trust. The latter could be caused by the appointments you make - for example, a couple who take the role of chair of trustees and finance director, or where a trustee owns, is employed by or has a personal relationship with a third party seeking to contract with the trust. Your delivery officer will challenge any appointment they feel creates an unacceptably high risk of a conflict for your trust, but the responsibility is yours and DfE will expect you to ensure that the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any individual or organisation represented as a member or trustee of your academy trust, or with influence over the trust through other means, understands that they will only be able to bid for contracts from the trust on an ‘at cost’ basis (this is in line with the approach taken by DfE with approved academy sponsors)</li>
  <li>trustees comply with the protocols set out at articles 6, 97 and 98 of the model articles, which ensure that decisions are taken without bias and that individuals who are ‘conflicted’ take steps to avoid influencing a decision</li>
  <li>trustees establish and maintain a register of interests to identify and record potential areas of conflict – the register should be completed and kept up to date by all trustees and any staff with budgetary control, covering them and their family members (this will show that your trust’s decisions are being made free from conflict) – the register of interests should be a standing item at every meeting of the board of trustees</li>
  <li>trustees and members understand the need for all procurement to follow an open and fair competition (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#procurement-and-additional-support">section 7</a> for further information). The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/manage-a-conflict-of-interest-in-your-charity">Charity Commission</a> has also produced helpful guidance on identifying and avoiding conflicts of interest</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>DfE will take very seriously any failure to manage conflicts of interest properly, whether these are real or perceived. Negligence in relation to this could ultimately lead to the cancellation of the project.</p>
</div>

<h4>Related-party transactions</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a> sets out reporting and approval requirements for academy trusts in advance of transacting with a related party.</p>

<p>Academy trusts must declare their intention to enter into a new agreement before confirming the transaction with a related-party supplier to the ESFA. This includes agreements being renewed with a related-party supplier.</p>

<p>Academy trusts do not need to declare income transactions with related parties. For expenditure related-party transactions with a new supplier, academy trusts must confirm whether they have previously received a donation from the related party.</p>

<p>In line with paragraph 5.42 of the academies financial handbook, salaries and other payments made by an academy trust to a related party under a contract of employment, through the academy trust’s payroll, are not in scope of this reporting requirement.</p>

<p>Academy trusts must continue to report all related-party transactions, regardless of value, in their annual financial statements as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-accounts-direction">academies accounts direction</a>.</p>

<p>Academy trusts must seek prior approval from ESFA when a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>single proposed contract or agreement with a related party exceeds £20,000</li>
  <li>proposed contract or agreement of any value means the total value of contracts or agreements with the same related party exceeds £20,000 in a financial year</li>
</ul>

<p>A series of intended transactions with the same supplier can be submitted as a single request for approval, as long as sufficient detail about each transaction is included in the evidence provided.</p>

<p>Academy trusts must declare or seek approval for related-party transactions using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/onlinecollections/" rel="external">online form</a>.</p>

<p>You need to have all your information and documents ready before starting, as it’s not possible to complete part of the form and return to it. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/related-party-transactions-information-for-academy-trusts/checklist-information-needed-before-completing-the-on-line-form">checklist</a> sets out the type of evidence you may need to provide when seeking approval for a related-party transaction.</p>

<p>You need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account">register for an IDAMS</a> account to use the form and to approve other users.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.15 </span>How DfE will work with you</h3>

<p>Your delivery officer will:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Need confirmation that your trust has been established and that your articles are in line with DfE’s latest model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the proposed size of your board of trustees and request to see the governance structure – they will challenge you on any amendments, or if your proposed board of trustees looks unnecessarily large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask you to confirm the names of any members and trustees you have already appointed – you are required to advise Companies House within 14 days of appointing a director (your trustees are your directors) and to advise DfE within 14 days of any change (appointment or removal) of any trustee or member of the trust (the Charity Commission does not regulate academy trusts, so you should not seek to register the trust with the Commission or provide them with details of your members and trustees).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenge you should any concerns arise about an individual’s appointment, including where DfE has a concern about a potential conflict of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expect you to have drawn up plans for how your board of trustees will operate, including plans for committees. They will also want to hear how your plans for recruiting a chair and other trustees are progressing. At this stage, your delivery officer will also expect you to have put in place effective procedures for managing conflicts of interest, including setting up a register of interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expect you to have resolved any concerns regarding the constitution or size of your board of trustees. You will have completed an initial trustee skills audit as part of your application and your delivery officer will want to see evidence that you have reviewed this as new trustees are appointed and have confirmed which gaps remain. They will also want to know what plans you have to recruit and train your trustees to ensure you have sufficient skills and experience in place. They will be particularly keen to understand your plans to recruit a chair. They will also ask for updates on trustee appointments, and for a pen-portrait of each new trustee, setting out their skills and track record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expect you to have recruited the chair of trustees at least 8 months before your school’s opening date, who should be working with the principal designate, and have identified or appointed the majority of remaining trustees and support staff (such as the clerk, and a responsible officer). As a minimum, you will need to have a workable plan to fill outstanding vacancies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In recommending to ministers that they enter into a funding agreement, your delivery officer will need to provide assurance and evidence that your governance arrangements are appropriate and rigorous, and that you have recruited high calibre trustees.</p>

<p>As the school moves towards opening, your trustees should be working with the principal designate on the board of trustees’ important documents and protocols ahead of the first board of trustees meeting. These will include the school’s development and improvement plan and a scheme of delegation (the document that confirms any delegation of spending and other decision-making powers from the board of trustees to committees or employees).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Due diligence</h2>

<p>Proposers must comply with the 7 principles of public life that set out the standards of behaviour expected of anyone who holds public office, including those who work in education.The 7 principles of public life are: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. You can find out more about them at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life">7 principles of public life</a>.</p>

<p>DfE will carry out a number of checks on those applying to establish a free school to provide reassurance of the suitability to manage public money and run a school. These will include due diligence checks, financial checks, Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks and other checks necessary to ensure that free schools are only set up and run by those who are suitable and able to do so.</p>

<p>There are several distinct actions for members and trustees to take as part of the due diligence process. You should engage with these requirements proactively and early on in the process to avoid delays in the Secretary of State signing a funding agreement with your trust or opening your school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Action required – for the chair of trustees</h3>

<p>The chair of trustees is responsible for ensuring that:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>They <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks-guidance-for-applicants">apply for a suitability check</a>. This includes a new enhanced DBS check provided by the DfE’s supplier, as well as checks on their identity and right to work in the United Kingdom. This is necessary regardless of checks performed by other DBS Registered Bodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All trustees or members have correctly completed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-applications-suitability-and-declarations">suitability and declarations form</a> and hold or have applied for an enhanced DBS certificate (provided by any DBS Registered Body).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The following sections provide more information about what is required and the process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Suitability and declarations form</h3>

<p>DfE carries out suitability checks on members and trustees of a trust setting up a free school while they are in pre-opening. All members and trustees, when appointed must complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-applications-suitability-and-declarations">suitability and declarations form</a>. This does not apply to members of LGBs unless the individual is also a trustee. The chair of trustees must take responsibility for ensuring that all sections of the form are complete, declaration pages are signed, and a passport-sized picture for each individual is provided to DfE. All completed documents should be scanned as a PDF and emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:due.diligence@education.gov.uk">due.diligence@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>During the pre-opening phase if there are any changes to the members and trustees, the chair of trustees must report these changes by email to the delivery officer as soon as possible.
Once a free school is open there is no need to send in suitability and declaration forms for new members and trustees.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks</h3>

<p>The Independent Schools Standards and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">Keeping children safe in education</a> require that the chair of trustees must hold an enhanced DBS certificate provided by the Secretary of State’s approved supplier (part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks-using-galaxkey-to-provide-your-supporting-evidence-to-esfa">suitability checks</a>).</p>

<p>All other members and trustees must hold an enhanced DBS certificate provided by any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dbs-ub-directory.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">DBS Registered Body</a>. On appointment, new members and trustees must obtain a new enhanced DBS certificate, even if they already hold one. All other members and trustees must have an enhanced DBS certificate. The chair of trustees must ensure that these requirements are met. The chair of trustees must also assess whether any offences or police information disclosed on a certificate are such than an individual is not suitable to hold the role of member or trustee.</p>

<p>In the case of the principal designate, checks should be performed as they would be for any other employee of the school. DfE does not require a copy of the certificate. The school is required to ensure that all relevant checks (including vetting and barring checks) are conducted in line with safeguarding requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Applying for an enhanced DBS check</h3>

<h4>Chair of trustees</h4>

<p>Academy trust chairs of trustees (not a chair of a local governing body) must complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks-guidance-for-applicants">suitability check</a> with the ESFA as soon as they are appointed. This is to comply with legislation and to keep children safe in education. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-handbook/part-2-main-financial-requirements">academies financial handbook</a> sets out a requirement to update governance information (including direct contact details) within 14 calendar days of a change. Free schools in the pre-opening stage will not be able to do this as the school will not become available on GIAS until a successful Ofsted pre-registration inspection has been carried out.</p>

<p>There’s further guidance which explains the process to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks-using-galaxkey-to-provide-your-supporting-evidence-to-esfa">apply for a suitability check</a>. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an identify check</li>
  <li>evidence to prove your right to work in the United Kingdom (UK)</li>
  <li>the outcome of a new enhanced DBS check performed by the DfE’s approved supplier</li>
  <li>if you have lived outside of the UK, an overseas criminal records check or certificate of good character</li>
</ul>

<p>When completing a suitability check DfE, will consider any further information available to us, including where individuals are barred from teaching or the management of a school.</p>

<h4>All other members and trustees</h4>

<p>Members and trustees (other than the chair of trustees) who already hold an enhanced DBS certificate dated within the past 2 years should email a scanned copy of the certificate to the chair of trustees. The Secretary of State requires the chair to ensure that all members and trustees present an up-to-date DBS certificate at all times, and DfE reserves the right to request sight of members’ DBS certificates at our discretion</p>

<p>On appointment, new members and trustees must apply for an enhanced DBS certificate, using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://dbs-ub-directory.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">DBS umbrella body directory</a>, even if they already have a certificate which has been issued within the last 2 years.</p>

<p>Once received, the certificate should be scanned and emailed to the chair of trustees.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Statutory duty to consult</h2>

<p>By law, your trust must meet its statutory obligation to consult under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/32/section/10" rel="external">Section 10 of the Academies Act 2010</a> (the Act) about your free school proposal.</p>

<p>Section 10 of the Act requires the trust to consult with the people they think appropriate, on whether to enter into an arrangement with the Secretary of State to set up and expand the free school.</p>

<p>It is worth recognising that there are some instances where this may not apply as set out in Section 10(1) of the Act.</p>

<p>The statutory consultation should inform appropriate persons about the project. This process is very useful as you will be able to use and build on the feedback and suggestions you receive. It should also help to raise awareness of your project and your marketing activity could help to increase pupil numbers.</p>

<p>You should speak to your delivery officer if you experience significant opposition by local residents during or following the consultation, or if the local authority becomes unsupportive of the project.</p>

<p>There is no requirement on you to carry out a Section 10 consultation in respect of a nursery that is part of your free school. However, it would be useful to mention the nursery as part of your consultation, as responses could help provide evidence of viability or highlight risks. It could also help marketing and local awareness-raising.</p>

<p>The duty to consult rests solely with you. DfE does not direct or provide specific advice to trusts on how you should go about it. There are some general themes you might want to think about, which are set out in the following paragraphs. You may also wish to refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/255180/Consultation-Principles-Oct-2013.pdf" rel="external">Cabinet Office good practice consultation guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Summary of the main tasks</h3>

<p>It is important to invest some time to plan how you will run your consultation, to ensure this complies with your statutory duty. Your consultation must be thorough and transparent.</p>

<p>You also need to decide whether you will carry out the consultation yourself or bring in additional resources to do this on your behalf. Above all, you will need to decide when to carry out your consultation, how long it will take, whom you will consult with, the policies and information about your school on which to consult and how you will collect responses to the consultation. You will need to be ready to consider any responses received and whether it is appropriate to adjust your plans, taking into account any concerns resulting from the consultation.</p>

<p>You should report and present your findings and conclusions to those that have responded, the local community and DfE.  The report should be submitted to DfE with a completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">checklist</a>, signed by the lead proposer or chair of governors. You should ensure your report contains an appropriate level of detail.</p>

<p>The question you should ask those you consult with is whether your trust should set up the free school. You should provide information on the particular proposals for your free school.</p>

<h4>Who needs to be consulted</h4>

<p>The Act states that you should consult such persons as the trust thinks appropriate. This includes any groups or individuals that may be affected by the opening of your school. Examples include nearby schools, the local authority, any surrounding local authorities, local community groups with an interest, the local population and faith groups.</p>

<h4>How long the consultation should be</h4>

<p>This is not specified but must be adequate to allow people time to consider the proposal and respond.</p>

<h4>When you should consult</h4>

<p>It must be done before the funding agreement can be signed, but when plans are sufficiently advanced, to enable those whom you consult to have sufficient understanding of the school that you are proposing.</p>

<h4>What to consult on</h4>

<p>Examples of areas to consult on include staff recruitment, admission arrangements, special educational needs (SEN) and other policies and the site for the school (or at least a general location).</p>

<h4>How to consult</h4>

<p>It is important that you give as many people as possible an opportunity to respond. You may therefore use a variety of channels, such as mailshots, leaflets, social media, open meetings, media announcements or a combination of all of these. Many trusts set up websites for the consultation, but you should make sure that the consultation is also available to those without a computer or the internet. You may also want to consider translating the consultation materials into other languages if the school being proposed is in an area with a diverse population. Finally, you should be able to provide accessible versions, for example a braille version of the consultation, on request.</p>

<h4>How to deal with responses</h4>

<p>You need to build in time to consider responses and whether it is appropriate to make any changes or additions to the plans for the school.</p>

<h4>How to report on the outcome</h4>

<p>Once the responses to the consultation have been analysed you will need to consider how the findings will be presented to both DfE and other interested parties. The most effective way is to produce a report of the important findings that provides quantitative and qualitative information, details of methods, timings, who you consulted, the questions you asked and any steps that have been taken because of the responses. You will then need to consider how you will publish the outcome of your consultation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>How DfE will work with you</h3>

<p>When the time comes to decide whether to enter into a funding agreement with your trust, the thoroughness and transparency of the consultation will form an important part of that decision.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State is required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/32/crossheading/academies-other-provisions" rel="external">Section 9 of the Act,</a> to complete an assessment of the impact that the opening of the free school will have on maintained schools, academies, institutions within the further education sector and alternative provision in the area in which the institution is proposed to be, or is, situated. This will incorporate any related evidence from your consultation. You do not need to do this - your delivery officer is responsible for carrying out the impact assessment at the appropriate time.</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Funding and finance</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>This chapter provides information on the project development grant (PDG), financial governance and accountability, risk protection arrangements and school financial planning.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the funding that projects receive is public money and you will need to be able to demonstrate that the way you use it meets high standards of propriety, is transparent and defensible and secures good value for money</li>
  <li>you must effectively plan and manage expenditure during pre-opening, including meeting the terms of the PDG agreement</li>
  <li>you must put in place robust governance arrangements and accounting procedures to allow the school to manage public funding responsibly once open</li>
  <li>you must develop a financial plan that demonstrates the school’s viability on opening within the available funding based on a realistic and evidenced number of pupils, realistic staffing requirements and an up-to-date estimate of expenditure, which should be considered jointly with the development of your curriculum</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Risks</h3>

<p>Mainstream free schools are funded on the basis of pupil number estimates while they are growing. When a school recruits fewer pupils than estimate or funded for, ESFA will recover the associated funding. This will be based on the October schools census and any excess funding will be clawed back in the following year. It’s important to note that if this affects your school, you will need to make sure you are able to pay that amount back the following year; if not, this can lead to financial problems.</p>

<p>Schools that have under-recruited pupils can also have financial viability issues if their plans do not have sufficient flexibility. DfE will not open a school where it does not believe the school will recruit enough pupils to be financially viable.</p>

<p>The pupil recruitment, funding arrangements and risks involved in opening special and alternative provision free schools are different, but DfE will assess these risks and will not open such schools if the financial viability is in doubt. Your delivery officer will discuss these with you as a minimum at the main checkpoints.</p>

<p>Projects in pre-opening receive PDG to cover all pre-opening costs (minus capital). If a trust runs out of PDG, DfE will not provide additional funding, except in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>This is a summary of the main funding areas. There’s more detailed information in the sections that follow.</p>

<h4>Project development grant (PDG)</h4>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this is for essential non-capital pre-opening revenue costs</li>
  <li>rates depend on type of school</li>
  <li>there’s an initial allocation of £30,000</li>
  <li>full allocation only given once provisional opening date agreed and heads of terms have been agreed for site</li>
  <li>projects need to submit budget profiles and statements of expenditure as requested by delivery officer</li>
</ul>

<h4>Financial plans</h4>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial plans should be based on delivered educational outcomes</li>
  <li>
    <p>plans are assessed by DfE at important points during pre-opening</p>
  </li>
  <li>DfE must be satisfied that the school will be financially viable before entering into a funding agreement</li>
</ul>

<h4>Understanding financial management</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a> sets out financial management and governance requirements.</p>

<h4>Financial statements submitted to ESFA</h4>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-accounts-direction">academies account direction</a> describes the form and content of statements</li>
  <li>you need to be aware of the main submission and publication deadlines</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Essential information you need to provide to DfE</h3>

<p>Throughout pre-opening, projects will be required to provide DfE with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>budget profiles and statements of expenditure for PDG</li>
  <li>financial plans with supporting assumptions, demonstrating the school’s financial viability when it opens</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Project development grant</h3>

<p>In the run up to opening, DfE will provide a fixed-rate PDG to cover essential non-capital costs up to the point at which the school opens. Your trust will need to profile and effectively manage spend of the PDG funding. The rate of funding is set out in this <a class="govuk-link" href="#table">table</a>. You will be issued with a grant agreement setting out the terms under which the PDG will be paid. You must read these terms before signing the agreement and returning it to DfE. Your trust will need its own bank account into which the funds can be paid. You cannot use a personal or other similar bank account. If your school is part of a trust with more than one school, the trust account may be used.</p>

<p>The PDG will be formed of 2 elements. You will be given an initial allocation of £30,000 and the balance of the PDG funds will be paid in instalments after the provisional opening date has been agreed. This initial £30,000 should be sufficient to meet all the pre-opening costs likely to be incurred by your trust up until the site solution is confirmed and DfE have agreed a provisional opening date with you in writing. The remainder will be allocated at this point, with the schedule of payments modelled around the budget profile you provide for the remainder of time in pre-opening. The exception to this is for projects where heads of terms for site and provisional opening date have been agreed at the point which the project enters pre-opening, in these cases, the initial £30,000 allocation will not be provided separately and will instead be included in the overall PDG payment schedule.</p>

<p>You must provide regular budget profiles and statements of expenditure throughout the pre-opening phase. Your delivery officer will advise when it will be necessary to provide these returns, but, as a minimum, you are required to provide a budget profile and statement of expenditure at least once a year. Details of future returns and templates are provided as part of the grant agreement.</p>

<p>Future payments will be delayed or stopped at any time if the terms of the grant are not upheld (for example, by not making timely expenditure returns, through inappropriate use of public funds, or if your project does not make satisfactory progress). You must escalate to your delivery officer if you forecast to overspend on the PDG.</p>

<p>If your project is cancelled before the school opens, you must not incur any further expenditure and must return any unused PDG funding, in accordance with the conditions of grant set out in the grant agreement.</p>

<p>If you have any PDG funding left over when the school opens, you should roll this over into the school’s budget. Unspent PDG cannot be held by the trust. The level of PDG has been set based on previous free schools’ costs in the pre-opening phase. DfE would not anticipate that schools will roll substantial amounts into their school’s budget beyond any unspent contingency, which is likely to be small. DfE do not expect schools to assume that they will carry forward any funding into their funding plans for the open school</p>

<p>After opening, free schools can reclaim VAT on expenditure incurred during the pre-opening phase from HMRC. More information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageLibrary_ShowContent&amp;propertyType=document&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_031401" rel="external">HMRC website</a> You should seek advice from your local tax office on reclaiming VAT once open, DfE and your delivery officer are not able to advise on tax policy. The school can also retain any VAT it recoups from HMRC on PDG expenditure. Note that the terms of other grants may differ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Project development grant rates</h3>

<p>The amount of PDG you receive will vary depending on the type of school you are opening (for example, secondary, primary, AP).</p>

<p>If your trust is opening a single school in an academic year you will receive the full PDG rate for the type of school you are opening. Once you have been approved to open more than one school in a given academic year, you are expected to realise efficiencies in areas such as project management, educational services, administration and office costs. You will therefore receive full PDG funding for the first school and a reduced amount of PDG funding for each additional school.</p>

<p>Where you are opening multiple schools, the amount of PDG will be determined by the provisional opening date of the school agreed with DfE. This is regardless of when the project was approved to pre-opening. The current rates which are payable to projects in the pre-opening phase are set out in the table below.</p>

</table>

<p>The numbers of schools that a trust is opening in a single academic year will include any schools approved to pre-opening.</p>

<p>In cases where the provisional opening date is deferred, additional funding will not normally be allocated to the project. The project will retain the PDG rate that it is already receiving (although the payment profile may be amended to reflect the longer pre-opening period). Trusts will need to re-profile their budget expenditure plans and resubmit them to DfE.</p>

<h4>Planning your project development grant budget</h4>

<p>You must ensure that all spending is essential to the development of the school during the pre-opening phase and provides good value for money. DfE does not expect to provide any other funding to meet pre-opening costs. You should therefore think very carefully about how to allocate your budget before committing to any expenditure.</p>

<p>The PDG is intended to cover all revenue costs up to the opening of the school. It is not intended for the purchase of resources that the school will need once open such as books and curriculum materials. Capital costs to secure and develop the school’s site and ICT to support the curriculum are provided by FSC and should not be funded from the PDG.</p>

<p>Typically, projects will use their PDG funding to pay for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>project management (support to coordinate all work leading to the development of the school, excluding site related issues)</li>
  <li>educational services</li>
  <li>staff recruitment (including the principal designate)</li>
  <li>salary costs (which often include the principal designate, finance or business manager and administrative support in advance of opening)</li>
  <li>marketing costs</li>
  <li>consultation costs and open evening costs</li>
  <li>pre-opening office costs</li>
  <li>administration of admissions (including applications and appeals)</li>
  <li>trustee induction and support</li>
</ul>

<p>Many projects also use their PDG to purchase the financial and management information system that the school requires in advance of opening. Where possible, it is good practice to maintain a contingency in your initial financial plan to cover unexpected costs. As set out above, if any grant funding is left when the school opens it should be rolled into the school’s budget.</p>

<p>It is up to you to decide how you allocate your PDG spending. Requirements vary from project to project depending on the local context, the school and the wider resources available to the trust. The New Schools Network provides a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/pre-open-schools/resources" rel="external">budget planning tool</a>, which you can use to plan your spending during pre-opening. This includes examples of how different types of proposers have used this funding in the past.</p>

<p>The funding you receive is public money and you will need to be able to demonstrate that the way you use it meets the highest standards of propriety and secures good value for money. The principles of good governance described below should apply throughout the project to open the school.</p>

<p>One person within the trust should have overall responsibility for managing the financial plan and PDG expenditure. They should be accountable to the trust and DfE for ensuring that funding is used properly and that the budget is managed well.</p>

<p>You will receive the PDG grant letter shortly after the project enters the pre-opening phase. Your delivery officer will monitor the progress of the project and check expenditure returns are received and appropriate. They will challenge projects, where necessary, on their use of PDG funding, and can arrange for payments to be delayed or stopped where necessary. Requests may also be made by your delivery officer to see evidence of the spend, for example, invoices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Governance and accounting arrangements</h3>

<p>Before opening, your trust will need to put in place effective systems for managing the public funding that it receives. Putting good governance arrangements in place at this stage will help develop a strong framework for the school on opening.</p>

<p>You will need to ensure that the trust’s spending choices and decisions are in the school’s best interests and are transparent and defensible. Your trust will need to be able to demonstrate sound financial procedures, the capacity to handle public money, and good governance arrangements. You must consider the potential for conflicts of interest and have an agreed policy in place setting out how you will deal with them. Your delivery officer will consider the progress made towards developing effective financial governance arrangements for the open school. You must escalate to your delivery officer if you have identified any potential conflicts of interest when spending your PDG.</p>

<p>You will need to agree how you will manage payments and any related decisions, such as how you will award contracts. You will also need to retain original copies of all receipts, invoices, contracts and tender documents, which DfE may review at any time.</p>

<p>Your trust will need to have a robust framework to manage its funding and ensure proper accountability and procedures are maintained. At the pre-opening phase, important tasks to deliver this include:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Setting out the role of the Chief Finance Officer (for example, a finance director or business manager) and recruiting an appropriate person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forming the finance committee of the governing body, agreeing its terms of reference and making sure that the committee’s membership includes appropriate financial expertise and a process for checking its financial systems, controls, transactions and risks. This programme of risk review and checking of financial controls can be managed in the way that the trust deems most appropriate to their circumstances. Further information on internal scrutiny can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ratifying the appointment of the accounting officer (normally the principal for a trust with only one school and the SEL for a trust with more than one school).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Securing formal governing body approval for the first year’s budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing policies and manuals covering procurement (including competitive tendering), delegation of responsibilities, financial procedures, internal control (including a split between purchasing, authorising and payment roles) and management of conflicts of interests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#governance-1">governance</a> section of this guide gives further advice on some of these tasks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>School resource management</h3>

<p>Effective schools make the best use of resources, ensuring that every pound is used to have maximum impact for their pupils and the school. Schools that do this well tend to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>plan their curriculum and finances in a combined exercise, known as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/integrated-curriculum-and-financial-planning-icfp">integrated curriculum and financial planning (ICFP)</a> which allows them to base their financial planning on delivering educational outcomes, rather than as a separate consideration - ICFP can help analyse the most effective deployment of staff, for example, it can help model the impact of flexible working arrangements on your budget to make the best decision for your curriculum and finances while being inclusive of staff needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>have a strategic approach towards financial planning for the longer term (3 to 5 years)</li>
  <li>deploy their staff effectively and efficiently, linked to their long-term plan</li>
  <li>have robust challenge from financially skilled governors and headteachers</li>
  <li>have skilled staff responsible for managing finances, who have experience of seeking best value for money when procuring</li>
  <li>have transparent financial systems and processes that encourage constructive challenge within and between schools</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-excellent-school-resource-management/supporting-excellent-school-resource-management">School resource management collection</a> offers a variety of resources and guidance for schools and academies to help them reduce costs so that they can invest their resources into areas that make the most difference to pupil outcomes.</p>

<p>It includes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-dfe-approved-framework-for-your-school">approved frameworks</a> which can help schools save money on regular purchases such as:</p>

<p>To receive regular updates about the school resource management tools, support and guidance, schools can sign up to DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/join-or-create-a-network-for-school-business-professionals/school-business-professional-networks-directory">schools business professionals contact list</a></p>

<h4>The academies financial handbook</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a>, together with the funding agreement, sets out the financial management and governance requirements for academy trusts.</p>

<p>You must comply with the handbook throughout the pre-opening phase and once open. This is outlined within the grant agreements underlying any funding you receive from DfE or ESFA. Non-compliance with the handbook is considered a breach of contract and may trigger various sanctions.</p>

<p>The handbook is aimed at trustees, accounting officers (principals, chief executives and SELs), chief financial officers (finance directors, business managers or equivalent), clerks and governance professionals to the board of trustees, local governing bodies of trusts and auditors.</p>

<p>The handbook clearly articulates that the accounting officer is personally responsible to Parliament and to the accounting officer of ESFA for the resources under their control. This personal responsibility extends to ensuring regularity, propriety and value for money. The accounting officer also has responsibilities for keeping proper financial records and accounts, and for the management of opportunities and risks.</p>

<h4>Financial statements</h4>

<p>Free schools with a funding agreement with the Secretary of State and an open academy at any point during the accounting period must submit audited annual report and financial statements to ESFA, for each year ending 31 August, by 31 December. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-accounts-direction">academies accounts direction</a> prescribes the form and content of the financial statements. Prior to signing the funding agreement financial statements should be prepared in accordance with company law.</p>

<p>Trusts should set their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-your-company-accounting-reference-date-aa01">accounting reference date</a> to 31 August at Companies House. This is the date to which their financial statements will be produced.</p>

<p>The accounts must also be filed by 31 May (within 9 months of the end of the accounting period) with Companies House. Further information can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house">Companies House</a>.</p>

<h4>Other financial returns</h4>

<p>Trusts must also submit the following financial returns to ESFA once open:</p>

<ul>
  <li>budget forecast return outturn in May and the budget forecast return 3-year in July</li>
  <li>audited financial statements for the year ending 31 August by the following December</li>
  <li>academies accounts return for the year ending 31 August by the following January</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-financial-management-and-governance-self-assessment-guidance">financial management and governance self-assessment</a> submitted to ESFA within 3 months of opening. The self-assessment highlights the main requirements academies must have in place soon after opening</li>
</ul>

<p>Trusts are responsible for keeping up-to-date with the latest deadlines and requirements. More information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/academies-financial-returns">academies financial returns</a>.</p>

<p>You can also keep up-to-date through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/skills-funding-agency-update">ESFA update</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span>Insurance cover: risk protection arrangement (RPA)</h3>

<p>Risk protection arrangement (RPA) is an alternative to commercial insurance, whereby the government covers any losses that arise. The RPA will cover losses that are in scope of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa">RPA membership rules</a>.</p>

<p>The RPA membership year runs from 1 September to the following 31 August, however members can join at any time. Please note, free schools can join the RPA scheme and receive cover prior to opening; there is no cost or premium to join the RPA in pre-opening. In the pre-opening stage, you should have discussions with your delivery officer regarding RPA and inform them if you wish to opt into the RPA scheme at an early stage.</p>

<p>Once a school is open, ESFA funding will deduct the per-pupil cost at source from your free school’s general annual grant (GAG). Until 31 August 2021, the cost of RPA is £18 per pupil per place per year; from 1 September 2021 it increases to £19 per pupil per place per year.</p>

<p>Free schools do not have to enter the scheme and are free to make their own alternative insurance arrangements: however, there will be no additional funding provided should extra costs be incurred. More information on RPA can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa">risk protection arrangement</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.10 </span>Funding for open schools</h3>

<p>DfE will assess your school’s financial plan before entering into a funding agreement, and in advance of issuing your indicative funding letter, which will set out the level of funding you should expect upon opening. DfE will not enter into a funding agreement if it is not confident that the school has a viable financial plan.</p>

<p>You must escalate to your delivery officer if you are unable to submit a viable financial plan.</p>

<p>Developing your school’s financial plan should be an ongoing process, which should be considered jointly with the development of your curriculum. Plans should be updated as further details of funding arrangements become available, staff are appointed, site plans are firmed-up, the projected number of pupils become clearer and other costs are more confidently established.</p>

<p>Further updates should take account of the number of staff required to cater for these pupils. This may change over time and updates should ensure staffing structures are affordable and appropriate.</p>

<p>The assumptions boxes on the plan should be used to set out the basis for any estimates of pupil numbers and pupil characteristics, income from sources other than ESFA, and expenditure (including service contracts and salaries).</p>

<p>Guides to free school revenue funding are available on the gov.uk website, for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mainstream-free-school-revenue-funding">mainstream</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-free-school-revenue-funding">16 to 19</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/special-free-school-revenue-funding">special</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-provision-free-school-revenue-funding">alternative provision</a> free schools. These explain how funding for new free schools opening in 2021 to 2022 is calculated and also contains details of how the post-opening grant, which is provided to new schools as they build up to full capacity, will be calculated.</p>

<p>The free school financial templates are updated in spring each year to reflect the changes in national and local funding rates. The latest version of the templates can be found on GOV.UK. The rates in the template you used when you made your application may not be the ones for the year in which you will open. You will need to ensure that you refresh your financial plan in the spring before opening when the new rates are available. Your delivery officer will keep you updated on any changes.</p>

<p>The approval of your application to the pre-opening phase is therefore conditional on you submitting revised financial plans at important points during pre-opening so that DfE can be assured that your school is on-course to be financially viable. In particular, you may be asked to share your current financial plans with DfE before entering into a funding agreement, which should also include a version modelled around the lowest viable number of pupils for your first year of opening. This information will be used to prepare draft funding allocation packs for issue.</p>

<p>Your delivery officer may ask you to revise your plans or give further information if needed to show that the school will be viable and efficient in using resources to deliver pupil outcomes, both during your early years of operation, when pupil numbers are building up and when your school is operating with all year groups. They will need to see that the school has developed robust and consistent curriculum, staffing and financial plans, and strong financial governance arrangements. Plans should demonstrate clearly how the school will minimise non-staff costs and that the school will be efficient, viable and not go into deficit in any year.</p>

<h4>Mainstream schools: developing a viable financial plan</h4>

<p>Once the school is open, it will be funded by the ESFA. Funding will be paid monthly in equal instalments. With the exception of the school’s first month of opening, when the school will be paid on the sixth working day of the month, the ESFA pays schools their funding on the first working day of the month. The funding for free schools is set at an equivalent level to funding for all other state-funded schools. Funding is largely based on a payment for each pupil who attends the school, but the detailed funding methodology may vary over time with changes to the funding of the school system as a whole.</p>

<p>The government will ensure that any new free schools that are not yet open but are in the pipeline, or will enter the pipeline during 2021 to 2022, are funded consistently with other schools.</p>

<p>In 2021 to 2022 local authorities will remain responsible for setting individual schools’ budgets through a local funding formula. Free schools are encouraged to speak with their local authority about their plans for implementation of the NFF. Funding for schools in 2022 to 2023 will be announced in the summer and funding in future years is subject to the next spending review.</p>

<p>Financial (and, therefore, educational) viability is dependent upon you admitting a sufficient number of pupils. In order to provide a sustainable, broad and balanced curriculum, there is a presumption that primary provision should have a minimum of 2 forms of entry of 30 pupils, and secondary provision have a minimum of 4 forms of entry of 30 pupils. DfE do not expect financial plans to be based on fewer pupil numbers. If you expect this to be the case, then please contact your delivery officer to discuss the rationale.</p>

<p>Once open, if the October schools census shows the school has not admitted the predicted number of pupils, any excess funding will be clawed back in the following academic year. Where more pupils are recruited than have been funded for, ESFA will carry out an in-year reconciliation and pay any additional funding in the current academic year.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the guide to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mainstream-free-school-revenue-funding">mainstream free school revenue funding</a>.</p>

<h4>16 to 19 free schools: developing a viable financial plan</h4>

<p>Once the school is open, it will be funded by ESFA. Funding will be paid monthly in equal instalments. With the exception of the school’s first month of opening, when the school will be paid on the sixth working day of the month, the ESFA pays schools their funding on the first working day of the month. 16 to 19 free schools are funded on the basis of the post-16 national funding formula.</p>

<p>Funding is largely based on a payment for each student who attends the school, but the detailed funding methodology may vary over time with changes to the funding of 16 to 19 provision as a whole. Financial, and therefore educational, viability is dependent upon you admitting a sufficient number of students.</p>

<p>Securing financial viability can be particularly challenging for 16 to 19 institutions. If you are proposing a 16 to 19 school with a broad curriculum of A levels (or A levels and vocational qualifications), you will need to consider whether this would be achieved by being the following size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a larger school of at least 1,000 students</li>
  <li>a smaller school within a trust with more than one school, so that nearby schools in the trust can share expertise, teaching staff or other resources, such as back office services, to produce economies of scale, or where existing local 11 to 16 schools in the trust could be ‘feeder’ schools for the 16 to 19 school – a school in a trust where only back office services are shared might need to have up to 900 students, whereas one where there was also extensive sharing of teaching staff and facilities with neighbouring schools in the trust might be viable at a smaller size</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are proposing a smaller specialist school with a narrow or niche curriculum, you will be best placed to achieve this where you have significant support from a partner organisation that will help to attract students. DfE would expect a suitable partner organisation to be well-established, stable and known as a leader in its field. The partner organisation will need to commit to close involvement with the school, such as through financial support or by providing teaching for courses in the specialist area or additional opportunities for students, such as high-quality work experience or access to teaching in a different institution.</p>

<p>If you are proposing to include a sixth form within a secondary school, you should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>size - an expectation of around 200 students or more, either in the institution or through partnership</li>
  <li>breadth - an expectation that a student should be able to choose from around 15 A levels across a range of subjects, either in the institution or through partnership</li>
  <li>demand - including any shortage of post-16 places, and assessment of the quality of level 3 provision overall in the area and the impact of the new provision on other providers</li>
  <li>financial viability and value for money - including testing financial resilience should student numbers fall and considering the degree and impact on 11 to 16 education of cross-subsidisation of funding from the school’s other budgets</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be eligible for a programme weighting funding uplift if you offer a curriculum that is particularly expensive to deliver, such as engineering. You may also be eligible for funding uplift if you anticipate higher disadvantage levels than the local authority average. If these criteria apply, you will be asked to provide a business case to establish any additional funding you might attract in order to reflect the extra costs associated with technical programmes of study or high levels of disadvantage.</p>

<p>Note that as students are able to hold multiple offers, an adjustment of at least minus 30% must be applied to financial plans to take account of a potential drop-out between accepted offers and start date.</p>

<p>Once open, if the October schools census shows the school has not admitted the predicted number of pupils, any excess funding will be clawed back in the following academic year. Where more pupils are recruited than have been funded for, ESFA will carry out an in-year reconciliation and pay any additional funding in the current academic year.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-free-school-revenue-funding">guide to 16 to 19 free school revenue funding</a>.</p>

<h4>Special free schools: developing a viable financial plan</h4>

<p>Once the school is open, funding will be calculated and paid in the school’s first year by both ESFA and local authorities commissioning places at the school.</p>

<p>Funding will be paid monthly in equal instalments. With the exception of the school’s first month of opening, when the school will be paid on the sixth working day of the month, the ESFA pays schools their funding on the first working day of the month.</p>

<p>As of 2019, funding for special free schools is included in local authorities’ high needs allocations. The number of places to be funded at special free schools from their second year of opening onwards will be agreed with the local authority through the place change notification process.</p>

<p>Funding in special free schools comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funding from ESFA for full-time equivalent places. The flat rate per-place funding will be paid for a number of places, which will be subject to regular review by the local authority in whose area the school is located, and dependent on local authorities’ commissioning of the places for those pupils with education, health and care (EHC) plans</li>
  <li>per-pupil top-up funding paid by the local authority (the top-up funding comes from the local authority commissioning the place and is determined by the local authority in negotiation with the free school based on the pupil’s assessed needs and the cost of meeting those needs in the school) - this top-up funding is paid for as long as the pupil attends the school and will flow directly between the local authority and the special free school</li>
  <li>pupils without EHC plans can only be admitted to special schools in certain circumstances - you should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">SEND code of practice</a> and your funding agreement for further details</li>
</ul>

<p>Special free schools, like other special schools, can also receive funding from local authorities and other schools for commissioned services, for example, to provide specialist teaching support for pupils in local mainstream schools.</p>

<p>In all cases, the income that special free schools receive and their future viability will depend on providing the places needed locally and on local authorities’ willingness to place pupils with EHC plans at the school and pay for the costs of the special provision on offer. Local authorities often have standard rates of top-up funding for pupils with different levels of need, which they use for maintained special schools and special academies. DfE have encouraged local authorities to publish information about their top-up funding arrangements. Special free schools should expect to operate on similar levels of funding from local authorities.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/special-free-school-revenue-funding">guide to special free school revenue funding</a>.</p>

<h4>Alternative provision free schools: developing a viable financial plan</h4>

<p>Once the school is open, funding will be calculated and paid by both ESFA and those commissioning places at the school. Funding will be paid monthly in equal instalments. With the exception of the school’s first month of opening, when the school will be paid on the sixth working day of the month, the ESFA pays schools their funding on the first working day of the month.</p>

<p>Alternative provision (AP) free schools are established in response to demand by local authorities or local schools. Evidence of this demand is needed to support the establishment of the school. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that adequate AP is available for pupils in their area who are not at a mainstream or special school. The detailed funding methodology may vary over time as changes are made to the school and high-needs funding systems.</p>

<p>From the third academic year after an AP free school opening, ESFA starts to deduct an appropriate proportion of the place funding from the high needs funding block within the dedicated schools grant (DSG) of the local authority where the pupil resides. This is because some AP free schools accept pupils from local authorities other than the one in whose area they are located, or from schools and academies in other local authority areas.</p>

<p>Funding in AP free schools comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funding from ESFA for each full-time equivalent place for pre-16 pupils. Like all funding, this will be subject to regular review</li>
  <li>per-pupil top-up funding paid by the commissioner (local authority or other school. Top-up funding is agreed between the provider and commissioner and paid to the provider directly by the commissioner for each individual pupil. Top-up funding is to meet any costs in excess of the base funding threshold)</li>
  <li>per student funding from ESFA for students aged 16 to 18</li>
  <li>any other funding received for commissioned services (such as outreach work in local schools) from the local authority or school commissioning the service</li>
</ul>

<p>AP free schools’ continuing financial viability depends on both the ongoing support of local authorities and schools or academies, in terms of a commitment to commission placements and services, and their willingness to provide associated funding. It is therefore important that you are able to show evidence before you open that your commissioning authorities and schools have committed to commissioning places at your school. Schools’ commitment to commissioning places at your school should be accompanied by a recognition of the costs of the AP and the value for money the school will offer, an understanding of how those costs will be met by local authorities and schools in the area, and an assessment of the affordability of the provision based on these factors.</p>

<p>More information can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-provision-free-school-revenue-funding">AP free school revenue funding</a>.</p>

<h4>High needs funding overview</h4>

<p>High needs funding is allocated from the local authority’s dedicated schools grant (DSG) high needs block to provide support for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and to meet their statutory needs. Mainstream pre-16 free schools are expected to meet the first £6,000 per annum of additional costs that may arise for supporting a SEND child from its own delegated budget A special free school with a unit or resourced provision would fund SEND children in the same way for those occupied by pupils on roll and £10,000 per place for the reminder of special school places; and an alternative provision (AP) free school would receive high needs funding for pre-16 school places at £10,000, based on a FTE equivalent pupil roll number.</p>

<p>The support could be provided through a statutory assessment or via an education, health and care (EHC) plan, but local authorities also have discretion to provide top-up funding to those children without an EHC plan up to the age of 19. Local authorities will provide top-up funding to individual children in mainstream, special or AP free schools when the support costs exceed more than £10,000. Local authorities bear the ultimate responsibility for decisions on top-up funding, as they are accountable for spending from their high needs budgets. However, DfE expect the level of support and rates to be discussed and agreed in writing with individual schools.</p>

<p>More information on high needs funding can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2021-to-2022">High needs funding operational guide 2021 to 2022</a>.</p>

<h4>Funding for free school nurseries</h4>

<p>If your free school includes a nursery, it will be funded on the same basis as other early years provision not using the same formula as any other free school. This is because the Secretary of State does not enter into a funding agreement in respect of the nursery, as it is instead funded by the local authority or parents paying for places. Our expectation is that the school and the nursery should each be financially viable without reliance on cross-subsidy.</p>

<p>All 3 and 4-year-olds, and some 2-year-olds whose parents receive certain benefits, are entitled to 570 hours of funded early education each year. Since September 2017, 3 and 4-year-olds have been eligible for an additional 570 funded hours per year where both parents are employed and earn above the minimum or living wage for 16 hours per week but neither has a taxable income over £100,000. Further information regarding the criteria for funded childcare can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-childcare">get childcare</a>. A nursery cannot put conditions on the free hours (for example, only allowing parents to access their free entitlement if they agree to taking additional paid hours or pay for lunches).</p>

<p>Where parents choose to take their free entitlement in a nursery that is part of a free school, the local authority will fund that provision from their DSG allocation at an hourly rate agreed by the local schools forum. The local authority is only required to fund the children who attend the nursery; they are not required to fund empty places.</p>

<p>During 2021 and 2022, this formula includes a minimum hourly funding rate of £4.44 for the 3- and 4-year-old entitlements and a requirement for local authorities to pass 95% of funding directly to providers. The EYNFF also established a Disability Access Fund, which pays £615 per year for each eligible child, to enable them to access the free entitlement, and it also places a requirement on local authorities to establish a special educational needs inclusion fund (SENIF), to support children with SEN to achieve good outcomes in the early years. Further information on the EYNFF can be accessed at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-funding-2021-2022">early years funding 2021 to 2022</a>.</p>

<p>To receive funding for the free early years entitlements, your free school nursery must be registered on the Early Years Register, or be a school that is exempt from such registration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#inspections-and-registration-as-an-independent-school">section 15</a> for further details). When these criteria are met, the local authority must ensure that free childcare is made available at the early years provider (including nurseries) of the parent’s choice, provided that the nursery is willing to provide the funded places, accept any terms of payment, and accept any requirements that would be imposed by the local authority (for instance, requirements in respect of SEN, safeguarding and maintaining Ofsted quality standards).</p>

<p>A free school nursery may charge parents for additional hours above the free entitlement and is free to decide its own rate for this additional provision, but it cannot charge for the free hours that are funded by the government. Free school nurseries are allowed to make a profit, but the accounting must be separate from the school’s General Annual Grant and the provision must be set up as one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>direct provision by the free school – any surplus can be reinvested into the school</li>
  <li>a not-for-profit charitable company – the company can retain any trading surplus as a reserve, or reinvest this into the school</li>
  <li>a for-profit company – the profits can be reinvested into the school once the company has accumulated a prudent reserve</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Procurement and additional support</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Purchasing goods and services</h3>

<p>Academy trusts are classed as public bodies and must comply with public procurement regulations. It is important that you understand the requirements when you are planning any purchase. Essentially, the rules are about using a fair and open procurement process to help ensure that you achieve the best outcomes for your free school and the best value for money.</p>

<p>Schools need to buy a wide range of goods and services and they may use different suppliers, such as public sector buying organisations, procurement consultancies and local authority traded services to help them do so. This diversity can offer opportunities for schools to improve their efficiency but navigating the system can be complex. Detailed guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-for-schools">buying for schools</a> is available. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/977738/Schools_Buying_Prospectus_April_2021.pdf" rel="external">Schools buying programme 2020:prospectus 2020-2025</a> outlines the support available to help schools improve value for money from their non-staff spend.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Summary of the main tasks</h3>

<p>You will need to make sure that you understand the rules and regulations on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-procedures-and-procurement-law-for-schools">buying procedures and procurement laws</a> governing public spending and decide early on how you will make any spending decisions. As a general guide, the higher the value of the purchase and the more public money you are spending, the greater rigour and scrutiny you should have to the procurement rules.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to set out the trust’s approach to procurement within your financial management policy. This means thinking about how you will approve and review your expenditure and how any financial powers will be delegated, so that it is clear who is responsible for what.</p>

<p>You will need to be clear about how best to use your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#pdg">project development grant</a>. You should review your group’s capacity and capability to decide what you can deliver for no cost and to estimate the total value of what you need to buy. Remember that value for money is not always about the lowest price but involves getting the right balance between quality and cost. Think about how you will measure both of these when you specify and evaluate your purchase. You are spending public money and need to be able to demonstrate that you are using it well. It is always useful to ask yourself if your procurement decisions can be satisfactorily defended in public. There is more detail on typical areas of project expenditure in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#funding-and-finance">section 6</a>.</p>

<p>Having a good range of expertise in your group can help you to decide what you can do for yourselves at no cost and when you will need to buy in support because your capacity or capability is likely to be stretched. It will also help you to negotiate and push back on costs to get a better deal.</p>

<p>Good procurement decisions will help you get the right support and achieve value for money. Conversely, if you do not follow a fair and transparent process and apply criteria consistently, you are less likely to identify the best proposals from potential suppliers. Poor procurement decisions risk wasting time and money and slowing down progress. They also risk reputational damage if potential suppliers think you are not being fair and if people think you are not using public money properly. If you have not followed the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-sector-procurement-policy">public procurement policy</a> you could be open to legal challenges from suppliers. If challenges are successful, this can lead to contracts being cancelled, competitions having to be re-held and financial penalties incurred (compensation).</p>

<p>Guidance is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-for-schools">buying for schools</a> to help you plan and implement the most appropriate process for your school procurement need.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Site and buildings</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>This section explains how free schools capital (FSC) will work with you to find and secure a suitable site for your school. More detailed guidance on how this fits into a programme for delivering the site and buildings for your school, and the other stages in that process, is included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/FSC%20Customer%20Booklet%20180221v4.pdf" rel="external">customer journey: building your school booklet</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Important messages</h3>

<p>Finding the right site for your free school is very important. It can also be the most time-consuming, complex and frustrating aspect of your project. However, it is important not to get distracted by the site at the expense of the important tasks during pre-opening. Clarity of roles within your proposer group is crucial in relation to this. It is recommended that there is a person who leads on the site and works with FSC to prevent people from worrying about the site unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The earlier a site is secured, relevant planning permission obtained and building works agreed, the better. Having these in place can be very useful when marketing your school to prospective parents, pupils and staff.</p>

<p>The length of time to a secure a permanent site will vary for each free school project. Important factors for finding a site are your school’s operational requirements and the location. Some areas have better site availability than others. It is difficult to find suitable sites in some areas of the country and for this reason, you may need to be flexible about where the school is located (as well as about the year of opening). FSC will only look at temporary accommodation in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>The average time taken to secure a suitable site is around a year, while the normal lead time for acquiring and delivering sites ready for a school to open is around 3 years. Therefore, unless a site is already secured and requires little work and no planning approval, opening in a shorter period will be extremely challenging. Whilst it is important to secure a site that is appropriate for the school, DfE must also achieve value for money for the public purse.</p>

<p>You should not announce the site that has been chosen for your school until your project director has confirmed the site has been secured and that it is appropriate to do so. This is because commercial negotiations are highly sensitive and can be undermined by premature public announcements about acquisitions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Finding a site</h3>

<p>Free schools can be located in a wide variety of premises. They may not look like ‘traditional’ school buildings and will often not require the construction of a completely new building. Free schools have historically been delivered in refurbished or remodelled accommodation, as well as new build facilities. DfE has adopted a presumption in favour of offsite construction (see below) where it represents value for money following the Chancellor of the Exchequer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-2017-documents/autumn-budget-2017#productivity">budget announcement</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>Sites should be selected based on suitability for offsite construction. There are a range of terms which have been used for offsite construction: it is the manufacture and pre-assembly of construction components, elements or sub-assemblies which are then brought to the site. There are a number of factors to be taken into consideration when establishing if a project is suitable for offsite construction, such as any road access or height restrictions preventing the pre-assembled components being brought to site; or there is a high proportion of refurbishment work. Further details of the process are available in the DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offsite-construction-framework-modern-methods-of-construction/modern-methods-of-construction-mmc1">Modern Methods of Construction Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>After the approval of your proposal, FSC will join your project kick-off meeting with your delivery officer to discuss the suitability of the proposed premises and to consider any alternative site solutions. Before this meeting, FSC will have reviewed the suitability and availability of any sites you have proposed in your application and identified the necessary next steps. Depending on the outcome of the review, FSC may also have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commissioned LocatED, to undertake a site search, and considered alternative sites where relevant</li>
  <li>contacted the relevant local authority about planning designation</li>
  <li>considered the availability of government buildings</li>
</ul>

<p>FSC realise you may already have a preference for a particular site. Please be aware, however, that it may not be the most feasible one. Common reasons why that might be the case includes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is too small or too big for the number of pupils</li>
  <li>it is not actually on the market, or available in the time needed</li>
  <li>it is too expensive to buy, lease or maintain</li>
  <li>it requires too much work to be affordable</li>
  <li>it does not have, and FSC may not be able to get, the appropriate planning permission for a school</li>
  <li>it is a listed structure (securing planning for change of use and works is expensive, complicated and time consuming, which may increase the risk of delays – the ongoing maintenance of a listed structure and restrictions of use is likely to be expensive and restrictive for the trust)</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep an open mind regarding sites. Just because a site doesn’t look like a school, it doesn’t mean it cannot become one.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>FSC and LocatED responsibilities in finding a site</h3>

<p>During the site search stage of the project, FSC will commission LocatED where appropriate to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conduct site searches and provide you with a suitable site</li>
  <li>FSC or LocatED’s technical advisers to visit and assess the preferred site, provide a high-level view of the nature and cost of any construction works needed, planning consents required and likely running costs</li>
  <li>if that assessment shows the site is affordable and good value for money, FSC or LocatED will start negotiations to acquire the site</li>
</ul>

<p>If a market site is to be acquired, it will be LocatED’s decision to secure sites based on a commission from FSC following close engagement with the trust on their requirements. Trusts will be given an opportunity at the start of the process to input into the commissioning instruction. It is important that you take this opportunity to feed in your views, as the commissioning instruction will form the basis for decisions on securing a site. LocatED will be required to obtain confirmation from the project director that the original commissioning instruction has been met prior to LocatED finalising their decision to acquire a site and the project director will keep the trust involved throughout and inform you of the site selected.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span>How the trust can help</h3>

<p>If you have any information or local knowledge that you would like FSC property managers or LocatED to be aware of as part of the site search, you should feed this in through your project director. FSC welcome any information that trusts may have – but you must not enter into negotiations on sites, as doing so would undermine the negotiating position of the experts who are commissioned to do that. More importantly, this is public money and any funds committed to a project must be done with ministerial approval.</p>

<p>You must not announce the site that has been chosen for your school until your project director has confirmed that it has been secured and that it is appropriate to do so. This is because commercial negotiations are highly sensitive and there is a risk that they will be undermined by premature public announcements about acquisitions.</p>

<p>You will also need to take heed of FSC advice about local developments and how they affect your site options, for example, new build development and their contribution to basic need or s106 site provision.</p>

<p>In collaboration with NSN, FSC have developed a number of resources that provide an overview of the people and processes involved in securing a site. These can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/pre-open-schools/resources" rel="external">New Schools Network</a>.</p>

<p>You should work with your project director throughout the process, to ensure that the site is suited to the needs of your proposed school. However, you may need to be flexible, as it is not always possible to deliver a site and buildings that match your preferred specification exactly, due to constraints such as cost, size and time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span>Securing a site</h3>

<p>Securing a site can be complex and time-consuming. However, once FSC have found a suitable site for your school that can be delivered in the timescales available and that represents value for money, the FSC property team or LocatED will begin negotiations to acquire it. The six main ways of doing that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>peppercorn rent lease (delivered by FSC property and legal teams).A peppercorn lease is usually agreed at a nominal rent i.e. £1 per year and is therefore considered a ‘free site’</li>
  <li>S106 site (delivered by FSC property and legal teams) A s106 is a legal agreement between a local authority and a developer that commits a developer to providing land and/or financial support in the delivery of a school, this could range from making a financial contribution to providing the land on a peppercorn lease to proving the land and paying in part or fully to build the school. What a developer agrees to in the s106 will depend on the size and viability of the site.</li>
  <li>peppercorn lease (academy trust held lands – delivered by FSC property and legal teams)</li>
  <li>peppercorn lease pursuant to development (delivered by FSC)</li>
  <li>freehold purchase (delivered by LocatED on behalf of FSC)</li>
  <li>commercial lease (delivered by LocatED on behalf of FSC)</li>
</ul>

<p>As with buying a new home, there will be sensitive negotiations around acquiring a site for your school. Site owners want to secure the best possible deal for themselves while it is FSC’s duty to secure best value for you and the taxpayer.</p>

<p>It is vital that you check with your FSC project manager before discussing or revealing details of the site you are seeking with anyone outside your group. These negotiations are very commercially sensitive and public disclosure can seriously undermine our negotiating position and may result in the transaction being aborted.</p>

<p>Subsequent planning applications can also be affected if information about sites is released at the wrong time. Securing planning approval is of course crucial to delivering your school buildings and at the appropriate time FSC will welcome the support of the trust in establishing a base of support for the proposal with planning officers and elected members at the relevant local planning authority.</p>

<p>Your project manager will tell you when you can publicly confirm your sites (permanent, temporary or both), see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#stat-con">paragraph on statutory consultation</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.7 </span>FSC responsibilities on securing a site</h3>

<p>It is the responsibility of the FSC property manager or LocatED to commence negotiations with the site owner or the agent representing them and seek to agree heads of terms for the purchase or lease of the site.</p>

<p>The FSC property manager, LocatED or the FSC project team will, at the same time, estimate the total costs for the site and seek approval from its investment committee and, where required, ministers, to complete the acquisition.</p>

<p>Lawyers will carry out checks on the tenure, ownership and any restrictions affecting use of the property and complete the transaction. The time this takes will vary from property to property, depending on planning and other issues affecting the property.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.8 </span>Interim site solutions</h3>

<p>In some cases, free schools have opened on a temporary site before being relocated to their permanent buildings, but this should only happen in exceptional circumstances (for instance, because the school is necessary to meet pressing demographic need but the permanent site is not ready). When securing the permanent site, DfE will establish with you whether opening in temporary accommodation is appropriate. DfE will evaluate the risks of this by examining the delivery of the project’s permanent site, evaluating the viability of any proposed temporary solution, testing whether there is clear evidence of need for places in the area and ensuring that value for money is provided when compared to other schools of a similar phase/location. Temporary solutions can come in many forms depending on what is needed and what is available, but the most common are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using a building on the permanent site while other buildings are in construction</li>
  <li>community buildings such as a church hall or community centres</li>
  <li>part of a neighbouring school</li>
  <li>temporary accommodation on the permanent site</li>
  <li>a local office building</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure value for money for the entire project, DfE do not want to spend any more money than necessary on temporary accommodation, so will try to provide an interim solution that requires minimal alteration.</p>

<p>The procurement and costs associated with temporary site works (such as the rental of temporary classrooms) will be managed by FSC, with the Secretary of State entering into required contracts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.9 </span>Difficulties in securing sites</h3>

<p>If a project has spent considerable time in pre-opening without a site being secured, therefore potentially wasting resources, and DfE do not feel it is making sufficient progress despite numerous interventions, we may contact you to inform you that we are considering cancelling the project. During this process, DfE will explain why we are minded to make a particular decision, taking into account the representations of those affected and allow trusts to respond to this before a final decision is made by the minister to cancel the project.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.10 </span>The site and your statutory consultation</h3>

<p>Section 10 of the Academies Act requires proposers of free schools to consult formally with those they think appropriate. This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#statutory">statutory consultation</a> must be completed before the funding agreement can be signed - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#funding-agreement">(see section 14)</a>.</p>

<p>Ideally, you should do this once FSC have secured your permanent site, but in practice that may not always be possible.</p>

<p>If it is not, you could identify a particular catchment area for the free school, such as a postcode, or a particular area of a city or town. At the same time, you do not want to undermine any site negotiations, so FSC will agree with you what information you will need to provide.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.11 </span>The site and your funding agreement</h3>

<p>Other than in exceptional circumstances, DfE will not enter into a funding agreement until heads of terms have been agreed for the permanent site and any temporary site, if relevant. DfE will need to be confident that there is a strong prospect of securing a permanent site and approving the full capital budget for your project.</p>

<p>As part of the funding agreement, there will be a set of land clauses. These aim to protect our public investment in acquiring and developing the land, and to ensure you (the trust) continue to meet your legal obligations as set out in the funding agreement.</p>

<p>Note that the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land clauses in the funding agreement must reflect the relevant model drafted by DfE your delivery officer will confirm the land clauses and on any bespoke legal arrangements that may apply</li>
  <li>legal obligations extend to the responsible stewardship of the site and buildings under standard repair and maintenance requirements in all DfE leases – detailed guidance for trusts on effective building and site management is contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools">good estate management for schools (GEMS)</a>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Pupil recruitment and marketing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>Ensure you have a relentless focus on recruitment and have an effective marketing and recruitment strategy in place.</p>

<p>Focus on frequent face-to-face contact with parents, children or young people. Your group should keep the effectiveness of your plans under constant review by considering the numbers of applications received.</p>

<p>You must market your school to encourage applications from pupils from a range of different ethnic, religious and socioeconomic groups, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to promote a pupil intake that reflects the diversity of your wider local community.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Risks</h3>

<p>It is essential to attract sufficient pupils to ensure your school is viable. Evidence of high levels of demand for your school does not automatically equate to large numbers of applications or referrals. Similarly, do not assume that when you offer places that all those offers will be accepted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Recruitment and marketing</h3>

<p>Successful pupil recruitment is an essential element of the pre-opening period. DfE know there will be many calls on your time, and many other pressing matters, but attracting sufficient pupils to ensure your school is viable is essential. Financial viability, educational planning, and staff recruitment all depend on pupil numbers.</p>

<p>You should not assume that high levels of demand for your school when canvassing for support will automatically equate to large numbers of applications or referrals. Similarly, do not assume that the offers you make will all be accepted. It is essential that you have an unrelenting focus on pupil recruitment.</p>

<p>You may have had very high levels of interest in your free school, but you need to convert this into applications or referrals. During the pre-opening period, your marketing activity should increase and build on the publicity and interest you have already achieved, to show those who have already expressed an interest that the school is moving to the next stage. It will help give them confidence in the school and encourage them to make an application or referral. It will also give you the chance of attracting new parents who may not have paid much attention so far but who would be interested now the school is becoming a reality.</p>

<h4>Mainstream and 16 to 19 projects</h4>

<p>You may find it useful to analyse the types of responses you have had to date and assess where and how best to concentrate your efforts, for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some applicants will have made a firm commitment and you need to keep them engaged, even after you have offered them a place, to ensure they accept</li>
  <li>some potential applicants will have expressed interest without committing to applying and you need to convert that interest into applications</li>
  <li>some people will not have been particularly interested, but as you move into pre-opening, you can confidently begin to engage them as much as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>An adjustment of minus 30% must be applied to financial plans for 16 to 19 projects to take account of a potential drop between applications and accepted offers.</p>

<h4>Faith-designated free school projects, projects registered with a religious ethos or projects with a distinctive educational philosophy or world view</h4>

<p>It is important that your proposed school is likely to attract applications from all parts of the local community, not just those of your faith group. Therefore, you must market the school to a diverse cross-section of the local community, building on the engagement that you demonstrated during the application phase.</p>

<h4>Alternative provision projects</h4>

<p>Having entered the pre-opening phase, your marketing activity should increase, building on the publicity you will have achieved by being approved. This will show commissioners who have already expressed an interest that the school is moving to the next stage. It will also give you the chance of securing new commissioners who may not have paid much attention so far but who would be interested now the school is becoming a reality</p>

<p>You may find it useful to analyse the types of responses you have had to date and assess where and how best to concentrate your efforts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>because some commissioners will have made a firm commitment, and you need to keep them engaged</li>
  <li>because some commissioners will have expressed interest without providing written commitments for places, and you need to convert that interest into actual referrals</li>
  <li>because some commissioners will not have been particularly interested, but as you move into pre-opening, you should build a relationship with them, to engage them as much as possible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Special free school projects</h4>

<p>It is essential to engage with commissioning local authorities to ensure that their need for special provision places matches what the school will offer. Parental preference also plays a part, however, and while local authorities will name your school on EHC plans, it is helpful that you have the buy-in and support of parents and prospective students themselves. Without the support of families, they are unlikely to ask for your school to be named on an EHC plan. It is important, nevertheless, that parents are not offered places for their children and young people that their local authority is unwilling to support or pay for, as this can lead to unhelpful conflict and unnecessary tribunal referrals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span>Recruiting sufficient students</h3>

<p>To provide a broad and balanced curriculum, there is a presumption that primary provision should have a minimum of 2 forms of entry of 30 pupils, and secondary provision a minimum of 4 forms of entry of 30 pupils. DfE do not expect your published admission number (PAN) to be set below this number. If you expect this to be the case, contact your delivery officer to discuss the rationale.</p>

<p>When recruiting, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should regularly update you delivery officer on the number of applications you have received</li>
  <li>must escalate to your delivery officer if the number of applications received by the deadline date, or the accepted offer numbers by national offer day, fall short of the above minimum viable expectations</li>
  <li>should continue with your marketing efforts throughout this period, as historically there can be a drop of around 30% from the number of applications received to the number of students who will accept places</li>
</ul>

<h4>16 to 19 institutions</h4>

<p>Securing financial viability can be particularly challenging. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#funding-and-finance">section 6</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span>Promoting integration and community cohesion</h3>

<p>Promoting integration and community cohesion is a priority for the government. All schools should prepare children and young people to participate fully in life in modern Britain. All state-funded schools should be genuinely welcoming and attractive to pupils from different backgrounds. When marketing your school, you must consider how you can encourage applications from families belonging to different ethnic, religious and socioeconomic groups, to promote a pupil intake that represents the diversity of the wider local community.</p>

<p>To ensure that your marketing plans will support integration and community cohesion, you will first need to consider the demographics of the local community that your school will serve, for example, the main ethnic and faith groups represented within the community, the proportion of pupils who are disadvantaged, and where pupils from different backgrounds live. When considering whether your marketing plans are appropriate, you should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the characteristics of the school that are emphasised in publicity materials, these should not discourage parents from particular socioeconomic, ethnic or religious groups from applying to the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>where marketing events are advertised and held, are prospective applicants from a representative range of backgrounds likely to know that these are taking place, could the location and timing prevent, deter or make it difficult for some groups to attend?</li>
  <li>where publicity materials are distributed or posted online, are they likely to be visible and accessible to prospective applicants from a range of backgrounds that reflects the diversity of the wider local community?</li>
  <li>for secondary schools, whether your marketing activities are targeted at particular primary schools, for example, do the pupil intakes of these schools reflect the diversity of the wider local community?</li>
  <li>whether you have engaged with representatives of the major faith communities represented within the area, to seek their support for the school</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span>Marketing guidance</h3>

<p>There are some general principles and lessons learned by previous proposer groups that should help you get the most out of your planned activity. It is important to maintain momentum, so make sure, for example, that newsletters are issued regularly, emails are answered quickly, online information is up-to-date, and that you publicise important milestones, such as the appointment of a principal designate or securing your site. You may wish to consider the guidance in the following sections.</p>

<h4>Understanding your audience</h4>

<p>When preparing your application, you will have looked at local context, such as where there is a need for places and how existing local schools are performing. You should use this information now to target your efforts.</p>

<h4>Understanding the particular forms of disadvantage that affect the local community in which your school will be based</h4>

<p>You should use this information to attract applications from disadvantaged groups, for example, by running taster days for pupils from local primary schools that have a high level of disadvantage in their intake. By effectively targeting disadvantaged groups, you will contribute towards closing the attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils, by enabling them to benefit from the high-quality education that your new free school will provide.</p>

<h4>Post-16 institutions</h4>

<p>You will be aware of the number of young people locally who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) and the skills gap identified by employers. You can use this information now to target your efforts. For example, you can work with the local careers office to target NEETs</p>

<h4>Engagement with local authority</h4>

<p>Engage with the local authority in which your school will be based so that the provision that your school will offer for pupils with SEND can be included in the local authority’s local offer. This is particularly important for special schools, but also applies to mainstream schools.</p>

<h4>Spokesperson</h4>

<p>It is a good idea to have a dedicated spokesperson so you have a consistent profile, especially as far as local media are concerned, so they always know whom to contact.</p>

<h4>Local radio</h4>

<p>Local radio is a powerful tool. You can book paid advertising space (though you will need to book slots well in advance), but you can also get free publicity by suggesting creative ideas for programme content, such as offering a spokesperson for an on-air debate or phone-in programme.</p>

<h4>Named contact for public relations</h4>

<p>When dealing with the media, try to get a named contact. Find out who is the education correspondent for your local newspaper, or the relevant programme producer for local radio stations, and give them a call. Make sure they know who will be sending them information, and who in your group they can contact if they need to.</p>

<h4>Local feeder schools</h4>

<p>Engage with local feeder schools, if applicable. Offer to speak at assemblies or have a presence at school events such as parents’ evenings and transition days.</p>

<h4>Faith schools</h4>

<p>If you are a faith school, make sure you make contact with and have the support of your religious body and, if relevant, broader local religious organisations.</p>

<h4>Newsletters</h4>

<p>Consider producing regular newsletters. You can distribute printed copies locally, or via email to your contact list. You can use an online email marketing company to send out mailshots, often at little or no cost.</p>

<h4>Landline and mobiles</h4>

<p>If you do not have a permanent site, you will not have a landline. Rather than use a mobile number as a contact point, which can create a sense of impermanence, there are programmes you can use to ‘convert’ your mobile number to a landline number – which you can then continue to use once the school is open.</p>

<h4>Translations into other languages</h4>

<p>Make sure you translate your leaflets and newsletters into languages which reflect the make-up of your local community.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span>Online</h3>

<p>It is essential that you have comprehensive information available on your website, and that the website is updated regularly. It will help to have a dedicated member of the trust to maintain the site. It is best to set up an email account using the school’s name, rather than an individual’s, to project a more professional image. Make sure that all enquiries are followed up quickly and ask correspondents if they are happy to add their email addresses to your contact list for information and updates.</p>

<p>Consider setting up an online forum for parents, young people and, in the case of special or alternative provision schools, potential commissioners, to make it easy for them to raise any questions or concerns. Many areas now have local online community forums, so start a discussion thread with some information about your school. Again, it is important to respond quickly and follow up queries. In addition, think about setting up a blog, Twitter or Instagram account with regular updates on your progress.</p>

<p>You can also maintain your profile locally and nationally, especially with the media, by creating and managing social media platforms. For example, using a Twitter account for the school as a newsfeed will allow you to communicate links to important announcements on your website, and issue timely reminders about meetings or important deadlines. Or, if you want to engage young people directly (for example, if your school is a post-16 free school), then Facebook can be an effectively way to target messages (by location and interest).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span>Face-to-face</h3>

<p>Previous proposer groups have found that face-to-face contact with parents and prospective commissioners has proved especially effective and can build on any written or online information you have produced. It can be as simple as knocking on doors and canvassing opinion and support. Be prepared to put in time and effort to engage with the community as a whole and make your group known to people.</p>

<p>Events provide an effective platform to display your free school and can provide an opportunity for parents and pupils to meet the principal designate and teaching staff. Make sure you have application forms available at these events – take parents’ details and follow-up with an email or leaflets.</p>

<p>Previous groups have also found that holding events with a theme can attract more people and give them a fuller flavour of what your school would be like. Mock lessons and enrichment days that demonstrate the school’s pedagogy (for example, creative writing sessions, fun science experiments, dancing and singing, or creating a performance) have been popular.</p>

<p>After the announcement of GCSE results, and even AS level results (as some students switch schools or colleges after year 12), it’s useful to have a stall in a public place to recruit students and to publicise this in advance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Admissions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>This section will provide you with tools to help ensure you have a clear, fair and compliant admission or referral process. It will set out the admissions processes for the different types of free schools.</p>

<p>You have set out the vision for your school, which may be to improve standards in a particular area or address a deficit of places, your admission arrangements can help you make that a reality. For example, you may intend to prioritise places for children from disadvantaged families and you can achieve this by giving priority in your arrangements to children eligible for the pupil premium.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Summary of this section</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>You must have admission or referral policies that comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">school admissions code</a> or the relevant guidance (depending on the type of school).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-admissions">relevant admission template</a> in drafting your policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must not arrange for your school to be included in the local authority co-ordinated admissions process without seeking prior agreement from your delivery officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DfE will offer you advice on developing your school’s first set of admission arrangements (mainstream or 16 to 19 free schools), or your referral policy (alternative provision or special free schools), but you are responsible for getting these arrangements right. You will need to understand the requirement to have clear and fair admission or referral policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are opening a mainstream free school, DfE expect you to consider how you could use your admission arrangements to enable pupils from different backgrounds to access the school, to promote a pupil intake that reflects the diversity of the wider local community.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>Risks</h3>

<p>Your admission or referral arrangements must be strong enough to withstand challenge. Unlawful admission arrangements can result in significant resource issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complex or overly prescriptive admission arrangements could put off potential applicants</li>
  <li>previously, a significant number of admission policies and application forms submitted to DfE failed to comply with the school admissions code – for this reason, schools must now use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-admissions">admissions templates</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span>Essential information you must provide</h3>

<p>During the pre-opening phase, you must provide your delivery officer with a copy of your proposed admission policy, referral policy and statement of provision, including any catchment area maps and application forms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span>Mainstream free school admissions</h3>

<p>Because your school will be an academy, the trust is the admission authority. This means it is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making sure your school’s admission arrangements comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">school admissions code</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">school admission appeals code</a>, including the code requirement that the arrangements should be fair, clear and objective</li>
  <li>consulting on the proposed admission arrangements, before you open, as part of the consultation you will carry out under Section 10 of the Act</li>
  <li>complying with the mandatory requirement to admit all pupils with an educational health and care plan (EHC plan) naming the free school and to have regard to the SEN code of practice</li>
  <li>determining(or finalising) the school’s admission policy, once you have your funding agreement in place</li>
  <li>consulting on and determining future admission arrangements after the school opens, in accordance with paragraphs 1.42-1.49 of the school admissions code</li>
  <li>managing applications to the school, you will be responsible for this in the first year (either by managing the process directly, or agreeing that the local authority will do it) and the local authority will do this as part of its co-ordinated process in subsequent years</li>
  <li>organising an independent admission appeals panel (or contracting this out) in compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">school admission appeals code</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Every mainstream free school must operate within the local fair access protocol. This is established by the local authority to ensure that, outside the normal admissions round, unplaced children, especially the most vulnerable, are offered a place at a suitable school as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.6 </span>Nursery admissions</h3>

<p>The school admissions code does not apply to nurseries, including those that are part of a school. As such, there is no requirement on them to adopt objective admissions criteria.</p>

<p>It is possible for schools to prioritise children, for admission to reception year, who attend a nursery that is part of the school, or established and run by the school, in their criteria for admission to reception. However, you must ensure that giving priority is fair to local parents who choose not to send their child to nursery, taking into account the location of the school, the availability of reception places in the area and the number of places offered without any reference to whether the child has attended the nursery. In most cases, such arrangements are likely to be unfair, and vulnerable to objection, if few or no places are available to other children once those attending the nursery have been admitted to reception. In such circumstances, it is strongly recommended that your nursery admission policy is the same or similar to your policy for admission to reception, to minimise the risk of objection. You must discuss this with your delivery officer, to ensure that your policy for admission to reception is compliant with the school admissions code.</p>

<p>Within any priority given to nursery children, the school may prioritise those children attending the nursery who are eligible for the early years pupil premium, the pupil premium or the service premium above other children attending from the nursery (paragraph 1.39B of the schools admissions code).</p>

<p>Fee-paying nurseries cannot be named as a feeder institution to your free school. However, it is possible to give priority to those paying fees for their child’s nursery provision only where any fee is for additional provision above the ‘free’ 15 or 30-hour funded early education offer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.7 </span>The admissions process (including co-ordination)</h3>

<p>In your first year of opening, our normal expectation is that you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operate your own admissions process</li>
  <li>arrange for the local authority to process admissions on your behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, this should be done outside the local authority’s co-ordinated admissions process. You must not arrange for your school to be included in the local authority co-ordinated admissions process without seeking prior agreement from your delivery officer.</p>

<p>After your first year of opening, your admissions must be handled through the local authority’s co-ordinated admissions arrangements, like all other schools in the area. However, while your project is at the pre-opening phase, local authorities cannot offer places at your school under the co-ordinated admissions process until the Secretary of State has entered into a funding agreement with the trust. This is because, in law, a local authority can only make a firm offer for a place at an open school.</p>

<p>Your delivery officer will not advise the Secretary of State to enter into a funding agreement for your school until we are confident that it will open successfully on its proposed date.</p>

<p>It is important to make sure parents applying for your school are not left without a place, or with a place at a school they would not have chosen, if for any reason your school’s opening is delayed. Parents should make an application for other schools as well as yours, by submitting the common application form (CAF) to their home local authority.</p>

<p>Unless you choose option 2a, you will need to produce an application form and set out the application process in the admission policy, including the closing date for applications, the (conditional) offer date, and where to submit the application.</p>

<h4>Option 1: the school to handle the application process in-house</h4>

<p>Parents make a stand-alone application for a place directly to the free school. The school will provide an application form, set the application deadline and offer day and manage the process of considering applications and making offers itself.</p>

<p>You should encourage parents who apply to your school to submit a CAF to their home local authority to apply for other schools as well, in case your school doesn’t open in time. If your funding agreement is not signed by national offer day, you can make conditional offers, while parents can accept the place allocated by the local authority at an existing school as an insurance place. If your school’s funding agreement has been signed by the national offer day, you will be able to make firm offers.</p>

<p>Even if you manage the application process yourself, the local authority must still publish the school’s admissions policy in its composite prospectus and online.</p>

<h4>Option 2: the school’s local authority to handle the application process for the school</h4>

<p>There are two ways the local authority could manage the process for your school. Local authorities are under no duty to process admissions for proposed free schools before they have a funding agreement in place, so if you want to do this you will need to secure agreement from your home and neighbouring authorities.</p>

<h4>Option 2a</h4>

<p>The local authority handles the admission process as if the school were in co-ordination, but if the funding agreement is not signed by national offer day, the local authority would make a conditional offer for the free school alongside a firm offer for another open school.</p>

<p>Parents would submit the CAF to their home local authority, naming the free school as one of their preferences, and normal deadlines would apply (31 October for secondary schools and 15 January for primary schools). Parents would be encouraged to name other preferences as well, in case the free school doesn’t open in time.</p>

<p>This option is unlikely to be open to free schools where their final admission policies are not in place in time for them to be fully included in this process. It is not possible for proposed schools in any of the local authorities included in pan-London co-ordination (the process whereby the 33 London boroughs, the City of London Authority, Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire and Thurrock local authorities co-operate in a computerised allocation system), because the process adopted by these local authorities does not permit a conditional offer to be made alongside a firm offer for another school.</p>

<h4>Option 2b</h4>

<p>The local authority handles applications for the school outside co-ordination.</p>

<p>Parents would fill in the school’s application form and submit this to the local authority along with a CAF expressing a preference for other schools, in case the free school doesn’t open in time. You would need to decide whether to use the national deadlines and offer days or specify different dates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.8 </span>Composite prospectus</h3>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide information about school choices in their local area and must publish a composite prospectus each year by 12 September. When a provisional opening date is agreed for a free school, DfE writes to the relevant local authority to let them know in which year the school is expected to open. From that point on, the local authority should take steps to ensure information about the free school is included in its prospectus and must include your school’s admissions policy once it is finalised.</p>

<p>The local authority is required to keep the composite prospectus under review as admission policies change (for example, as a result of adjudicator determinations on admissions or new schools opening). Once DfE has indicated that your policy appears to comply with the school admissions code, it should be determined as final and submitted to the local authority. The local authority is required by the school admissions code to provide information on schools opening during the year and to update its website to provide information on your school’s admission policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.9 </span>Your admission arrangements</h3>

<p>DfE have developed comprehensive guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-schools-admissions">free school admissions</a> to help you develop your first set of arrangements. You must use the admissions template when drafting an admission policy and use the oversubscription criteria/admission processes within the template when drafting the policy. Arrangements, including application forms, must be clear, fair and objective, and must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">school admissions code</a>.</p>

<p>Promoting integration between people from different ethnic, religious and socioeconomic backgrounds is a priority for the government. Where a mainstream school’s oversubscription criteria is based around proximity to the school, the school’s intake might not represent the diversity of the wider local area. Your delivery officer will expect to see evidence that you have considered whether the school’s oversubscription criteria will enable pupils from a range of backgrounds that represents the diversity of the wider local community to access the school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.10 </span>Appeals</h3>

<p>Parents whose children have not been offered a place at your free school have the right to appeal, and your admission arrangements must include information about this.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the trust to set up an independent appeals panel in accordance with the school admission appeals code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> but local authorities, as well as other bodies, will run appeals services and you may want to consider buying into one of these to run your appeals.</p>

<p>If you want to manage your school’s own appeals, you should be prepared to commit time, money and resources to it. You will need to ensure the appeals panel is completely independent of the school and trust. Whether or not you contract out the service, it is the trust’s responsibility to ensure that panel members and the clerk are properly trained in accordance with the requirements of the school admission appeals code. Additional non-statutory advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/admission-appeals-for-school-places">school admission appeals</a> is available for admission authorities, clerks and appeal panels, and parents and guardians.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.11 </span>Consulting on your school’s admission arrangements</h3>

<p>In the pre-opening period, you should include at least an outline of your proposed admission arrangements as part of your Section 10 consultation and should take into account any responses you receive. Once the school’s funding agreement is signed and the arrangements are determined and published, you cannot make any further changes, other than where permitted by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">school admissions code</a>.</p>

<p>Once your school is open, you will need to consult, in accordance with the school admissions code, on your admission arrangements if you propose any changes, and at least every seven years even if you do not want to make any changes. You will have to carry out your consultation in the academic year before the new arrangements would take effect. This means that there is nearly a two-year lead-in period before you admit children according to any changed arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.12 </span>Special free schools</h3>

<p>Recruitment and admission to special free schools is via an EHC plan made by a local authority, which names the school. The only exception to this is where the Secretary of State has agreed, in the funding agreement, that the school can also admit a minority of pupils with the type of special educational needs the school specialises in, but without an EHC plan. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">SEND code of practice</a> for details. Such innovative proposals will only be approved as an exception, and only if a strong case can be made.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that as the admissions authority for your school, it is the trust’s responsibility to get things right. This includes:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Setting out the school’s age range, number of pupils with EHC plans provided for and type of SEN specialised in as part of the consultation you will carry out under Section 10 of the Act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complying with the mandatory requirement to admit all pupils with an EHC plan that names the free school and to have regard to the SEN code of practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publishing the school’s SEN ‘statement of provision’ on the school’s website. You must draft your policy using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/506004/Special_Free_School_Statement_of_Provision_Template.docx">statement of provision template</a>. Additional guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/506010/Special_Free_School_Admissions_Guidance.pdf">special free school admissions</a> is also available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separately publishing on the school website any other narrative which sets the scene in terms of the proposed free school’s target cohort or policies, including methods of teaching or curricular or specialist offer.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Children with EHC plans</h4>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to, where necessary, identify, assess and arrange provision for children with SEN. Where a local authority has carried out a statutory assessment and decided to issue an EHC plan, it will issue a draft plan to parents. Parents can request for the local authority to name their preferred choice of school in their child’s EHC plan. The local authority must take into account parental requests and must consult with a school where it is intending to name it in an EHC plan. However, the final decision on the school to be named rests with the local authority responsible for maintaining the plan.</p>

<p>A special free school must admit a child where the school is named in a child’s EHC plan, even if the child’s SEN is not a type of SEN for which the school is designated. A special school is organised to make educational provision for any pupils with SEN. They are designated for specific type(s) of SEN and the main designations of SEN are set out in the SEN code of practice. Once a school is open, approval from the Secretary of State would be required if it wished to change or extend its designation to other types of SEN. It should publish details of its provision and capacity online.</p>

<p>A school has a duty to comply with an EHC plan. If a school disagrees with being named on an EHC plan, it can appeal to the Secretary of State through the ESFA. It should only do so if attempts have already been made to resolve disagreements at the local level. Complaints can only be considered under limited circumstances: if the local authority has acted unreasonably or has failed to carry out one of its important duties under the Education Acts, including its SEN duties.</p>

<p>If parents disagree with a school being named in their child’s EHC plan, they have a right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal (SEND). Decisions of the tribunal are binding on all parties.</p>

<p>If a special free school is allowed within its funding agreement to admit children without an EHC plan, the process for admitting these pupils must be set out in an admissions policy that complies with the school admissions code. Delivery officers will be able to provide more information on this.</p>

<h4>Consulting on your school’s arrangements</h4>

<p>In the pre-opening period, DfE advise that you set out details of the size and type of the provision your school will offer and any proposed admission arrangements (if admitting children with SEN but without an EHC plan) within your Section 10 consultation. Once you have taken account of any responses to your consultation, published your final arrangements on your website and signed your funding agreement, you should not make any changes to the arrangements.</p>

<p>Once your school is open, you will need to consult on your admission arrangements for children with SEN but without an EHC plan if you propose any changes, in accordance with the school admissions code and at least every 7 years even if you don’t want to make any changes. You will have to carry out your consultation in the academic year before the new arrangements would take effect. This means that there is nearly a two-year lead-in period before you admit children according to any changed arrangements.</p>

<p>If you wish to make any changes to the type of special needs the school specialises in or the size of the school, age-range, or similar, this will require a change to your school’s funding agreement to be agreed with the ESFA on behalf of the Secretary of State once the school is open.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.13 </span>Alternative provision free schools</h3>

<p>Alternative provision (AP) free schools must be principally concerned with providing full-time or part-time education for children of compulsory school age who may not otherwise receive suitable education for any period because of illness, exclusion, or another reason. This means that the majority of pupils (over 50%) must be of compulsory school age (between 5 and 16 years old). AP free schools may also choose to cater for some 16 to 19-year-olds, but they must number less than 50% of your students.</p>

<p>Children of compulsory school age can only be admitted to an alternative provision free school by being referred by commissioners (local authorities or schools), using their existing referral powers or duties.</p>

<p>AP free schools have the freedom to adopt a policy whereby students or their parents can choose to apply for a post-16 place, but this is not compulsory. Applications to AP free schools for post-16 places should be managed through the same process as applications to 16 to 19 provision at mainstream schools. It is not compulsory for a student to attend a specific school or college post-16, so any referral system for students over compulsory school age would also require an application from the student to ensure they were willing to attend.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">school admissions code</a> does not apply to referrals or post-16 admissions at an AP free school. AP free schools can adopt code-compliant post-16 arrangements if they wish, but the minimum requirement is that they follow our guidelines on admissions to 16 to 19 free schools.</p>

<p>As an academy trust, you are responsible for ensuring that the referral policy and any post-16 admissions policy comply with the funding agreement. That means they must be fair, transparent and objective, admit any pupils with statements of special educational needs or an EHC plan naming the school, and give highest priority to looked-after children and previously looked-after children.</p>

<p>Your referral or admission policy should include:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Your school’s referral process for children of compulsory school age, ensuring that it complies with referral powers and duties. Need is assessed by the commissioner, so it should not include an additional process for the school to consider the need for a referral other than to determine that the child is genuinely not suitable for mainstream education. The school should include a tie-break to decide which student is admitted if there are more referrals than places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your school’s referral or application process for post-16 provision, if applicable. You need to state whether applications from post-16 students will only be accepted if they have also been referred by commissioners, or whether they can also apply independently of any referral. You will need to set out how you will admit pupils in a fair, objective and transparent way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A process for consulting on and finalising the new arrangements if you want to change your school’s admission or referral arrangements once the school has opened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A process for managing referrals to the school, ensuring systems are in place to manage and track referrals from the opening date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information to make sure that unsuccessful commissioners and others are aware that they can submit complaints about the referral process or complaints about the post-16 admission arrangements to the ESFA.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternative provision free schools should be aware of the fair access protocol. It is the mechanism for ensuring children who are hard to place are allocated a school place quickly during the school year. The requirements in relation to alternative provision are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-provision">alternative provision statutory guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Referrals: commissioners’ responsibilities</h4>

<p>Statutory guidance sets out the government’s expectations of local authorities and maintained schools that commission alternative provision and pupil referral units. The government expects those who are not legally required to have regard to the statutory guidance (for instance, academies) to use it as a guide to good practice.</p>

<p>Local authorities are responsible for arranging suitable education for permanently excluded pupils, and for other pupils who, because of illness or other reasons, would not receive suitable education without such arrangements being made.</p>

<p>Governing bodies of schools are responsible for arranging suitable full-time education from the sixth day of a fixed-period exclusion. Schools may also direct pupils off-site for education to help improve their behaviour.</p>

<h4>The referrals or admissions process</h4>

<p>Statutory guidance sets out that there should be clear criteria for referring and admitting pupils, including those who are dual registered. Pupils should be dual registered from the beginning of the first day on which the school has commissioned the alternative provision. For the purpose of the school census, a pupil should be dual main registered at their school and dual subsidiary registered at the alternative provision.</p>

<p>As part of your school’s published referral policy, you will need to decide how you will effectively manage referrals and engagement with your commissioners throughout the academic year. If you also want to admit pupils, by application, to any post-16 provision, you will need also to adopt an admissions policy.</p>

<p>The referral policy and any admissions policy should be part of the same document. For your referral process, you will need to be clear and open about how it operates. It is important that you are clear about the type of cohort you wish to cater for so that potential commissioners will understand the type of provision you offer. Your published referral/admissions policy should make it clear to commissioners how and when to make referrals. Your criteria should be fair and objective so it is clear how decisions are made; this will also minimise the chance of potential challenges or complaints.</p>

<p>Schools are required to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/512994/Alternative_Provision_Free_School_Referral-Template.docx">AP referral template</a> to draft their referral policy. A model commissioner’s referral form is also included.</p>

<h4>Consulting on your referral and admission arrangements</h4>

<p>In the pre-opening period, DfE advise that you include your referral and, if relevant, admissions policy as part of your Section 10 consultation. Once you have taken account of any responses to your consultation, published your final policy on your website and signed your funding agreement, you should not make any changes to the arrangements during the rest of the school year.</p>

<p>If you admit students post-16 (through student application), your policy should be reviewed and published on an annual basis to take account of changing demographics in your area. DfE recommend that you consult local people on any changes and publish your policy each year in September, for the following September’s admissions. For example, your policy for 2022 admissions should therefore be published in September 2021 or as early as possible if this is not achievable.</p>

<p>You should also keep your policy on referrals under regular review and respond to any demographic changes.</p>

<p>It is possible for people to submit complaints about your referral and admissions policy to ESFA, which will ensure that the policy is fair, clear and objective, in accordance with the funding agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.14 </span>16 to 19 free schools</h3>

<p>As an academy trust, you are responsible for admissions to your free school. This means you are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making sure the free school’s admission arrangements are fair, objective and transparent</li>
  <li>managing applications to the institution (in most cases you will need to manage these directly, although in some areas post-16 institutions co-operate to co-ordinate admissions)</li>
  <li>organising an independent admission appeals process</li>
</ul>

<p>As 16 to 19 free schools are not legally schools but educational institutions, your free school is not covered by the school admissions code. However, its admission arrangements do need to be fair, clear and objective. Parents and prospective students still need a clear understanding of how and when places are offered, whether there are minimum entry requirements, whether there will be a test or an interview as part of the application process and which criteria will be used to decide how applications will be prioritised. Arrangements should therefore be as straightforward as possible and be clear how criteria are to be applied.</p>

<p>Unlike mainstream schools, there are no national co-ordinated deadlines for when applications to post-16 institutions need to be made. Institutions generally set their own deadlines based on how large or oversubscribed they are (and therefore how long they need to consider initial applications). Our strong advice is that you should aim to make provisional offers to students in the spring term, so that applicants are clear about any academic conditions you will place on their offer sufficiently in advance of sitting their exams in the summer. An outline timeline might look like this:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Invite applications from the autumn, with an initial application deadline no later than early spring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sift applications and apply selection criteria during the spring term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make conditional or unconditional offers before Easter, so students are clear what requirements they will need to meet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm places once students have received their GCSE or A level results in August (or earlier if you are offering unconditional places or places based on predicted grades).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You will need to include your timeline in your admissions policy, making it clear to students and parents how and when to apply.</p>

<h4>The admissions process</h4>

<p>You are required to draft your admission policy using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/506008/16-19_Free_School_Admissions_Template.docx">template</a> on GOV.UK. Your criteria should be fair and objective so it is clear how decisions will be made; this will also minimise the chance of potential challenges or complaints. There are some important things all admission arrangements should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an admission number for the institution, or admission numbers for courses, for each year of entry into the institution – this number sets the minimum number of pupils the free school will admit each year</li>
  <li>clear oversubscription criteria</li>
  <li>details of how and when applications can be made</li>
  <li>an application form</li>
  <li>details of a waiting list</li>
  <li>details of your independent appeals process</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oversubscription criteria</h4>

<p>If you have more applications than places, you will need to apply clear oversubscription criteria to help you allocate places fairly. As a 16 to 19 academy, you have a great deal of flexibility about how you admit students. You can select by criteria such as ability, qualifications, tests, but if you choose to do this, you must be clear about your intentions from the start and explain in your admissions policy the requirements necessary to be admitted.</p>

<p>You can set specific requirements for specific courses, and you can turn down applicants you have offered places to if they do not subsequently meet the academic requirements. Beware of setting your minimum criteria too high or making the application process too onerous for students: you do not want to have empty places in September. If you have more qualified applicants than places, you can sift them by applying your published admissions criteria.</p>

<p>You are required to admit all students with an EHC plan naming the free school. Although you are not required to, DfE would encourage you to give first priority within your oversubscription criteria to looked-after children and previously looked-after children.</p>

<p>You then need to list the rest of your free school’s oversubscription criteria in order. You need to think carefully about these and make sure they strike the right balance between admitting the students who will thrive and benefit most from the provision you offer, without being overly complex, burdensome, or inadvertently disadvantaging a prospective student.</p>

<h4>Offering places</h4>

<p>Once your application deadline has passed and you have applied the admission criteria, you can choose to make either conditional or unconditional offers. Before your funding agreement is signed, you should only make conditional offers, in case there is any delay in opening. You do not need to have signed your funding agreement to make conditional offers, but you should advise your prospective students that they may wish to have an ‘insurance’ place.</p>

<p>At the point DfE is ready to enter into a funding agreement with you, your delivery officer will want to know how many formal applications have been made, and from March onwards how many conditional offers have been made and how many offers have been accepted. Information about ‘expressions of interest’ will generally not suffice.</p>

<h4>Finalising choices</h4>

<p>Unlike a school with a sixth form where students can move into year 12 in the same institution, you need to create opportunities to engage with students after you have offered them a place. It is beneficial to both you and them if you continue to get to know them and help them finalise their plans, such as which A levels or vocational subjects they want to study. This will help you plan timetables and teaching loads and helps ensure students have a strong start at your institution. Subject to government guidance on social distancing, DfE suggest you host a ‘getting ready’ day for students, much like a secondary school would hold an induction for students moving from primary schools.</p>

<p>It is also important to have opportunities to meet with students individually between GCSE or A level results and the start of term, in case they or you think they might need to adjust their plans.</p>

<h4>Waiting lists</h4>

<p>You should keep a clear, fair and transparent waiting list and be clear as to how long you will keep it. Our advice is that you should keep a waiting list up until the first day of the academic year - many post-16 institutions choose to maintain it for a longer period. Students on the list should be ranked in line with your published oversubscription criteria.</p>

<h4>Appeals</h4>

<p>Students who have not been offered a place at your free school should have the right to appeal. Your admission arrangements must tell students about their right to appeal and the process, deadline and contact details for making an appeal.</p>

<p>Local authorities, as well as other organisations, will operate an appeals service for school admissions, and you may want to consider buying into that service to run your appeals process. In doing so, you need to make sure they understand that as a 16 to 19 academy you do not have to abide by the school admissions code or the school admissions appeals code.</p>

<p>If you want to manage your own appeals, you should be prepared to commit time, money and resources to it. You will need to set up an appeals panel, which should be independent of the institution. It should comprise a clerk and DfE advise, at least 2 other people. We strongly recommend you provide training for all panel members.</p>

<h4>Administration and verification of information</h4>

<p>In operating your admission arrangements, you can request proof that the information provided in the application form is valid. For example, you can ask for proof of address to confirm that a student lives where they say they do but recognise that many students won’t have access to the same types of proof of address that their parents would. You must not ask for evidence that includes, for example, parents’ financial or marital status, or first languages of the parents and family.</p>

<h4>Consulting on your arrangements</h4>

<p>In the pre-opening period, DfE advise that you include your 16 to 19 free school’s proposed admission arrangements as part of your Section 10 consultation. Once you have taken account of any responses to your consultation and published your final arrangements on your website and DfE have signed your funding agreement, you should not make any changes to the arrangements until the application process is over for the year. It should be reviewed and published on an annual basis to take account of changing demographics in your area. DfE recommend that you consult local people on any changes and publish your policy each year in September for the following September’s admissions. Your policy for 2022 admissions should therefore be published in September 2021, or as early as possible after that if this is not achievable.</p>

<p>It is possible for people to submit complaints about your policy to ESFA, which will ensure that the policy is fair, clear and objective, in accordance with the funding agreement.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Religious character</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>If you would like particular beliefs to be reflected in the life of your school, and specifically in your curriculum, staffing and admissions policies, DfE require you to seek a ‘religious designation’. This is a legal recognition that your school will have a religious character. A faith-designated free school has the following freedoms which will allow you to maintain and develop the religious character of the school:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply up to 50% of pupil admissions by reference to faith (when the school is oversubscribed)</li>
  <li>appoint teachers by reference to faith</li>
  <li>deliver religious education and collective worship according to the tenets of the faith of the school</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a separate application and your school’s religious designation will not come into force until you have signed your funding agreement with the Secretary of State and the legal process for religious designation has been completed.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the freedoms set out above are not available to free schools that wish to register as having a ‘faith ethos’ (a part of the independent school registrations process).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span>Applying for a religious designation</h3>

<p>For your school to have a religious designation, you will have to satisfy the Secretary of State that the conduct of the school or the provision of education is, or will be, in accordance with the tenets of one or more religions or religious denominations and that one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some or all of the premises to be occupied by the school will be provided on trust in connection with:
    <ul>
      <li>the provision of education</li>
      <li>in connection with the conduct of an educational institution in accordance with the tenets of one or more religions or religious denominations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>at least one trustee is a person appointed to represent the interests of one or more religions or religious denominations</li>
  <li>the governing instrument of the school provides that the school shall be conducted or some or all of the education shall be provided, in accordance with the tenets of one or more religions or religious denominations</li>
</ul>

<p>In advance of approving a religious designation application, the Secretary of State may consult the relevant religious authority, or any other religious body. The Secretary of State will need to be assured that your school will be managed in accordance with the tenets of your faith.</p>

<p>To apply for religious designation, you need to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/276172/para_9-6_and_9-23_free_schools_faith_form.docx">FSRDApp1 form</a> and return it to your delivery officer for processing as soon as possible. The guidance can be found via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/religious-character-designation-guide-to-applying">religious character designation: guide to applying</a>.</p>

<p>Note that 16 to 19, special and AP free schools cannot be designated as having a religious character, although they may have an ethos or worldview that is reflected within the vision and values of the school.</p>

<p>Faith-designated free schools with nursery provision are able to reflect their religious outlook within the life of the nursery, for example, by celebrating religious festivals or using stories based on religious texts. They are not permitted to apply any faith criteria for admissions to nursery places, and the nursery must abide by the same requirements in the funding agreement and regulations as apply to the rest of the school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span>Additional responsibilities for faith free schools</h3>

<p>The government is keen for all schools to support inclusivity and integration between communities. All schools must be inclusive, whatever their religious character or ethos. Trusts that are opening a faith designated free school will be expected to provide evidence of their commitment to inclusivity and community cohesion and plans to support this, which will be tested rigorously throughout pre-opening. There are a number of ways you could demonstrate your commitment to inclusivity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>plans to develop a sustained and structured linking programme with a school of a different or no religious designation, to create meaningful relationships between young people of different faiths (or no faith) – linking could include sharing teachers and resources, conducting joint lessons, assemblies or sporting activities</li>
  <li>having diversity on the trust’s board by including one or more members or trustees who is of another faith or no faith</li>
  <li>setting up a mixed-faith trust with schools of different faiths or no faith that will be used to expose pupils in your faith designated school to peers from different religious and ethnic backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>DfE expect faith-designated free schools to appeal to a wide range of parents and pupils. You therefore need to ensure that your school policies are inclusive, your school is welcoming to pupils of other faiths or no faith and that your school is likely to attract applications from all parts of the local community, not just those of your faith. This includes ensuring that your school policies and curriculum would not deter pupils from other faiths or no faith from applying for a place at the school, nor prevent their children from playing a full part in the life of the school. Policies that might deter applicants from other faiths or no faith a combination of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lessons taught in community languages</li>
  <li>large proportions of curriculum time devoted to faith-related studies</li>
  <li>restrictive dietary requirements</li>
  <li>any separation of pupils, including when they are eating</li>
  <li>the mandatory wearing of symbols or clothing associated with your faith or world view</li>
</ul>

<p>Parents have the right to withdraw their children from religious education at any age and from collective worship until the age of 16. From the age of 16, the right to opt out of collective worship passes to the pupil.</p>

<p>Like all free schools, you must also adhere to the conditions set out in your funding agreement. You will also need to demonstrate a commitment to ensuring that your curriculum and ethos will prepare pupils for life in modern Britain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span>What a religious authority does and how trusts can find one</h3>

<p>Most faith schools will be formed by groups that look to a religious body or organisation for guidance on how their religious character should be expressed in the life of the school. Therefore, in most cases you will have a ‘religious authority’ who will have two consultation roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying who will conduct the inspection of your school’s religious education and collective worship (commonly known as the Section 48 inspection)</li>
  <li>providing advice on admission arrangements and specifically consulting with them on how you should define suitable adherence to your faith in your admission arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to inspection of your denominational education or collective worship, the faith bodies that provide inspection services are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Church of England or Roman Catholic - the appropriate diocesan authority</li>
  <li>Jewish - Jewish Studies Education Inspection Service</li>
  <li>Methodist - Education Secretary to the Methodist Church</li>
  <li>Muslim -Association of Muslim Schools UK</li>
  <li>Sikh - Network of Sikh Organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not compulsory for you to use these faith bodies to carry out these inspections but you are required to consult with the appropriate body (if one is listed) before you opt to organise it independently. There is a protocol that you must follow in order to claim grant funding towards the cost of inspection. You will need to draw up a framework and provide details and assurances about the independence of the inspectors you are using and submit the framework and inspection report to DfE before any grant can be considered towards the cost of inspection. Contact your delivery officer for advice.</p>

<p>The religious authorities in relation to admission arrangements are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/cy/uksi/2012/8/made?view=plain" rel="external">Schedule 3 of the School Admissions (Admission Arrangements and Co-ordination of Admission Arrangements) (England) 2012</a></p>

<p>If your faith is not covered by any of the bodies listed above, for example, groups intending to seek designation as ‘Christian’, you will need to identify an alternative body. Please get in touch with your delivery officer for advice.</p>

<p>You should also get in touch with your delivery officer if your faith is covered by the list above, but your intention is to name an alternative religious body.</p>

<p>You should be clear about the role you intend the religious authority to play in the design and running of your school, beyond the consultation role required by law.</p>

<p>Those groups opening a free school designated with a Church of England religious character will also need to agree to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/church-academies-model-documents">church supplemental agreement</a> alongside their funding agreement. This document provides more detail on the roles of the diocesan board, the trust and DfE and how they will work together on issues relating to land, intervention and support and termination.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span>Recruiting teachers before the school obtains religious designation</h3>

<p>Being a designated faith free school gives you limited exemptions from the Equality Act 2010 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#equality-duties">(see section 12)</a>. This includes being able to give preference to recruiting teachers of the faith.</p>

<p>To be designated officially, you will need to have signed a funding agreement with the Secretary of State and have successfully applied for designation. If you wish to appoint teachers before you are designated, you will need to be able to demonstrate that adherence to a particular faith is a genuine occupational requirement (such as for the principal designate, or an RE teacher). Where this is the case, you may be able to advertise, hold interviews and employ teaching staff prior to the designation of the free school. However, wherever possible you should refrain from entering into an employment contract until you have obtained religious designation and signed a funding agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span>Free schools that register a faith ethos</h3>

<p>If you want your school to reflect a distinct ethos aligned with a particular religion, you can register that your school has a religious ethos. The ethos could then be reflected within the vision for the school, the values the school represents and the importance placed on particular beliefs.</p>

<p>Unlike schools that are faith designated, schools registered with a religious ethos are not entitled to any of the freedoms of designated faith schools, except in the appointment of senior leaders where the faith of candidates can be taken into account.</p>

<p>As with all other schools, your school will be expected to be inclusive in its outlook and practices and be likely to attract applications from pupils of no faith and other faiths. Your delivery officer will expect to see evidence of actions you are taking to encourage applications from the wider local community.</p>

<p>Throughout pre-opening, DfE will expect groups who are proposing a school that will have a religious ethos to be able to explain clearly how faith will (or will not) manifest itself in, and influence, the curriculum, school policies and the look and feel of the proposed school. DfE will also expect you to be able to demonstrate how you will make this clear to parents and pupils.</p>

<p>Schools with a faith ethos, in common with all schools without a religious designation, can apply to be exempted from the requirement to provide broadly Christian collective worship. This may be where the belief of the majority of its pupils or the local community is such that another faith would be more appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Equality duties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Free schools’ duties under the Equality Act 2010</h3>

<p>Every child in this country should have the opportunity to get the very best education, giving them knowledge and skills that set them up for life. The free schools programme supports equality of opportunity, through opening high-quality new schools in the areas where they are most needed.</p>

<p>The Equality Act 2010 provides a single, consolidated source of discrimination law and makes it unlawful for your trust to discriminate against, harass or victimise a pupil or potential pupil based on protected characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in relation to admissions</li>
  <li>in the way it provides education for pupils</li>
  <li>in the way it provides pupils access to any benefit, facility or service</li>
  <li>by excluding a pupil or subjecting them to any other detriment</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/149" rel="external">Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010</a> requires all public authorities when exercising their functions and making decisions to have due regard to the 3 limbs of the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED). These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under that Act</li>
  <li>to advance equality of opportunity between those who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not share it</li>
  <li>to foster good relations between those who share a relevant protected characteristic and those who do not share it</li>
</ul>

<p>Meeting your obligations under the Equality Act 2010 is a continuing obligation on your trust and must be considered throughout the pre-opening phase and once the school is open.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has a statutory duty to consider the potential equality impact (positive and negative) of their decision, before deciding whether to enter into a funding agreement with you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Summary of the main tasks</h3>

<p>Throughout the pre-opening period, you must consider how the decisions you make will affect people due to their protected characteristics.</p>

<p>The protected characteristics are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>disability</li>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
  <li>race</li>
  <li>religion or belief</li>
  <li>sex</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
</ul>

<p>You also need to note that discrimination on the grounds of marriage and civil partnership is unlawful.</p>

<p>A person’s age is also a protected characteristic in relation to employment and the Act extends this (except for children) to the provision of goods and services, but age as a protected characteristic does not apply to pupils in schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span>How DfE will work with you</h3>

<p>When making all your important decisions in pre-opening you must ensure you comply with the PSED. Your delivery officer will be looking for evidence that it is being considered throughout the pre-opening phase.</p>

<p>At meetings, you should aim to keep your delivery officer informed about how your equality duties are being met.</p>

<p>To show that consideration has been given to the relevant protected characteristics in the school plans and policies, some examples of the information your delivery officer will need are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of your marketing plan, to show how you will engage with local communities to meet your duties to promote community cohesion</li>
  <li>your staff recruitment policy, to show how you will ensure that all candidates will be treated in a fair and transparent way during the recruitment process</li>
  <li>your SEN policy, to show what provision will be available for the pupils at the school and what other specialist provision will be available</li>
</ul>

<p>Your delivery officer will keep a record of all pertinent information. This will help the Secretary of State to assess the impact on people with reference to the protected characteristics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>School food</h3>

<p>Since September 2014, all government-funded schools (including academies) must offer free school meals to every infant pupil. DfE is expecting all infant pupils to be offered a nutritious and, where possible, hot free meal.</p>

<p>The Children’s Food Trust (CFT) and the Lead Association for Catering in Education (LACA) run a free support service for schools that need help providing these universal infant free school meals (UIFSM). The support service can be contacted on 0800 680 0080, or by email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:info@childrensfoodtrust.org.uk">info@childrensfoodtrust.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Schools are encouraged to promote healthy eating and provide healthy and nutritious food and drink. The Requirements for School Food Standards Regulations 2014 apply to all government-funded schools (including academies). Guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-school-food-in-england">school food standards</a> is available online. A summary of the standards and a practical guide are available from the School Food Plan website.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Staffing, education plans and policies</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>During the pre-opening phase, you will need to turn the detailed staffing and education plans in your application into reality to ensure that everything is in place to open successfully, from recruiting high-quality staff to having high-quality education policies and schemes of work in place. You will need to ensure joint planning of finance, curriculum and staffing throughout the process, to deliver an affordable curriculum that meets pupils’ needs.</p>

<p>You will need to have some policies in place early for consultation and pupil recruitment. Others will be needed ahead of the readiness to open meeting (ROM) with DfE and the Ofsted pre-registration inspection. You should also consider what you will need ahead of your first full inspection, which will normally take place during the third year after opening.</p>

<p>You will also need to consider how you will ensure a manageable and sustainable workload for all staff as the school expands to aid recruitment and retention by ensuring that demands of staff are proportionate and reflect most efficient and effective practice.</p>

<p>You should be conscious of planning for the wellbeing of all staff, including the senior leader, and the need to implement flexible working practices in a way that promotes good work-life balance and supports teachers and leaders.</p>

<p>Flexible working can help to recruit, retain and motivate teachers, improve wellbeing, and to promote teacher diversity. Consider offering flexible working arrangements to all staff across the school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>An external expert (EE) will be allocated to your project and will provide advice through your delivery officer. EEs are external contractors and highly experienced education professionals who have worked in senior education roles, typically as heads of outstanding schools or as Ofsted HMIs.</p>

<p>Appointing a high-quality principal designate is probably the most important thing you will do as a trust during pre-opening. The recruitment process should not take place before the provisional opening date has been confirmed. Getting the right person is of critical importance to the success of your school. The principal designate will be involved in appointing other staff and writing the detailed education brief, education plans and policies and schemes of work you will need ahead of opening. It may take more than one recruitment round before a suitable candidate is appointed and this presents a risk to the successful opening of your school. If you are experiencing difficulties recruiting a principal designate, you must escalate this to your delivery officer.</p>

<p>All serving headteachers and teaching staff will be bound by contractual resignation dates and you will need to factor this into your recruitment plans. Appointments made before a funding agreement is in place should be conditional on the trust entering into the funding agreement and the school opening.</p>

<p>As a trust, you have statutory duties in terms of the policies that need to be in place before opening. DfE has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-policies-for-schools">guide for schools</a> (including free schools) about these duties. Education plans and policies are not routinely signed off by EEs but they will always review the pupil assessment, recording and reporting policy and safeguarding policy.</p>

<p>It is important that as an academy trust you fully understand your responsibilities for safeguarding the children in your care. You should consult DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">Keeping children safe in education</a>(KCSIE),  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">Working together to safeguard children</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-if-youre-worried-a-child-is-being-abused--2">What to do if you’re worried a child is being abused: advice for practitioners</a> guidance documents.</p>

<p>Your delivery officer will ask you to report on recruitment of staff (in the context of pupil recruitment and financial plans) and on the development of your education plans and policies, at specific points during the pre-opening process, including ahead of the Ofsted pre-registration inspection and at your readiness-to-open meeting (ROM).</p>

<p>You should consult DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-recruitment-and-retention-strategy">recruitment and retention strategy</a>  (published January 2019) to help you understand ways to create the right climate to establish supportive school cultures and ensure a manageable workload for all staff is planned for. In creating a culture that promotes flexible working, you have the potential to create new, innovative opportunities for addressing teacher supply, alongside promoting greater diversity in the workplace especially as the schools grows. To support you to implement effective flexible working practices DfE has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flexible-working-in-schools/flexible-working-in-schools--2">guidance and resources (2020) for flexible working in schools</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span>Risks</h3>

<p>Inspected schools that have not had a change in principal designate are more likely to receive a ‘good’ or better Ofsted judgement than those that have, so it is vital that you find the right person for the job. It may take a few attempts to recruit a suitable principal designate so it is sensible to consider when to begin the recruitment process very carefully as serving headteachers and teaching staff are bound by contractual resignation dates.</p>

<p>Over half of free school principal designates are new to the role. Where a principal designate candidate has no leadership experience or is a direct appointment, a benchmarking exercise should be carried out by an EE who will advise on the suitability of the candidate for the role. You should also think about the support and mentoring programme that you will provide to support them.</p>

<p>Although many free schools are keen to appoint newly qualified teachers (NQTs), it will be important, particularly for subject specialists in secondary schools, to consider where subject specific support might come from if there are no other specialists in the school in the first and even second year of opening. There might be a similar need for caution when recruiting senior or middle leaders. Having little relevant leadership experience can significantly limit leadership capacity at a time when it is needed to establish and implement school improvement systems.</p>

<p>Once you have your principal designate in post, it is important to get your wider tracking and assessment systems in place. Failure to do this may affect your ability to get a good Ofsted judgement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.4 </span>Essential information you’ll need to provide to DfE</h3>

<p>You’ll need to provide DfE with details of your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proposed staffing structure</li>
  <li>pupil assessment, recording and reporting policy</li>
  <li>safeguarding policy</li>
  <li>the education plans or policies that are requested by your delivery officer or EE</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.5 </span>Summary of main tasks</h3>

<h4>Appointing a principal designate</h4>

<p>Principal designate appointments can be made either through open national recruitment or as a direct appointment (without advertising). Given the importance of the appointment, you must fully involve your EE in any open national recruitment of the principal designate. You must also notify your delivery officer before going against advice from the EE.</p>

<p>Your EE will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work with you to provide advice on the job specification role, skills or specialisms – talking through and agreeing the job specification</li>
  <li>support you by being a panel member by reviewing and sifting applications and agreeing the final candidates to be interviewed</li>
  <li>support you by being a panel member providing advice after the sifts and interviews on the choice of candidate, influencing the recruitment approach to ensure this is fair and transparent</li>
</ul>

<p>In exceptional circumstances (such as where an experienced trust is behind the project), DfE may agree that an EE does not need to be involved. Your delivery officer will discuss this with you.</p>

<p>Direct appointments can be made where appropriate but, as an academy trust, you will need to be able to show how the appointment was transparent and fair.</p>

<p>Once you have identified a suitable candidate, DfE may suggest that they undergo a benchmarking exercise. This will involve the candidate being interviewed by your EE and having their performance assessed against relevant leadership standards. The results can then be used to inform the design of a development programme, which you can then take forward with the principal designate.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may choose to spend the money you would have spent on advertising the post to put your preferred direct appointment candidate through an assessment to make an informed judgement about their suitability. Most large educational recruitment firms and universities run assessments for school leaders.</p>

<p>NSN has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/pre-open-schools/resources" rel="external">resources</a> to help you recruit your principal designate. This includes detailed advice based on the experience of successful free schools.</p>

<p>The principal designate of a free school forming a trust with only one school will also be the accounting officer (in trusts with more than one school the accounting officer will be the CEO or senior executive leader (SEL) of the trust). The role of the accounting officer includes a personal responsibility to the ESFA’s accounting officer and to Parliament for the financial resources under the free school’s control. Further information about the role of the accounting officer can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#governance-1"> section 3</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to send a copy of the principal designate’s contract to your delivery officer when an appointment has been made. This is to ensure DfE is aware of any costs that could be incurred as a result of the principal designate’s salary being underwritten.</p>

<p>Serving headteachers and teaching staff are bound by contractual resignation dates. Appointments made before a funding agreement is in place should be conditional on you entering into the funding agreement and the school opening. You must escalate to your delivery officer if you are experiencing difficulties appointing high-quality teaching staff.</p>

<p>DfE recognise that you may be asked by a potential principal designate for additional security where a funding agreement has yet to be signed and they are being asked to hand in their resignation and accept the job at the free school. In such cases, DfE will underwrite the salary costs, plus on-costs, should the free school not open, or if its opening is deferred by a year.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>DfE will only underwrite the principal designate salary once the provisional opening date has been confirmed and we have started to release PDG beyond the initial allocation.</p>
</div>

<p>DfE will pay the principal designate’s salary plus on costs, including employer pension contributions and national insurance, for no more than 2 academic terms. This begins from, and includes the remainder of, the term the decision to cancel or defer the project is made, and the subsequent term. In cases where one clear term’s notice can be given, DfE will underwrite only one term.</p>

<p>DfE will agree a cap on the underwriting on a case-by-case basis. If required, DfE may pay the salary directly to the principal designate.</p>

<p>The principal designate’s employment contract with you must state that, if, after the free school has been cancelled or deferred, the principal designate becomes underemployed, they may be required to take on additional work for the department while their salary is being underwritten by DfE.</p>

<p>The principal designate’s employment contract must also state that, should the free school not go ahead, while still being paid by DfE they must take all reasonable steps to seek alternative employment. Furthermore, in the event that they do take up any such alternative employment, DfE will deduct the value of that remuneration from payments to them.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances DfE may agree, on a case-by-case basis, to also underwrite the salary costs plus on costs for key essential teaching staff. In considering such cases, DfE will look at the progress you are making on the project. If agreed, underwriting for other key essential teaching staff will be subject to the same conditions set out above. If you are intending to underwrite the salary of your principal designate or essential teaching staff you must speak to your delivery officer at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h4>Finalising staffing structure and recruitment</h4>

<p>You will also need to finalise your staffing structure for all staff and recruit those needed in your first year. Alongside your principal designate, you will need to consider other important posts, including senior leaders, who must be carefully budgeted for. You might find it useful to consider the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/schools-financial-efficiency-top-10-planning-checks-for-governors">top 10 planning checks for governors</a>, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/integrated-curriculum-and-financial-planning-icfp">integrated curriculum and financial planning resources</a> which provide some tools to help ensure that you are making the best use of resources when planning your staffing and curriculum. Further practical resources for school leaders and teachers to help reduce workload can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reducing-school-workload">reducing teaching workload</a>.</p>

<p>As well as teaching posts, it is important to think carefully about who will take on the finance role, to develop the more detailed budget for year one and for pre-opening and to regularly consider staffing plans against financial plans and pupils recruited. Only by doing so will you be able to demonstrate that your proposed staffing structure is affordable, both pre- and post-opening. Additionally, it is important to remember that your staffing structure and recruitment plans should not be confirmed until you have a firm idea of how many pupils you have recruited.</p>

<p>Most free schools advertise for staff in both national and local press. Some find holding their own recruitment fairs a good way of attracting staff. Others have used agencies or organisations with talent pools, but these will often charge schools for this service. Many of the major education recruitment agencies have access to pools of staff. Your EE may also be able to advise you on what you could do to attract good staff. When considering options, bear in mind the principle of effective <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-recruitment-and-retention-strategy">school resource management</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Teaching Vacancies</a> is a free, national service for searching and listing teaching roles. It is available to publicly funded schools in England. DfE developed the service to address school leaders’ concerns about the level of expenditure on teacher recruitment advertising. By using the service, schools can save money on recruitment advertising.</p>

<p>Access to Teaching Vacancies for schools in pre-opening is currently being developed and your delivery officer will let you have details of how to do this once it has been finalised.</p>

<p>Social distancing guidelines may mean it is not possible for schools to hold face-to-face recruitment processes. Interviews should either happen remotely, for example, via an online video or telephone interview, or be delayed to a later date. Schools will need to ensure that all employment laws are met and that applicants have equality of opportunity throughout the selection process. We trust schools to use their judgment in implementing this.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-dfe-approved-framework.service.gov.uk/list/supply-teachers" rel="external">supply teachers and agency workers</a> deal supports schools to reduce costs when recruiting supply teachers and other agency workers. This deal provides easy access to supply teacher agencies and shows mark-up in a wholly transparent way. As part of the deal, agencies cannot apply fees for making temporary staff permanent after 12 weeks if given 4 weeks’ notice and administration time is reduced, as rigorous background checks must have been conducted on all staff in line with our statutory guidance Keeping Children Safe in Education.</p>

<p>All serving headteachers and teaching staff will be bound by contractual resignation dates and you will need to factor this into your recruitment plans. For example, a serving headteacher will have to have accepted a post and resigned by the end of September for a January start, the end of January to take up an appointment in May, and the end of April for a September start. As it may take a few attempts to recruit a suitable principal designate, it is sensible to consider when to begin the recruitment process very carefully, factoring in that you will need confirmation of your provisional opening date first.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.6 </span>Free school freedoms for appointing staff</h3>

<p>As the employer, you are responsible for appointing staff. If you are working with an education provider, you may pass the responsibility on to them but you may still want to be involved in the recruitment process, as you will be the legal employer of all staff. As academies, free schools have some freedoms in appointing staff that other schools do not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are not bound by the national pay and conditions document and you can set your own pay and conditions – for comparative purposes national pay scales are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-teachers-pay-and-conditions">school teachers pay and conditions</a>
</li>
  <li>you are not required to employ staff with qualified teacher status (QTS), with the exception of the SEN coordinator (SENCO) and the designated lead for children in care. However, this freedom does not apply to special free schools</li>
  <li>your principal designate is not required to hold the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your free school includes nursery provision, you will need to ensure that your staff: child ratio meets the minimum requirements outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">early years foundation stage framework</a> (EYFS). Exact ratios depend on the age of the child, the level of qualification of the staff and the type of setting. Your delivery officer and EE will need to satisfy themselves that your planned staffing numbers meet these requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.7 </span>Free schools’ statutory responsibilities</h3>

<p>There are some statutory requirements on free schools with regard to staffing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the SENCO and designated lead for children in care must hold QTS</li>
  <li>as an employer, you have a statutory duty to enrol all your staff membership into either the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) or the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS), depending on whether their role is teaching or support - pension contributions must start with employment, so you should ensure that pension provisions are in place for staff taking up their post prior to the free school opening (during pre-opening))</li>
  <li>with regards to the TPS, you must comply with the TPS Regulations, including making sure those who are eligible are enrolled and also comply with the requirements of the TPS administrator, Teachers’ Pensions (TP), for example, to provide data, information, contact details and timely pension contributions – you should contact TP as early as possible for help and guidance on these issues</li>
  <li>if your school is to be a designated faith school and you wish to recruit teaching staff on the basis of faith, you will need to seek designation as a school with a religious character – you can find out more in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#religious-character">section 11</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.8 </span>TUPE (The transfer of undertaking (protection of employment))</h3>

<p>TUPE Regulations 2006 (amended 2013) (TUPE) protects employees by providing for their automatic transfer by operation of law under their existing terms and conditions when their work activities transfer from one employer to another. It only applies to employees; it does not apply to volunteers and it does not apply to agency workers (other than in respect of information and consulting obligations).</p>

<p>DfE would not usually expect TUPE to apply to a free school, if it is not replacing an existing school. Most free schools are new and additional schools; the only exception to this basic position is where existing provision (such as existing alternative provision or special schools) convert to become a free school.</p>

<p>The TUPE regulations place a statutory obligation on the employer to inform and consult prior to a transfer taking place. The employer will need to inform their employees’ representatives (the recognised union or, if there is not one, elected representatives) of certain matters in writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the fact that the transfer is to take place</li>
  <li>the date of the transfer and the reasons for it</li>
  <li>the legal, economic and social implications of the transfer for any affected employees and any measures which the employer envisages it will take in connection with the transfer, in relation to any affected employees</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no set period for the information and consultation process but it has to be long enough before a transfer, to enable the employer of any affected employees to consult the appropriate representatives. You should aim to provide the information and to start consulting as early in the process as possible. As a rough guide, DfE suggest this should be not less than 30 days before the transfer, but this is for the trust to determine.</p>

<p>If you know that staff will need to transfer, you will want to have information from the outgoing employer about the employees and any liabilities you may be taking on. The outgoing employer (the ‘transferor’) is legally obliged to notify you (the ‘transferee’) of employee liability information of any person employed who would be in scope to transfer. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the identity and age of the employee</li>
  <li>the particulars of employment for the employee</li>
  <li>any relevant information such as disciplinary procedures taken against the employee</li>
  <li>any information on court or tribunal claims that the transferor has reasonable grounds to believe may be brought after the transfer</li>
  <li>information as to any collective agreements which will have effect after the transfer that are relevant to transferring employee</li>
</ul>

<p>Even staff who are in the process of being disciplined will transfer, if in scope, and the transferee will then continue the disciplinary process to its conclusion. Staff can object to the transfer, but if they do so unreasonably, they will lose any right to claim compensation for unfair dismissal or any redundancy rights. The basic assumption is that they are expected, if they are in scope, to transfer to the new organisation. They do so with their continuity of service protected and their terms and conditions protected. After a year, it is possible to harmonise terms and conditions, but only by agreement.</p>

<p>Some matters do not transfer, such as criminal liabilities and terms in relation to pensions. Again, specific legal advice may be necessary. Determining the application of TUPE is complex because a number of factors need to be considered. Each project is different and dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Trusts should always consult their own legal advisors regarding any potential TUPE issues.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.9 </span>Developing an education brief</h3>

<p>It is good practice to put all strategies and statements together into one document, the education brief, that provides detail of how your school will operate. This can be distributed to staff and governors before opening, so that everyone in the organisation understands the vision for the new school, the way that the school will operate, the educational programme that will be delivered, the goals that the school wishes to achieve and its ambitions for the future.</p>

<p>It is important to be clear about what the essential elements that constitute a good brief are, how they may be constructed, and the audience or audiences it will be for and the purpose it has. It is also important to state how it may be put into practice and owned by the entire school, including the trust, governing body, the senior leadership team, staff and pupils and their parents. Details of what the education brief should contain are provided <a class="govuk-link" href="#_Annex_E:_What">here.</a></p>

<p>A well-developed education brief will do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform your pre-opening planning and timescales</li>
  <li>take you through your Ofsted pre-registration inspection successfully</li>
  <li>help you choose the right staff and governors, and show how you will retain them, with particular regard for developing a manageable and sustainable workload as the school expands - refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reducing-school-workload">workload reduction resources</a> which includes a helpful toolkit produced by DfE to support you</li>
  <li>help you create a whole school approach to mental health and wellbeing, and to ensuring that staff wellbeing policy is integrated within the school’s culture</li>
  <li>ensure you are effective, safe and secure and achieving from first day of opening</li>
  <li>be accessible and written in a way that you feel confident in sharing it with a wide range of audiences, internally and externally</li>
  <li>be focused on pupil outcomes from the start</li>
  <li>prepare you for your first Ofsted section 5 inspection and help you achieve a good or outstanding judgement</li>
</ul>

<p>The education brief also provides valuable evidence and reassurance to your delivery officer that you are offering a high quality and inclusive educational offer, and that the school is on track to be educationally viable. This will inform their judgement to recommend the Secretary of State to enter a funding agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.10 </span>Developing education policies</h3>

<p>You have statutory duties in terms of the policies that need to be in place before opening. DfE has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-policies-for-schools">guide for schools</a> (including free schools) about these duties. This includes details of the policies that your school must have and how frequently they must be reviewed.</p>

<p>Policies may fulfil one or more of 4 requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statutory requirement of education law or other legislation impacting on schools</li>
  <li>required prior to the funding agreement and are also a statutory requirement</li>
  <li>required for the Ofsted pre-registration inspection</li>
  <li>related to teaching and learning and may be requested during an Ofsted inspection post-opening</li>
</ul>

<p>It is imperative that policies are in place by their respective deadlines.</p>

<p>You will be required to submit some policies before your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#inspections-and-registration-as-an-independent-school">Ofsted pre-registration inspection</a> and an inspector may ask to see others on the day. There will be other detailed plans and policies you will need to have in place for your first Ofsted inspection (normally in the third year after opening). In the <a class="govuk-link" href="#projecttasklist">checklist of tasks</a>, DfE have set out what needs to be done as a minimum, and by when, in the run up to opening. The checklist is not exhaustive but will give you an idea of what may be required, and when.</p>

<p>Closing the attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils is a priority for DfE. Your education plans and policies should reflect the local context in which your school will operate and be designed to improve outcomes and enhance the life chances of children in the local community.</p>

<p>When planning your curriculum, you should ensure that this is aligned with the needs of children in the local area where your school will operate, including how you will address the specific forms of disadvantage affecting pupils. For example, if your school will be situated in an area where a high proportion of pupils speak English as an additional language, you should ensure that your approach towards literacy reflects this. You should also consider how your approach to teaching and learning will ensure the curriculum is delivered in a robust and effective manner and meet the needs of your expected intake.</p>

<p>When planning assessment monitoring and tracking processes you should pay attention to the advice for schools and governing boards in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response">making data work</a> report (published November 2018) to ensure excessive data burdens are avoided.</p>

<p>If your free school includes 16 to 19 provision, you might want to consider offering T levels. T levels are high-quality, rigorous, level 3 classroom-based technical study programmes that will sit alongside Apprenticeships within a reformed skills training system. They will support entry to skilled employment in technical occupations and progression to higher education options (including higher technical qualification, higher apprenticeships, degree apprenticeships and technical degrees).</p>

<p>The first 3 were launched in September 2020 with a small number of providers for specific occupations in 3 industries: digital production, design and development (digital industry), design, surveying and planning (construction industry), and education (education and childcare industry).levels in more occupational pathways are made available and T levels are rolled out nationally, DfE expect the majority of funding for 16 to 19-year-old students studying level 3 qualifications to be directed to T level and A level programmes. More information can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-of-t-levels/introduction-of-t-levels">introduction of T-levels</a>.</p>

<p>Many free schools and academies have also found the overarching structure of the education brief (available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">Annex E</a>) helpful, as this brings together all of the school’s strategic and detailed education plans and policies.</p>

<p>Exemplar education plans and policies are widely available. Exemplar policies are available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/pre-open-schools/resources" rel="external">pre-opening section of the NSN website.</a> You can also find them on local authority websites and from project management companies (where you are using one). You should tailor these to take account of the vision and curriculum plans for your free school.</p>

<p>Non-faith free schools, like other non-faith academies and schools, may apply for an exemption (called ‘a determination’) from providing a ‘broadly Christian’ daily act of collective worship. Broadly Christian can be replaced with an alternative daily act of collective worship that better reflects the faith background or backgrounds of the academy’s pupils. The determination lasts for 5 years. If you wish to apply for this status, please contact your delivery officer who will provide you with the relevant application pack.</p>

<p>Academies (including free schools) are required by law to publish specific information on their website. Guidance as to what must be included can be viewed at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/what-academies-free-schools-and-colleges-should-publish-online">what academies and free schools must publish online</a>. You must also ensure that you have the following documents in place prior to opening.</p>

<h4>A scheme of work</h4>

<p>This should set out details of the programme of learning, must be written for each subject, or programme or study. These are usually prepared by the subject head of department, or subject or phase co-ordinator in a primary setting.</p>

<h4>A school development plan for the opening year</h4>

<p>This is a strategic document, typically constructed by the principal designate and senior team, which sets out the main objectives that the school wishes to achieve within the first years. This includes success indicators, actions, staff responsible, timelines and costings for the opening and subsequent years.</p>

<p>You may wish to consider including an annual review of workload and wellbeing into your plans to ensure you are able to fulfil your commitment to a manageable and sustainable work-life balance for staff. An example <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-workload-reduction-toolkit#identify-workload-issues-in-your-school">review</a> is available to download as part of the DfE workload reduction toolkit and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://whatworkswellbeing.org/blog/measuring-wellbeing-in-schools-and-colleges/" rel="external">what works for wellbeing</a> offers examples on how to measure wellbeing in schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.11 </span>Promoting integration and community cohesion</h3>

<p>The government is committed to building strong integrated communities where people, whatever their background, live, work, learn and socialise together, based on shared rights, responsibilities and opportunities. Schools have a duty to promote community cohesion and integration, with a view to ensuring all children and young people are prepared to participate fully in life in modern Britain. There are a number of practical activities that you could undertake in your school to promote this, to support pupils to mix with those from different backgrounds and equip them with the skills, knowledge and confidence to contribute to the local community as active citizens. You may wish to consider these suggestions.</p>

<h4>Establishing sustained and structured linking arrangements with another school</h4>

<p>This can help to promote sustained social mixing and create meaningful relationships between pupils from different backgrounds with the aim of fostering more positive attitudes, build understanding of different communities and cultures, and break down barriers to greater integration.</p>

<p>You may find it useful to engage with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://thelinkingnetwork.org.uk/" rel="external">the linking network</a>, who can provide support and training to help you establish a meaningful and structured linking programme with a suitable school. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://connecting-classrooms.britishcouncil.org/partner-with-schools" rel="external">connecting classrooms</a> programme also provides opportunities to partner internationally with schools in different countries. Activities or initiatives to support pupils from different backgrounds to mix with each other within the school, for example sport days, arts competitions and music events that bring together pupils from across the school.</p>

<h4>Promoting British values</h4>

<p>Programmes, activities or trips aimed at promoting the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. This will help pupils to value differences, challenge prejudice, discrimination, stereotyping and intolerance of others, and understand the diversity of both the local community and wider society.</p>

<p>This can include activities within classrooms to teach these values, as part of a broad and balanced curriculum and including through the teaching of spiritual, moral, social and cultural (SMSC) education, for example, through subjects such as religious education, citizenship, personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE), and relationship and sex education (RSE), as well as activities outside of the classroom.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.12 </span>Youth politics or civic engagement</h3>

<p>This can help to get young people to think about the role they could play as active citizens in modern Britain. This should be linked to plans for lessons on and ethos around democracy, elections and political systems. Activities could include youth parliaments, school council and mock elections.</p>

<p>Active citizenship’ activities, such as volunteering opportunities in the local community, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/get-involved/take-part/national-citizen-service">national citizen service</a>, or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthemployment.org.uk/yp-article/the-role-of-youth-ambassadors/" rel="external">youth ambassador schemes,</a> to build links between pupils and the local community.</p>

<h4>Career programmes and policies</h4>

<p>These could focus on improving links between pupils and local employers and encouraging apprenticeships. Large employers often have schemes targeted specifically on broadening access to disadvantaged and more diverse groups, which you may wish to explore.</p>

<p>Different areas will face different barriers to and opportunities for promoting integration and community cohesion. You should consider the appropriateness of your approach towards promoting integration and community cohesion through your education plans and policies based on the characteristics of the local area where your school will be based.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.13 </span>Measuring pupil performance</h3>

<p>In order to demonstrate that your pupils are making progress, you will need to establish a baseline of pupils’ current levels of attainment upon entry to your school. As such, you will need to develop a system for baselining before your school opens, otherwise you won’t be able to demonstrate that your pupils have made progress. You will also need to implement a system of assessment that enables you to measure pupils’ performance and a strategy for improving this.</p>

<p>Once your school opens, it is important that you review your success measures and expectations regularly, to improve your school’s performance. This could include benchmarking your assessment data with other schools. As with your system for baselining and assessment, you should ensure that you have developed a robust plan for reviewing your school’s performance before your school opens.</p>

<p>When designing your plans for measuring pupil progress, you should ensure that they consider how you will approach the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the learning needs of your disadvantaged pupils and inform approaches for tackling the individual issues faced</li>
  <li>use appropriate and proportionate data to inform teaching and drive progression and attainment for all pupils - you should refer to the recommendations of DfE’s report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response">making data work</a> to support you in this</li>
  <li>monitor and evaluate whether your approaches for disadvantaged pupils are working</li>
  <li>focus on measuring and improving quality of teaching in the classroom</li>
  <li>involve parents and report progress to them</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.14 </span>Safeguarding</h3>

<p>Schools and their staff form part of the wider safeguarding system for children. Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is everyone’s responsibility. School staff are particularly important, as they are in a position to identify concerns early and provide help for children to prevent concerns escalating.</p>

<p>It is vitally important that as an academy trust you fully understand your responsibilities for safeguarding the children in your care. You should consult DfE’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">keeping children safe in education (KCSIE)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">working together to safeguard children</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-if-youre-worried-a-child-is-being-abused--2">what to do if you’re worried a child is being abused: advice for practitioners</a> guidance documents. All governing bodies must have regard to this guidance, that means they should comply with it unless there is good reason not to. When the school opens, DfE would expect it to be meeting the requirements as set out in KCSIE.</p>

<p>Every school must have a single central record (SCR) (for example, in an excel spreadsheet, along with documentation in personnel files). This should record in one central place specific information on every adult employed by the trust or coming into regular contact with children on a voluntary basis. This is a statutory requirement. A senior administrator or gatekeeper should maintain the SCR. The SCR must include for each adult employee, governor or volunteer whether the following checks have been carried out or certificated obtained, and the date on which each check was completed or a certificate obtained:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an identity check</li>
  <li>a barred list check</li>
  <li>an enhanced DBS check or certificate</li>
  <li>a prohibition from teaching check</li>
  <li>further check on people living and working outside the UK</li>
  <li>a check of professional qualifications</li>
  <li>a check to establish the person’s right to work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also find more information about what Ofsted will expect to see in place when you are inspected in their guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills</a>. This includes specific references to the SCR. There are serious implications if a school fails to provide a complete an up-to-date SCR when requested. The school can be closed immediately if the SCR is not produced, and staff can be sent home if it is incomplete. The safeguarding checklist  in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">Annex F</a> summarises these requirements and is a useful aide to keep on top of what needs to be in place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.15 </span>External experts (EEs)</h3>

<p>EEs are contracted by DfE to provide expert educational advice. Access to an EE will only be through your delivery officer.</p>

<p>You will need to have your own educational expertise in place to support you as a trust. As a minimum the EE contracted by DfE will usually do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attend and contribute to the kick-off meeting</li>
  <li>be involved in the process of appointing the principal designate</li>
  <li>be involved in the process of appointing the chair of governors (unless already appointed) and comment on the quality of the governance plans</li>
  <li>comment on the build-up of the senior staffing structure</li>
  <li>comment on the quality of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">education brief</a> (available in Annex E) and education policies, in particular safeguarding and assessment</li>
  <li>attend and contribute to the readiness to open meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a differentiated approach to DfE’s support across free school projects. The EE will be contracted to provide the support on a needs basis. The factors DfE will take into account in determining the level of EE support include the experience within your group and the complexity of your vision for the school. For example, if your educational expertise is limited, or the group has not set up a new school before, DfE may contract additional EE support.</p>

<p>The level of EE support may also change during the pre-opening period. For example, if a project has significant difficulty recruiting a principal designate, the level of support may increase.</p>

<p>After opening, an EE will be contracted to provide professional advice and challenge, via your delivery officer, to ensure that your school is delivering a high standard of education to your pupils. An EE may be contracted to undertake first, fourth and sixth term visits to your school, reporting to DfE on your progress until your first Ofsted inspection. You should ensure you check the Ofsted website regularly to keep up-to-date with any changes to the inspection framework.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Funding agreement</h2>

<p>The funding agreement is the legally binding contract between the trust and the Secretary of State, which contains the terms and conditions upon which a free school is funded.</p>

<p>Entering into a funding agreement is an important decision for both parties so requires careful consideration. Your regional schools commissioner (RSC) will need to be sure that your trust is ready to enter into the agreement and is likely to establish and maintain a popular and successful school.</p>

<p>The contract sets out what the trust needs to do. This includes, for example, a requirement for admissions to be consistent with relevant admissions law. The trust must meet these (and other) requirements in order to receive funding. The funding agreement also sets out the circumstances in which a funding agreement can be terminated.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State will consider signing a funding agreement only if you are able to develop your plans to the required standard during the pre-opening phase. For mainstream (primary, secondary and all-through) schools, the ideal is to enter into a funding agreement at least one month before the relevant national admissions offer day in the year in which the school is due to open, to give parents receiving offers the confidence that the school will open that year.</p>

<p>However, the Secretary of State will not enter into a funding agreement until they are confident, on the basis of advice from the relevant RSC, that the school will be good, viable, sustainable and successful, able to open on its proposed date, sufficiently secure about its permanent site, and that any conditions set during pre-opening or following assessment have been met. The Secretary of State can cancel or defer a project at any point during the pre-opening phase, even after your funding agreement has been signed, if your anticipated pupil numbers are not at a previously agreed level or if they consider that the school would provide an unacceptably low standard of education.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State does not enter into a funding agreement in respect of a nursery which is part of a free school, because nurseries receive their revenue funding from the local authority or fees charged to parents for provision above the ‘free’ entitlement. However, provisions around the use of the land for the nursery may need to be included in the funding agreement. Further information on nursery revenue funding arrangements is included in <a class="govuk-link" href="#funding-for-free-school-nurseries">funding for free school nurseries</a>.</p>

<p>The funding agreement checklist, available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide">Annex A</a>, sets out a non-exclusive list of the main tasks you will need to complete in order to begin the process of agreeing the funding agreement for your school.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>Why DfE uses model funding agreements</h3>

<p>DfE produces model funding agreements for all types of academy, including free schools. There are different models available to reflect the requirements of different types of free school at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-and-free-school-funding-agreements-multi-academy-trust">academy and free school funding arrangements</a>. Using model funding agreements helps DfE ensure consistency across free schools.</p>

<p>The terms of the model funding agreement have been developed since the beginning of the free schools programme. The Secretary of State has agreed these terms and is not willing to negotiate different terms for individual projects. The only acceptable variations between different funding agreements are those clauses that reflect the specific circumstances of that school, such as land arrangements, planned capacity of the school, faith/non-faith provision and arrangements for free schools with predecessor schools. The model funding agreement makes clear where these variations will be made and your delivery officer will tailor them accordingly before sending the document to you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>When you should begin the process for entering into a funding agreement</h3>

<p>The timing for entering into a funding agreement will vary depending on the project. Your delivery officer will decide the appropriate time for your project. Funding agreements are usually signed when a project has achieved all its main milestones and the delivery officer judges that the schools is likely to be good and viable upon opening.</p>

<p>There are a small number of circumstances in which DfE might consider entering into a funding agreement before all these main milestones are completed. The most common circumstances are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when entering into a build contract for a permanent site</li>
  <li>to enable schools to enter local authority co-ordinated admissions</li>
</ul>

<p>DfE aim to have all funding agreements in place by the following dates in the year when your school will open, although this will depend on whether the project has achieved its main milestones and is on course to be good and viable upon opening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for mainstream schools, one month ahead of national offer day (1 February for secondary schools and 15 March for primary schools)</li>
  <li>for special schools, in sufficient time to enable the school to be listed on a child’s EHC plan, which local authorities need to review by no later than 15 February if the school is opening in September or one term before they open if they are opening in a month other than September</li>
  <li>for AP schools, one term before they open (by mid-April for September openers)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your delivery officer will normally want to arrange a formal checkpoint meeting with your trust to ensure that everything is in place to enable the Secretary of State to sign the funding agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span>Statutory duties</h3>

<p>Before either party can begin the process of signing the funding agreement, there are certain statutory duties that must first be fulfilled by both parties.</p>

<p>The trust must consult under Section 10 of the Academies Act 2010 – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#religious-character">section 11</a> for full details. The trust must also have due regard to Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>Section 9 of the Academies Act 2010 requires the Secretary of State to complete an assessment of the impact the opening of the free school would have on maintained schools, academies, institutions within the further education sector and alternative provision in the area. The Secretary of State is also required under Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 to have due regard to needs of the PSED in the opening of the free school before the funding agreement can be signed. These processes will be undertaken by your delivery officer.</p>

<p>In addition to the completion of statutory duties, the Secretary of State will want to be satisfied that the school will be popular and successful upon opening. In making this decision, the Secretary of State will consider the following criteria:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Whether the school will deliver a good or outstanding education, according to the Ofsted criteria. Have enough high-quality teachers been appointed or are they likely to be appointed by the time the school opens? Is the school’s leadership strong? Are all the school’s policies in place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the school has recruited enough pupils to be financially viable; will it be full by the time all year groups will be present?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the admission arrangements for the school are compliant with the School admissions code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the board of trustees will be capable and effective. Does the proposed board include trustees with appropriate educational, financial and business experience or expertise? Are there arrangements in place to manage conflicts of interest?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the school will open on an appropriate, value for money site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the school is financially viable and efficient in its use of resources to promote pupil outcomes. The recruitment of pupils and an appropriate staffing structure are crucial for ensuring financial plans are affordable. Can the school cope with reasonable levels of change to its income and expenditure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the school’s plans for promoting community cohesion are appropriate and likely to be effective for the local context where the school will be based.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span>How to enter into a funding agreement: process and people involved</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>DfE sends the trust a signature-ready version of the relevant model funding agreement tailored to school’s specific circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust consults their lawyers (as necessary) on land specific clauses. All other clauses are non-negotiable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DfE provides advice to the Secretary of State on whether to enter into a funding agreement with the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust confirms with DfE that they are ready to sign the funding agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DfE communicates the Secretary of State’s decision to the trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trust prints and signs (but does not date) a hard copy (with each Annex attached to it) and sends it DfE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the funding agreement is approved, DfE arranges for it to be signed, sealed and dated and sends a hard copy back to the trust.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Secretary of State will not negotiate terms for individual projects and will not accept amendments to the model funding agreement.</p>

<p>To ensure the funding agreement is executed correctly, trusts must arrange for 2 trustees to sign the copy (or one trustee and a witness). In addition, trusts should leave the document undated when they send it to their delivery officer – DfE will date the document at the point it is signed and sealed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span>Duration</h3>

<p>The timings for the process will vary, depending on individual projects. However, the stage that most often holds up the process is agreeing the final version of the funding agreement. It is for that reason that DfE asks trusts to focus only on the school-specific clauses (as highlighted by your delivery officer). DfE cannot guarantee that the trust will get their signed funding agreement on the timescale agreed if we are not confident that the proposed school will be successful.</p>

<p>To speed up the process, you should discuss with your delivery officer, at an early stage in the pre-opening phase, your preferred timings for signing the funding agreement, which may include being in line with the local authority admissions process. While DfE cannot guarantee that this will always happen, agreeing a timescale helps to focus both the trust and the delivery officer on ensuring they have completed the necessary tasks in advance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.6 </span>Arrangements for trusts with more than one school</h3>

<p>Trusts with more than one school require different funding agreements to trusts with only one school. While a s trusts with only one school will have one funding agreement for its single free school, trusts with more than one school require a master funding agreement to cover all schools within the trust, alongside supplemental funding agreements for each individual school. Model funding agreements (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-and-free-school-funding-agreements-single-academy-trust">single</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-and-free-school-multi-model-master-funding-agreement">master</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-and-free-school-funding-agreements-multi-academy-trust">supplemental</a>) are available for mainstream, special, 16 to19 and alternative provision free schools on the gov.uk website. The master funding agreement contains general clauses (such as freedom to set the duration of the school day and year) whereas the supplemental agreement covers those clauses which are specific to the individual school.</p>

<p>If you are an existing trust looking to open a new free school, the models for trusts with more than one school (master and supplemental) will apply to you. Your delivery officer will be able to advise on which model will need to be used.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Inspections and registration as an independent school</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>This chapter summarises the process whereby proposed free schools are formally registered as independent schools based on advice from Ofsted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>Your free school must undergo an Ofsted pre-registration inspection and be registered on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get information about schools</a> (GIAS), DfE’s formal register of schools, before it can legally open.</p>

<p>16 to 19 free schools are not legally independent schools, but it has been agreed with Ofsted that they will undergo the equivalent of a pre-registration inspection to ensure parity of accountability for all free schools.</p>

<p>Once open, your free school will have more freedoms and flexibilities than other state-funded schools but it will be held accountable in exactly the same way and subject to the same Ofsted inspection regime.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Risks</h3>

<p>You must keep to the deadlines set out in this document or provided by your delivery officer if your school is to open on time. If in doubt, please speak to your delivery officer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span>Why you need an Ofsted pre-registration inspection</h3>

<p>In order to be added to GIAS and legally allowed to open, the Secretary of State must decide whether or not your free school, when open, is likely to meet the relevant independent schools standards outlined below. Guidance on the standards is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools">independent schools standards guidance</a>. The Ofsted pre-registration inspection informs this decision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>part 2: spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development of pupils</li>
  <li>part 3: welfare, health and safety of pupils</li>
  <li>part 4: suitability of the proprietor and staff</li>
  <li>part 5: premises and accommodation</li>
  <li>part 6: provision of information for parents, carers and others</li>
  <li>part 7: procedures for handling complaints</li>
  <li>part 8: leadership and management</li>
</ul>

<p>Part 1 of the regulations (quality of education) does not apply to free schools in pre-opening. Your education plans and policies will be considered throughout the pre-opening phase and in particular during your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#the-readiness-to-open-meeting-rom">readiness to open meeting</a> with DfE.</p>

<p>The pre-registration inspection is not like a full inspection, which you will be subject to once open. Instead, it seeks to establish whether the proposed school is fit to open as measured against the standards outlined above.</p>

<p>The full regulations are available at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3283/contents/made" rel="external">The Education (independent school standards) Regulations 2014.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.5 </span>Registering a nursery with Ofsted</h3>

<p>In the following circumstances a nursery does not need to be registered separately with Ofsted and will be inspected as part of the free school’s pre-registration inspection, in the following circumstances if it is provided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the school, is contained within the school’s age range, and is for children aged 2 years or older[^2], as it will be covered by the free school’s own registration</li>
  <li>a subsidiary company that is completely owned and controlled by the free school</li>
</ul>

<p>If the nursery is run by a subsidiary company that is independent from the free school, or if the free school does not exercise a high level of control over it, it is likely that the subsidiary company will need to register the childcare separately. Your delivery officer will advise you if this is the case.</p>

<p>Where separate registration is necessary, Ofsted will conduct a number of background checks and a separate pre-registration visit. Following this, it will be inspected under the arrangements set out in Ofsted’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-inspection-handbook-from-september-2015">early years inspection handbook</a>. Ofsted will also register the nursery provision on the Early Years Register and Childcare Register.</p>

<p>Further detail on registering a nursery is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/factsheet-childcare-registering-school-based-provision">Ofsted guidance on registering school-based childcare provision.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.6 </span>Timing of pre-registration inspections</h3>

<p>Your delivery officer will discuss with you when your inspection should happen. Your Ofsted inspector will then contact you directly to confirm the date of inspection. You will be given notice of when your inspection will take place and you will be expected to make yourselves available on that date.</p>

<p>Inspections, for free schools opening in September, will take place in May and June. For free schools opening at other times during the year, inspections will usually take place in the term prior to opening.</p>

<p>Free schools that have made the most progress towards opening will be prioritised for early inspection, while those that would benefit from having more time before their inspection will be scheduled later. It may seem advantageous to have the inspection as late as possible to give yourselves the greatest possible time to prepare. However, having an early inspection gives you more time to put right any issues identified by Ofsted before your opening day.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.7 </span>What you need to do ahead of the inspection</h3>

<p>You will need to provide the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a plan showing the layout of the premises and accommodation of all buildings</li>
  <li>a copy of the school’s written policies on
    <ul>
      <li>preventing bullying - changes to the independent school standards in 2013 mean that it is no longer prescribed that bullying policies must take into account DfE guidance ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preventing-and-tackling-bullying">preventing and tackling bullying</a>’, however, you may still find it useful to consider the advice</li>
      <li>safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children who are pupils at the school (this should be compliant with the relevant health and safety law)</li>
      <li>safeguarding and promoting the health and safety of pupils on activities outside the school which has regard to DfE’s guidance – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-advice-for-schools">health and safety: advice for schools</a>
</li>
      <li>promoting good behaviour amongst pupils setting out the sanctions to be adopted in the event of pupil misbehaviour</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a copy of the school complaints procedures, as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3283/made#f00017" rel="external">Part 7 of the Education (independent school standards) (England) Regulations 2014</a>
</li>
  <li>evidence that the school has appropriate procedures in place for undertaking Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks of staff and recording the results - all schools should have a single central register to record this information. Before registration can take place, as a minimum, the chair of trustees must hold a valid DBS certificate, countersigned by DfE (DBS checks on all trustees and other members should be well underway, if not completed, ahead of registration. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-pre-opening-guide/free-school-pre-opening-guide#due-diligence">Section 4</a> contains more information)</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You will need to provide these documents directly to Ofsted. Ofsted will provide information on how to do this when they advise you of your inspection date.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you do not submit the necessary documentation in time, your inspection may be delayed.</p>
</div>

<p>Ofsted will contact you directly to advise you of the inspection date and give 5 working days’ notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.8 </span>Compliance with the regulatory reform (fire safety) order</h3>

<p>You will need to be able to demonstrate to Ofsted that your school is meeting the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a>. Trusts should ensure that they comply with the fire safety order and registration will not be agreed until confirmation of satisfactory fire precautions is received.</p>

<p>You will need to inform the local Fire and Rescue Service ahead of opening, although the fire service may decide not to inspect the premises immediately. Note that the fire service is not under any obligation to provide this service before the school opens, though many will to do so. Ofsted will consider alternative evidence such as written confirmation from the Fire and Rescue Service that they have approved your fire risk assessment in principle or one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation/certificate issued by an independent fire safety advisor</li>
  <li>confirmation that you have a fire risk assessment and are complying with the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</li>
  <li>a completion certificate confirming construction is in accordance with Building Control Regulations and in compliance with fire safety standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.9 </span>The day of the inspection</h3>

<p>The inspector will usually spend half a day with your school and will normally need to be met and escorted by the principal designate or the lead proposer. They may also need access to some office space in order to work. While in most cases it is the principal designate who talks to the inspector, it does not have to be. As long as someone else in the group can talk through the policies and plans, the principal designate does not have to be there. Ofsted will not rearrange the date of the inspection simply because the principal designate is unavailable.</p>

<p>In order to make a judgement about each of the standards, the inspector may ask to see other policies on the day. If for any reason a particular document is not available, whomever is meeting the inspector needs to be able to discuss the plans for its development. Similarly, if the work on the site is not completed, you will need to be prepared to talk to the inspector about how the building will develop. If site works are still underway and it is possible for the inspector to be shown around that would be desirable but not necessary. The building work does not need to be completed ahead of the inspection but the inspector will need to see evidence that all the requirements of part 5 of the standards, relating to the premises and accommodation of the school, are being considered and will be met by the time the school opens.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.10 </span>After the inspection</h3>

<p>After the inspection, the inspector will produce an advice note and a checklist.</p>

<p>In the event that the Ofsted feedback indicates that there are issues that must be addressed, known as ‘conditions of registration’, you must take action to resolve these before the school can open. Your delivery officer will be in touch to make sure that the conditions have been met and that you have evidence to demonstrate this. Your delivery officer will work with you urgently to address the issues and if necessary, will arrange for the school to have a re-inspection. After the re-inspection, the inspector will produce a second advice note and checklist.</p>

<p>DfE needs to be certain whether any conditions have been met. Only then can your registration on GIAS be completed.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you are not registered on GIAS, you cannot legally open.</p>
</div>

<p>Ofsted is responsible for publishing the advice notices. Publication usually takes place in the term your free school opens. If you are interested in seeing what an advice notice looks like, you can view <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-registration-advice-notes-for-free-schools-studio-schools-and-university-technical-colleges-2019">previously published advice notices.</a></p>

<p>You should be careful about how you communicate the outcome of your inspection to your local community. These inspections are about whether or not the school is fit to open rather than providing any judgement of quality. For example, it would be misleading to say that Ofsted have visited and said that you are ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ just because you have no conditions to satisfy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.11 </span>Get information about schools registration</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get information about schools</a> (GIAS) is DfE’s database of all educational establishments in England and Wales. Being entered on GIAS automatically generates your free school its DfE number and unique reference number (URN), which are used in a variety of circumstances to formally identify the school.</p>

<p>Your delivery officer will provide you with a GIAS form which you must complete and return to them.</p>

<p>Once the form has been processed, you will be issued with your URN and DfE number. Your school is initially entered as ‘pending approval’, which means that the school is not yet fully registered and is not publicly visible or searchable.</p>

<p>Your school will not be publicly searchable until your school’s status is changed to ‘proposed to open’ and registration is complete. This will happen when you have a funding agreement in place, any pre-opening ROM actions have been addressed and you have successfully completed your Ofsted pre-registration inspection.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.12 </span>DfE Sign-in</h3>

<p>DfE Sign-in is DfE’s portal for systems such as COLLECT (collections online for learning, education, children and teachers) which is used by schools, local authorities and DfE for processing data collection returns, school to school, key to success, ESFA-managed information exchange and GIAS. Access to systems is granted on a user-by-user basis and only those systems that a user has permission to access will be displayed. Not all systems will be available until your free school is open.</p>

<p>Around 2 months before your free school is due to open, your delivery officer will be in touch with you to obtain the details of the person you want to be given the initial access to DfE Sign-In.</p>

<p>Initial approver access will be given to the person you nominate. They will receive their DfE Sign-in details once you have successfully completed an Ofsted pre-registration inspection and your free school’s status has been changed to ‘proposed to open’ on GIAS.</p>

<p>Academies (including free schools) and trust accounts can have up to 20 user accounts and 2 approver accounts per organisation.</p>

<p>The approver can create accounts for other members of staff and add services to accounts such as COLLECT. They also archive accounts when they are no longer in use. It is their responsibility and decision as to who they add to the account.</p>

<p>Once registration is complete, it is important that someone at your school takes responsibility for keeping your GIAS record accurate and up-to-date. DfE will not do this for you. If you do not confirm your school information on GIAS is correct every 60 days, you will get a reminder that you need to review and update your details. This will continue to be issued weekly until you review and confirm details.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.13 </span>Inspections once open</h3>

<p>Once open, mainstream, alternative provision and special free schools are inspected under the same arrangements as maintained schools. Sixteen to 19 free schools are inspected under the same arrangements that apply to other post-16 providers. The first full inspection of a free school normally takes place during the third year of opening (for schools with boarding provision, this will be the first year).</p>

<p>From September 2019, Ofsted refocused inspections of schools, early years settings and further education and skills providers, to make sure that learners are receiving a high-quality education that puts them on a path to future success.</p>

<p>Ofsted inspectors will spend less time looking at exam results and test data, and more time considering how a nursery, school, college or other education provider has achieved their results. That is, whether they are the outcome of a broad, rich curriculum and real learning, or of teaching to the test and exam cramming. Further information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted">Ofsted’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Many open free schools have found it useful to buy in support to undertake a trial run inspection ahead of their first Ofsted inspection to identify any outstanding issues. Many providers offer this service and employ ex-HMIs to deliver it. These external assurance exercises will help validate your school’s self-evaluations and inform school improvement plans ahead of your first Ofsted inspection.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.14 </span>School-to-school support</h3>

<p>One of the most effective ways of achieving school improvement is by working with other schools. There are now many opportunities for school leaders and governors to work with and receive support from their peers. Further information can be found in the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-access-school-to-school-support">‘Teaching schools and system leaders: get support for you and your school’</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>The readiness-to-open meeting (ROM)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>You may be invited to a readiness-to-open meeting to confirm that all necessary plans are in place and ready for your school to open. This section summarises the process of preparing for and successfully managing the meeting in the run-up to opening your school. ROMs may be held face-to-face or via Microsoft Teams. In a small number of cases your ROM may be paper based or it might be felt it is not necessary to hold one at all. Your delivery officer will advise.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>ROMs will normally take place before the end of June ahead of opening in September. ROMs are formal meetings between DfE and the trust designed to achieve the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify issues and risks that might prevent the school from being financially and educationally viable on opening</li>
  <li>assess whether the school’s plans for promoting integration and community cohesion are appropriate and likely to be effective for the local context where the school will be based</li>
  <li>identify actions needed to mitigate risks or address issues</li>
  <li>where necessary, enable ministers to take decisive action (such as to defer) before the opening date</li>
</ul>

<p>Education and viability will be the main focus of the ROM. DfE will use the meeting to make a judgement on how confident it is that the proposer group will open a successful school.</p>

<p>Attendees from the proposer group should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the chair of trustees (DfE suggest both the local governing chair and the chair of the board from the trust should attend where appropriate)</li>
  <li>the principal designate (head of school or the executive head may also attend where appropriate)</li>
  <li>any other person who can provide information useful to the meeting, for example the chair of finance committee, or business manager</li>
  <li>only those who hold a governance or leadership role should attend, with a maximum of 5 proposer group attendees overall</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">16.3 </span>Summary of tasks</h3>

<p>The principal designate will be required to complete a risk report and return it to the delivery officer at least 2 weeks prior to the ROM. The report will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>underline any risks or issues and the actions needed to address those issues</li>
  <li>identify areas that require further discussion</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>Risks</h3>

<p>Those attending from the proposer group must include the chair of governors (both the local governor chair and trust chair should attend where appropriate) and the principal designate (the executive head can also attend where appropriate).</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>DfE will postpone the meeting unless both the chair of governors and the principal designate are able to attend, or if the information we need is returned too late for us to review before the meeting.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span>Working with DfE</h3>

<p>Your delivery officer will discuss the format and aims of the ROM with you in advance of the meeting. There will also be an opportunity to consider the content of the risk report to be completed by the principal designate.</p>

<p>The ROM will be chaired by a seniorDfE official and will be attended by your delivery officer and, where appropriate, representative or representatives from ESFA. DfE will also ask an external expert to attend. DfE representatives will ask questions about progress, risks and issues in main areas of the project and agree with you what actions might be needed for each relevant issue.</p>

<span class="number">17. </span>Once your school is open</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span>The final stage of the pre-opening period</h3>

<p>The final stage of the pre-opening phase is to prepare for opening, which includes the moving of your free school project to the EFSA link officer who will be the main point of contact for the school on matters relating to finance and governance, and the FSC project director if you are in temporary accommodation or there is still capital work needed on the permanent site.</p>

<p>Once your school opens, you may be allocated a new delivery officer who will have responsibility for monitoring your educational performance</p>

<p>Your delivery officer will ensure that the FSC project director and ESFA are fully briefed on your project so they know what challenges you may experience in your early days of opening.</p>

<p>The expectation is that once your school is open, you have the freedom, autonomy and responsibility to run it, within the expectations and requirements set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a> and your funding agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span>What ESFA does</h3>

<p>ESFA is an executive agency of DfE. The role of ESFA is to provide revenue funding and is accountable to Parliament for how funds are used, ensuring the regularity, propriety and value for money of expenditure. To do this, ESFA must be satisfied that academy trusts have appropriate arrangements for sound governance, financial management, value for money and accounting, and that trusts’ use of public funds is consistent with the purposes voted by Parliament.</p>

<p>ESFA expects free schools to make the most effective use of their financial freedoms to raise educational standards, operating full accountability for how they spend tax-payers’ money. Schools are asked to provide financial returns so ESFA can provide assurance that this is the case and that free schools are meeting the terms of their funding agreements.</p>

<p>ESFA supports a free school’s compliance with its funding agreement by responding to any requests that you may make of the Secretary of State as required by the funding agreement. This may include things such as approval to enter into a lease or to dispose of land.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span>How ESFA will work with you</h3>

<p>ESFA has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-for-newly-opened-academies-academy-trusts-and-free-schools">guide for newly opened academies, academy trusts and free schools</a> to introduce you to our areas of work and guide you through the first few months on matters relating to funding, funding agreement compliance, finance and financial assurance.</p>

<p>The GOV.UK website has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/education-and-skills-funding-agency">information about ESFA</a> for all ESFA customers and a specific area for academies and free schools funding, payments and compliance.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a> sets out the responsibilities and requirements relating to academy trusts’ financial governance and management. Compliance with the academies financial handbook  is a condition of your funding agreement.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/skills-funding-agency-update">ESFA update</a> is a weekly email bulletin. Articles are brief and focus on important updates and main actions for you.</p>

<p>ESFA aim to provide clear and comprehensive information about all of their areas of work. If there’s anything you don’t understand, or you need clarification on a specific issue relating to your individual academy or academy trust, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/fillform.php?self=1&amp;form_id=HR41uA2F8Dh&amp;type=form&amp;ShowMsg=1&amp;form_name=Knowledge+centre+enquiry+form&amp;noRegister=false&amp;ret=%2Fmodule%2Fservices&amp;noLoginPrompt=1" rel="external">enquiry service</a> will be able to help or point you in the right direction.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span>Regional schools commissioners (RSC)</h3>

<p>As the number of academies and free schools continues to grow, DfE have considered how the system should respond, to ensure that decisions about the academy school system (including free schools) should be taken closer to the areas concerned, and that education leaders should have a stronger influence on those decisions. The best people to do this are outstanding leaders and heads in each region. Local heads know their areas best and know what is right for academies and free schools locally.</p>

<p>There are 8 regional schools commissioners (RSCs) across eight regions of the country. The RSCs report to the national schools commissioner.</p>

<p>The RSCs and their regions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/sue-baldwin">Sue Baldwin: East of England and North-East London</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/john-edwards--2">Carol Gray: East Midlands and the Humber</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/vicky-beer">Vicky Beer: Lancashire and West Yorkshire</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/katherine-cowell">Katherine Cowell: North of England</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/claire-burton--2">Claire Burton: South-East England and South London</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/hannah-woodhouse">Hannah Woodhouse: South-West England</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/andrew-warren">Andrew Warren: West Midlands</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/headteacher-boards">headteacher board (HTB)</a> of 6 to 8 elected, appointed and co-opted members advises each RSC. HTBs are responsible for advising and challenging RSCs on academy-related issues. HTB members are academy headteachers and professional leaders.</p>

<p>RSCs take decisions regarding academies and free schools in their regions in the name of the Secretary of State. All decisions are taken in line with the legislation and our published criteria. Further information on RSCs can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/schools-commissioners-group/about">RSC website</a>.</p>

<p>RSCs’ general responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taking action where academies, free schools, university technical colleges or studio schools are underperforming</li>
  <li>intervening in academies where governance is inadequate</li>
  <li>deciding on applications from local-authority-maintained schools to convert to academy status</li>
  <li>improving underperforming maintained schools by providing them with support from a strong sponsor</li>
  <li>encouraging and deciding on applications from sponsors to operate in a region</li>
  <li>taking action to improve poorly performing sponsors</li>
  <li>advising on proposals for new free schools</li>
  <li>advising on whether to cancel, defer or enter into funding agreements with free school projects</li>
  <li>deciding on applications to make <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-significant-changes-to-an-existing-academy">significant changes to academies, free schools</a>, university technical colleges and studio schools</li>
</ul>

<p>RSCs’ main responsibilities in relation to free schools are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advising ministers on which free school applications (including mainstream, 16 to 19, special and alternative provision) to approve</li>
  <li>advising ministers on whether to cancel, defer or enter into funding agreements with free school projects in pre-opening</li>
  <li>tackling educational underperformance in open free schools, UTCs and studio schools</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.5 </span>Important tasks in the early days of opening</h3>

<p>You’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prepare for an external expert visit in your first term of opening</li>
  <li>ensure that the academy trust has approved an annual budget for the first year of operation and submitted this to ESFA in accordance with the published timetable</li>
  <li>ensure that the academy trust has implemented the requirements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">academies financial handbook</a>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Freedom of Information (FoI)</h2>

<p>Free schools are subject to Freedom of Information (FoI) requests as trusts are public authorities under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/what-is-the-foi-act/" rel="external">Freedom of Information Act (2000)</a> (the ‘Act’) in their own right. The Act provides a right of access to any recorded information held by public authorities. It does this in 2 ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public authorities are obliged to publish certain information about their activities</li>
  <li>members of the public are entitled to request information from public authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>If the information in scope of the request is about or details an impact on the environment, such as new school buildings or the change of use of land, then the request will need to be handled under Environmental Information Regulations (EIR). Guidance on this can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/" rel="external">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> website.</p>

<p>The Act does not give people access to their own personal data (information about themselves) such as their health records or credit reference file. If a member of the public wants to see information that a public authority holds about them, they should make a subject access request to the organisation that holds the data under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-protection-act-2018">Data Protection Act 2018</a>. However, if you receive an FoI request where the information asked for is the requester’s personal data, you should inform the requester that the information is exempt under the FoI Act, but at the same time deal with it as a subject access request under the Data Protection Act.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>Summary of the important tasks</h3>

<p>DfE cannot advise free schools on how to answer an FoI request. However, if you receive a request and are unsure how to deal with it, you should ask your delivery officer, in the first instance, as they may be able to help you understand what is being asked of you and can point you in the direction of useful resources.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>Other sources of information</h3>

<p>It may be helpful, when considering how best to answer an FoI request, to look at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/" rel="external">Information Commissioner’s Office website</a>. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is overseen by the Information Commissioner’s Office (the independent body with responsibility for the regulation of the Act, EIR and the Data Protection Act). If you receive requests for information that is already publicly available, you should direct the requester to where the information is published.</p>
