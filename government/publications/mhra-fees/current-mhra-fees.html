<p>Notes:
This fee will be payable on application for a Review Panel hearing and applies to all Review Panel proceedings related to an applicant who disagrees with a decision of the licensing authority and who has made an application to be heard pursuant to the relevant sections of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and subordinate legislation. A fee will be payable in respect of requests for hearings relating to marketing authorisations, manufacturer’s licences and authorisations, clinical trials applications, herbal and homeopathic registration and blood establishments and blood banks.</p>

<p>If the outcome of the hearing is positive for the company and the original advice is overturned, the fee will be refunded. If an application is made and subsequently withdrawn before a panel has been appointed to consider the case, a partial refund (60%) will be made. If the application is withdrawn after the panel has been appointed, no refund will be applicable</p>

<p>Before applying for an office-based risk assessment, please read the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Minimum fee of one day (with the exception of the GDP inspections)</li>
  <li>Inspection daily rate is calculated against a standard 7 hour working day (excluding lunch breaks). Number of days spent on site for fees purposes will be calculated by dividing the number of hours on site by 7. Additional part days of less than 3.5 hours will be charged at half the daily rate and part days in excess of 3.5 hours will be charged at the full daily rate.</li>
  <li>Daily rate fee includes pre-inspection preparation, travelling time, reporting of inspections and resolving issues. It also incorporates activities such as evaluation of compliance assessment report and other support functions and directly related overheads.</li>
  <li>A reduced rate fee for a wholesale dealer inspection will be payable by wholesale dealers who handle GSL products only and for registered retail pharmacies and small wholesale dealers where wholesaling of licensed products does not exceed 15% or £35,000 of total turnover ONLY where an inspector spends less than 3.5 hours on site. This fee will be £1,328.</li>
  <li>For inspections where two (or more) fully qualified inspectors undertake the inspection, the time on site for fees purposes will be the aggregated time for both inspectors.</li>
  <li>For inspections attended by two or more inspectors, one or more of who is in training, only the cost of one inspector will be charged. The status of the inspectors will be made clear to the company at the start of the inspection.</li>
  <li>The office based risk assessment fee will be charged where a risk assessment is conducted which does not lead to an inspection</li>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where the application:
    <ul>
      <li>relates to a medicinal product which, at the time the marketing authorisation was granted, contained a new active ingredient; and</li>
      <li>is the first renewal in relation to that product.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a number of such renewal applications are made at the same time and in relation to products with the same active ingredient, dosage form, indications, Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) and renewal date, the full fee is charged for the first application, but a fee of £747 will be payable in respect of each of the other applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the Agency is of the view that a major reclassification application does not require consideration by a medicines advisory committee a 50% reduction of the fee applies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If multiple MA applications with reclassification elements are made at the same time and in relation to products with the same active ingredient, the full additional fee is charged for one application but only £734 for each other application. If multiple reclassification variation applications are made at the same time and in relation to products with the same active ingredient, the full fee is charged for the one application but in relation to each other application the fee is only £734, or £367 for PLPI variations in the case of other applications where there is an analogous product already with the same legal status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all label and leaflet applications, a bulk “discount” applies where a number of simultaneous applications are made for identical changes covering a range of strengths of the same dosage form. The first application is charged at the full rate shown and second and subsequent applications are charged at 50%.</p>

<p>Notes:
1. Reductions for ‘bulks’ of single or group variations (ie same changes different authorisations belonging to the same company) are available. Further guidance for bulk variations is available at the end of this page</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard fees will be charged where the application is concerned with the introduction of new suppliers of defined simple Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) only. Further information: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/425024/Fees_for_new_suppliers_of_defined_simple_active_pharmaceutical_ingredients__APIs_.pdf" rel="external">Fees for New Suppliers of Defined Simple Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">37.1 </span>Bulk fee reductions</h3>

<p>Terminology</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead Case: the first Licence listed on the application form of a specific variation</li>
  <li>Bulk Case: each additional licence included in the application form of a specific variation</li>
</ul>

<p>Reductions for ‘bulks’ of single or group variations are available. You must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the changes are to authorisations registered under the same company number</li>
  <li>the changes are identical across the lead and bulk members, and rely on the same supporting data. (QRD updates to the SPC do not need to meet this requirement)</li>
  <li>the authorisations included are not a combination of Mutual Recognition and National licences</li>
</ul>

<p>Complex variations are subject to different bulk fee reductions</p>

<p>Each bulk case included in the variation carries a 50% reduced fee of the full specified fee for the lead case. The fee type for the lead case is dependent upon the type of submission (grouping/single), the category of variation (Type 1A/1B/2) and procedure type of MA (National/MRP or CMS).</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Type IB or Type II variations that include any Type IA changes require a grouped fee according the highest classification of change. Variations in this format supported by a proof of payment for a single fee (or other lesser fee) will be invalidated.</p>

<h4>Example 1: National Procedures</h4>
<p>Type IB National - lead case - £277, each bulk case - £139
Minor variation (type IB) grouped - lead case - £622, each bulk case £311</p>

<h4>Example 2: Mutual Recognition Procedure.</h4>
<p>CMS major variation (type II) Grouped lead case – £496, each bulk case - £298</p>

<h4>Complex Variations</h4>
<p>The lead case incurs a type II complex or extended complex fee, each bulk member is charged at the relevant single type II fee (national or CMS).</p>

<h4>Grouped Complex Variations</h4>
<p>The lead case incurs a ‘type II grouped complex’ or ‘extended grouped complex fee’ and each bulk member is charged at the type II group major bulk fee (national or CMS).</p>

  <li>
    <p>Definitions of different types of marketing authorisation applications: one of the most common questions we are asked is about the definitions of the different types of marketing authorisation applications. We are therefore publishing an extract from the MHRA fees legislation the The Medicines (Products for Human Use)(Fees) Regulations 2010 S.I No 551 which defines each of the different types of application: See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees">MHRA fees definitions</a> for information.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Clarification of terminology relating to periodic fees: you might find it useful to refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees">terminology relating to periodic fees</a> from the The Medicines (Products for Human Use)(Fees) Regulations 2010 S.I No 551. They will help you determine how to calculate turnover and whether you can claim reduced or maintenance rates for any of your products.</p>

    <p>The Agency’s fees legislation currently has provision for some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mhra-fees/payment-easements-and-waivers-for-small-and-medium-companies">payment easements for small companies and payment waivers for small and medium companies (SME)</a>.</p>
