<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document provides clinical guidance for workplaces using rapid lateral flow tests to identify positive cases of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>You must read and agree to this guidance to qualify for free workplace testing.</p>

<h2>Why testing is important</h2>

<p>Rapid lateral flow tests are a fast and simple way to find people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19, but who may still be spreading the virus.</p>

<p>Testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifies staff who currently have COVID-19 so they can self-isolate</li>
  <li>protects unvaccinated and vulnerable people from infection</li>
  <li>prevents and controls the spread of the virus by identifying asymptomatic cases</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using rapid lateral flow tests</h2>

<p>Rapid lateral flow tests use either nose or throat and nose swabbing to help identify positive cases of COVID-19. They deliver accurate results within 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The testing method and time to deliver results depends on which test type is being used. Manufacturers’ instructions for use must always be followed.</p>

<p>Find detailed guidance and testing information <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-self-test-help">on how to do a rapid lateral flow test for coronavirus</a>.</p>

<h2>Storage of rapid lateral flow tests</h2>

<p>Kits can be stored at room temperature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store extraction solution at 2°C to 30°C</li>
  <li>store the test cartridge at 2°C to 30°C</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organisation requirements</h2>

<p>When taking part in workplace testing, your organisation is expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up and market your test site to participants</li>
  <li>staff your site according to the requirements of your testing option</li>
  <li>provide PPE and waste disposal facilities to your site operatives</li>
  <li>register test sites and make sure results are reported</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workplace testing options</h2>

<p>There are 2 types of workplace testing available. Each method uses rapid lateral flow tests to deliver accurate results within minutes.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Workplace Collect</h3>
<p>Your organisation sets up a collection point at your workplace. Employees can collect rapid lateral flow tests to do at home and self-report their results.</p>

<h3>Workplace Collect workforce requirements</h3>
<p>You need at least one Collection Point Assistant to run your workplace collection point. More roles may be required, such as a Queue Coordinator, depending on how you run Workplace Collect.</p>

<p>All staff will also need to complete online training modules.  A quality lead should be in place to make sure all training is done, and regular competency assessments are carried out.</p>

      <td>Queue coordinator</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Workplace Collect set up</h3>
<p>The size and location of your rapid lateral flow test collection point will vary depending on the space available and the testing needs of your workplace.</p>

<p>Additional requirements may help you decide on a location for your collection point.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>space for social distancing</li>
  <li>easy to clean floors and surfaces</li>
  <li>storage for your rapid lateral flow tests</li>
  <li>making it accessible to all participants</li>
  <li>complying with health, safety and fire regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>The following safety steps should also be followed:</p>

<p>1. Signage to help with social distancing and queue flow.</p>

<p>2. Hand sanitiser stations on arrival.</p>

<p>3. A location away from your main area of business.</p>

<p>4. Access only for operatives and participants.</p>

<p>5. Good <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus/ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">airflow and ventilation</a>.</p>

<p>6. Storage temperature of tests based on manufacturers’ requirements.</p>

<h3>Workplace Collect testing and reporting results</h3>

<p>Volunteers for testing will be given rapid lateral flow tests. They will then need to complete the following steps:</p>

<p>1. Self swab to obtain a sample.</p>

<p>2. Analyse the sample and interpret the results.</p>

<p>3. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">Record the result online</a>.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Asymptomatic Test Sites (<abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr>)</h3>
<p>This allows you to set up a test site at your workplace. Employees volunteer for regular on-site testing using rapid lateral flow tests in a controlled environment. This option requires space to set up a site and staff to help run it.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> workforce requirements</h3>
<p>The number of people required to run your site will scale with the size of your <abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> and the number of people being tested.</p>

<p>Several <abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> roles can be performed by one person, but you are required to have at least 3 full time operatives running an <abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> site. This is so they can provide a dedicated and consistent service.</p>

<p>All staff will also need to complete online training modules. A quality lead should be in place to make sure all training is done, and regular competency assessments are carried out.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> set up</h3>
<p>Asymptomatic test sites are designed to be modular and scalable. This is so they can be set up in different sized workplaces.</p>

<p>You must follow legal, safety and operational requirements for setting up an <abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr>.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making your <abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> accessible to all participants</li>
  <li>adequate lighting and an internet connection for reporting results</li>
  <li>a legal agreement to allow testing if you do not own your testing space</li>
  <li>health and safety and security sign off</li>
  <li>a one way system to manage the flow of participants</li>
  <li>easy to clean floors and surfaces</li>
  <li>good <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus/ventilation-of-indoor-spaces-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">airflow and ventilation</a>
</li>
  <li>space away from your normal day to day workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>How you set up and configure your test site will depend on the size of your space and number of people being tested.</p>

<p>However, you will need 4 essential components:</p>

<p>1. Arrival area: where participants are welcomed and given test registration cards.</p>

<p>2. Testing area: for participants to swab themselves and give their samples to a Testing Operative.</p>

<p>3. Processing area: where Testing Operatives process samples and record results.</p>

<p>4. Exit area: for participants to leave your test site.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Asymptomatic Test Sites">ATS</abbr> testing and reporting results</h3>

<p>Volunteers for testing will be given a barcode with their rapid lateral flow test. They will then need to register their test on the GOV.UK register a test service, either before or after they take their swab. This will link their personal details with their test record so they can receive results.</p>

<p>After swabbing, workforce staff will need to complete the following steps:</p>

<p>1. Samples will be analysed on site by the Processing Operative.</p>

<p>2. Results will be recorded by the Results Recorder.</p>

<p>3. These will then upload to the <a href="https://log-coronavirus-test-site-results.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">log site COVID-19 results</a> service.</p>

<p>The individual will then receive their results directly.</p>
