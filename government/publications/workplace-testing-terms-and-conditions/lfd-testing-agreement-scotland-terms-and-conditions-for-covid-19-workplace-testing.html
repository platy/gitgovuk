<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This Agreement is entered into between The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care as part of the Crown through the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) of Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3HX, United Kingdom and the organisation which has agreed to participate in the testing programme described in this Agreement (‘Participating Organisation’) on the earlier of:</p>

<p>(i) 	the date on which the representative of the Participating Organisation confirms their agreement to these terms and conditions as part of registering the Participating Organisation with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> for the Testing Programme defined below (‘Registration’) through the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Testing Programme online portal (‘Portal’); or</p>

<p>(ii) 	the date on which the Participating Organisation commences any participation in the Testing Programme (and by such participation, the Participating Organisation confirms their agreement to the terms and conditions of this Agreement).</p>

<p>This Agreement is formed of:</p>

<p>(i)	these <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> terms and conditions for COVID-19 testing, including (in the case of Workplace Collect Testing as defined below) Annex A and its Addendum and Annex B;</p>

<p>(ii)	the Clinical Standard Operating Procedure for mass testing with Lateral Flow Antigen Testing Devices supplied to the Participating Organisation as part of or subsequent to their Registration (the ‘<abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr>’); and</p>

<p>(iii)	any details submitted by the Participating Organisation and/or displayed in the Portal as part of its Registration.</p>

<p>As part of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s wider efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is supporting a testing programme for employers which uses lateral flow device (‘<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>’) test kits to aim to identify asymptomatic individuals who have COVID-19 (‘Testing Programme’). <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the Participating Organisation have agreed to co-operate in the Testing Programme.</p>

<p>This Agreement covers 2 separate workstreams of the Testing Programme:</p>

<p>(i)	ATS Testing: being the Participating Organisation’s running of a COVID-19 testing facility (‘Facility’) at one or more of the Participating Organisation’s operating location(s) (‘Location’). Part B of this Agreement (clauses 4 to 6) and Annex A and Annex B do not apply to ATS Testing.</p>

<p>(ii)	Workplace Collect Testing: being the Participating Organisation’s running of a COVID-19  self-testing programme, where <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> self-test kits are provided to asymptomatic individuals for use at home. Part A of this Agreement (clauses 1 to 3) does not apply to Workplace Collect Testing.</p>

<p>A Participating Organisation may only participate in the above workstreams of the Testing Programme as agreed with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> as part of its Registration or as otherwise agreed in writing with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, or any later update via the Portal.</p>

<p>This Agreement applies to private industry Participating Organisations, third sector Participating Organisations and public sector Participating Organisations (including Crown Bodies). Certain provisions of this Agreement are modified in the case of public sector Participating Organisations (see clause 18) and Crown Bodies (see clause 19).</p>

<h2>Part A: ATS Testing</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Basis of the ATS Testing</h2>

<p>1.1	The Facility will test such of the Participating Organisation’s employees, consultants, directors, contractors, sub-contractors or other individuals who work at the Location and visitors to the Location, in each case who volunteer and are over the age of 18 years old, and any other category of individual which <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> agrees in writing can be included in the ATS Testing (together ‘Test Subjects’).  In the case of visitors to the Location, such visitors may only be included in the ATS Testing to the extent consistent with any relevant guidance published by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> through the Portal as such guidance is updated by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> from time to time (‘Guidance’) or as otherwise expressly agreed by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Participating Organisation responsibilities</h2>

<p>2.1	The Participating Organisation shall perform the testing as described in this clause 2 (‘Testing’) in accordance with the <abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr> and with all reasonable skill and care.</p>

<p>2.2	Subject to Clause 3, the Participating Organisation shall provide all of the resources and materials that are necessary to enable the Participating Organisation to run, manage and control a testing Facility for the Test Subjects at the Location(s) notified to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> as part of Registration. The Participating Organisation may add one or more additional Facility Locations to this Agreement, or change the address of any existing Location, via the procedure notified to the Participating Organisation by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> may, at its sole discretion, refuse to include any Facility Location in the Testing Programme.</p>

<p>2.3	The Participating Organisation shall be responsible for the management of the day to day testing process. In particular, the Participating Organisation shall:</p>

<h4>Set up and marketing of Facility</h4>

<p>2.3.1	be solely responsible for the communications, engagement and publication of the Testing to potential Test Subjects, which may include the creation of a dedicated webpage on the Participating Organisation’s intranet, the circulation of communications providing details of the Testing, sending personalised invitations to potential Test Subjects, and the displaying of posters at the Participating Organisation’s operating locations. The Participating Organisation shall make it clear in relevant communications that the Testing is on a voluntary basis;</p>

<p>2.3.2	be responsible for the set-up and configuration of the Facility and ensuring the configuration is in accordance with the <abbr title="standard operating procedure">SOP</abbr>;</p>
