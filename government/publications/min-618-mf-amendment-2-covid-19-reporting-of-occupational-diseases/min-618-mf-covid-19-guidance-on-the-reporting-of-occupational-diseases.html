<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This notice gives guidance on the reporting of diagnosed COVID-19 cases among seafarers on board ships, where there is reasonable evidence that it was caused by exposure at work and on how to decide whether a case of COVID-19 is reportable.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 The employer of a seafarer on a UK ship must report to MCA when they are notified that a seafarer who works (or has worked) on a ship is suffering (or did suffer) from an occupational disease (The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997, regulation 11A).</p>

<p>1.2 Reportable occupational diseases are specified in MSN 1850 (M) Annex 1. They include</p>

<p>‘Any disease attributed to an occupational exposure to a biological agent.’</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> COVID-19 cases</h2>

<p>2.1 In respect of COVID-19, an employer is only required to make a report when a seafarer has been infected with COVID-19 through;</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliberately working with the virus, such as in a laboratory</li>
  <li>being incidentally exposed to the virus</li>
</ul>

<p>2.2 Incidental exposure can occur when working in environments where people are known to have COVID-19, for example a medical practitioner, nurse or seafarer who is diagnosed with COVID-19 after treating or caring for someone with COVID-19 as part of their work on the ship, or supporting activities such as cleaning.</p>

<p>2.3 The following should be reported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a seafarer has been diagnosed as having COVID-19 attributed to an occupational exposure to COVID-19, through either deliberately working with the virus or being incidentally exposed to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a seafarer dies as a result of occupational exposure to COVID-19 through either deliberately working with the virus or being incidentally exposed to it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2.4 In such cases, the disease is reported as a case of disease as a result of exposure to a biological agent.</p>

<p>2.5 In accordance with MSN 1850(M), a case is reportable only if the employer has received a written diagnosis of a specified disease from a medical practitioner. However, unlike with usual diagnosis of occupational disease, many cases of COVID-19 are confirmed without a medical practitioner’s written diagnosis, for example, on the basis of laboratory test results. Therefore MCA will not require those results to be confirmed by a medical practitioner before a case of COVID-19 resulting from work is reported. Any official confirmation of COVID-19 infection such as from a public testing body or a positive lateral flow test (LFT) should be considered as being equivalent to a medical practitioner’s diagnosis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> What not to report</h2>

<p>3.1 The following should not be reported as cases of occupational disease:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cases of disease or deaths of members of the public, such as passengers, from COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cases where an employee has infected another employee with COVID-19 through general transmission in the workplace</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cases where a member of the public has infected an employee with COVID-19 through general transmission in the workplace, unless infection is likely to have occurred from working in an environment with a person known to have COVID-19, for example in a medical setting.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Making a report</h2>

<p>4.1 A report must be made on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/occupational-disease-report-form-for-uk-registered-merchant-ships-msf-4159-rev-0714">MSF 4159</a>.</p>
