<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance tells caseworkers how to consider applications to enter, remain or settle in the UK under the Scale-up route. “You” in this guidance means a caseworker.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed to be used alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Scale-up</a> of the Immigration Rules. The rules explain the requirements an applicant must meet, and this guidance provides additional information on how to consider their application.</p>

<p>Paragraph references refer to Appendix Scale-up unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>You may also need to refer to the following sections of the Rules, where relevant:</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Version 1.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 22 August 2022</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This is new guidance.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Scale-up route</h2>

<p>This section provides an introduction to the Scale-up route.</p>

<p>The Scale-up route was introduced on 22 August 2022 and provides a route for UK businesses, who have demonstrated a sustained period of growth, to sponsor talented individuals who have the skills needed to enable that business to continue growing.</p>

<p>Unlike other sponsorship routes, individuals are only required to work for their sponsors for a short initial period and are free to also take other types of employment during this period, providing they continue to undertake their sponsored job. At the end of the sponsored period the sponsor duties fall away but the individual can remain employed by the sponsor or leave their employment.</p>

<p>Dependent partners and children can apply on this route, as set out in the dependants guidance.</p>

<p>Scale-up is a route to settlement in the UK.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The requirements applicants must meet are split into 3 parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Validity requirements – these outline the minimum requirements which must be met for the application to be considered fully. They ensure, for example, the applicant has used the correct form and supplied their identity documents. Applications which do not meet these requirements are invalid and may be rejected and not considered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suitability requirements – these check the suitability of the applicant to be granted any form of permission, not specifically whether they qualify as a Scale-up worker. Applicants must not fall for refusal on general grounds or be in breach of immigration laws. Applicants who do not meet these requirements must be refused.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eligibility requirements – these are the main criteria specific to the Scale-up route. Applicants who do not meet these requirements must be refused.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The table below sets out the paragraphs in Appendix Scale-up for each of these requirements:</p>

<table>

</table>

<h3>Representatives</h3>

<p>If an applicant has a UK based representative, you must check the representative is approved to provide immigration advice with either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-immigration-services-commissioner">office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC)</a>
</li>
  <li>one of the following authorities:
    <ul>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/" rel="external">the Law Society</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lawscot.org.uk/" rel="external">the Law Society of Scotland</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lawsoc-ni.org/" rel="external">the Law Society of Northern Ireland</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.barcouncil.org.uk/" rel="external">the General Council of the Bar</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cilex.org.uk/" rel="external">the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.advocates.org.uk/" rel="external">the Faculty of Advocates</a></li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.barofni.com/" rel="external">the General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Scale-up sponsors are also able to provide immigration advice and services to those they sponsor. They cannot do this beyond the initial six-month period, regardless of whether the Scale-up worker continues to be employed by them, as the sponsorship relationship automatically ends after six months.</p>

<p>If the representative does not have the necessary permission to provide immigration advice, you must direct all communications to the applicant instead.</p>

<h3>Burden and standard of proof</h3>

<p>The burden of proof is on the applicant to show they meet the requirements of the route. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (which means it is more likely than not they meet the requirements). When considering the application, you should have regard to all the relevant information and you should request more information, or clarification, if you need to do so.</p>

<h3>Requesting more information</h3>

<p>If you need more information, or clarification of certain details to be able to consider granting an application, you should request more information. Where possible, you should try to identify all areas where further information is required, so it can be requested at the same time.</p>

<h3>Verifying documents</h3>

<h4>Verification checks</h4>

<p>You must be satisfied that the documents an applicant has submitted with their application are genuine. The documents can be copies or scanned images. You may need to verify documentation if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you have reasonable doubts about the authenticity of any document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is an instruction based on risk-profiles</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The process for verifying documents will vary in each case, but may involve checking the authenticity of documents with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>banks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the relevant embassy or high commission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other government departments (in the UK and overseas)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of these checks is to make sure that the document provided is genuine and accurately reflects statements made in the application. There is guidance available on how to refer documents to the V&amp;C Sheffield Enrichment &amp; Document Verification Team, which is responsible for conducting verification checks for marriage and family (M&amp;F), work and study (W&amp;S) routes.</p>

<p>Verification checks will be returned with one of the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>documents have been confirmed to be genuine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>documents have been confirmed to be false</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the check returns an inconclusive result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the documents have been confirmed as genuine, you must continue to consider the application.</p>

<p>If the documents have been confirmed as false, you must refer to guidance on general grounds for refusal. You must retain the document verification report on the case work system.</p>

<p>If the verification check returns as inconclusive, you must disregard the document as evidence. This means the applicant cannot rely on this evidence, but if there is other evidence that shows the applicant meets the requirement, this can be relied on instead.</p>

<h3>Translating documents</h3>

<p>If the documents are not in English or Welsh, the applicant must provide a fully certified translation from a professional translator or translation company that can independently be verified by the Home Office. The translation must include all the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation it is an accurate translation of the document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date of the translation</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the translator or translation company’s contact details</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If no translation is supplied, you should request one. If the applicant still does not provide a translation or if you are unable to verify the translation, the document should be disregarded and not considered. You must continue to process the application as if the applicant had not provided the document (although it should be retained on the casework system).</p>

<h2>Validity for entry clearance and permission to stay</h2>

<p>This section tells you where to find the validity requirements relating to applications for entry clearance or permission to stay as a Scale-up worker.</p>

<p>Before considering suitability and eligibility, you must check whether the application is valid by referring to paragraphs SCU 1.1. to SCU 1.6.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied the application meets all the validity requirements, you should consider whether to request more information, reject the application or proceed to consider.</p>

<p>You must consult the Validation, variation and withdrawal of applications guidance if you need further guidance on validity requirements.</p>

<h3>Application fees and Immigration Health Charge</h3>

<p>The applicant must have paid the relevant application fee and any Immigration Health Charge (sometimes called the Immigration Health Surcharge or IHS). For further information, please see the guidance on the Immigration Health Charge.</p>

<h3>Biometrics and identity documents</h3>

<p>You must be satisfied, where the applicant has provided their biometrics, these are verified against a valid passport or other travel document they have supplied.</p>

<h3>Certificate of sponsorship</h3>

<p>If the application is a sponsored application, the applicant must have a valid Scale- up Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS). This is a virtual document (similar to a database record) which is assigned by the sponsor. Sponsors use a secure IT system called the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsor management system</a> (SMS) to assign a CoS.</p>

<p>The reference number for the CoS should be provided in the application. If the applicant has not supplied a reference number, they must provide an explanation. If you are not satisfied the sponsor has assigned a CoS to the applicant, you may reject the application. If the reason the sponsor has not yet assigned a CoS is because of delays by UKVI (for example, a delay in processing a sponsor licence application or a request for CoS), you may exceptionally place the case on hold pending the outcome.</p>

<p>You must check the CoS was assigned to the applicant no more than 3 months before the date of application. If it was assigned more than 3 months before the date of application, you may ask the applicant to provide a more recent CoS. If they do not do so the application may be rejected as invalid.</p>

<p>For information on how to check the CoS information, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#certificate_checking">Certificate of Sponsorship checking system</a> (the CoS will also need to be viewed when assessing the eligibility requirements.)</p>

<h3>Minimum age</h3>

<p>All applicants must be aged 18 or over on the date of application.</p>

<h3>Government or international scholarship agency awards</h3>

<p>Where an applicant has received an award covering fees and living costs from a government or international scholarship agency in the 12 months before the date of application, the government or agency must provide written consent to the application. If this consent is not provided with the application, you may request it form the applicant and, if it is not provided, you may reject the application as invalid.</p>

<h3>Switching</h3>

<p>An applicant who is in the UK cannot apply to switch into the Scale-up route if they have, or were last granted, permission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as a Visitor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Short-term Student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Parent of a Child Student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Seasonal Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Domestic Worker in a Private Household</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outside the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An application which does not meet all the above validity requirements is invalid and may be rejected and not considered using the rejection template on the case work system.</p>

<h3>Irish citizens</h3>

<p>Most Irish citizens do not need permission to live and work in the UK and therefore are not eligible to apply for permission under the Immigration Rules (see Common Travel Area (CTA) guidance on Irish citizens) Common Travel Area. You must void any application for a visa from an Irish citizen as invalid, except where they are subject to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a deportation order made under section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an exclusion decision, or an exclusion order made under regulation 23(5) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a travel ban implemented under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an Irish citizen falls within one of the above categories, you should consider their application in line with the rules in the same way as any other applicant.</p>

<p>If further information is required, please contact the CTA Policy Team.</p>

<h2>Suitability for entry clearance and permission to stay applications</h2>

<p>This section tells you where to find the suitability requirements an applicant must meet when they apply for entry clearance or permission to stay as a Scale-up Worker.</p>

<p>You must check the application meets the suitability requirements by referring to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the suitability requirements for Scale-up Worker, set out in paragraphs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">SCU</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">2.1. to SCU 2.2.</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications which do not meet the suitability requirements must be refused. You will need to review the applicant’s immigration history, any flags or alerts on the case work system, the answers given to the suitability questions on the application form and consider the guidance on Part 9 grounds for refusal.</p>

<h3>Overstaying</h3>

<p>You must check the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except for periods of overstaying which can be disregarded under paragraph 39E of the Immigration Rules. Refer to the guidance for overstaying. You can check the applicant’s current immigration status on Atlas.</p>

<h3>Immigration bail</h3>

<p>Any applicant who is in the UK on immigration bail does not meet the suitability requirements for the Scale-up route. You can check whether the applicant is on bail by checking the relevant caseworker systems.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tuberculosis certificates</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the tuberculosis (TB) certificate requirement for applications for entry clearance on the Scale-up route.</p>

<p>An applicant must provide a valid TB certificate with their application, if they have been residing within a country listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t-tuberculosis-screening">Appendix T of the Immigration Rules</a> for more than 6 months immediately preceding the application.</p>

<p>If an applicant has not supplied a valid TB test certificate when they are required to, you may contact them and request that they do so, or in exceptional circumstances seek a waiver, and if they do not you must refuse the application under paragraph SCU 3.2.</p>

<p>There is information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">GOV.UK</a> regarding which applicants are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk">required to obtain a</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk">TB certificate</a> before applying and the valid test centres.</p>

<p>If an applicant scores fewer than 70 points, you must refuse their application and explain where you have not awarded points using the relevant template paragraphs.</p>

<h2>Sponsored permission</h2>

<h3>Sponsorship requirements</h3>

<p>This section explains how to assess the sponsorship requirement for Scale-up Workers.</p>

<p>The applicant must score 50 points for sponsorship. To award these points, you must be satisfied the application meets the requirements in paragraphs SCU 5.1. to SCU 7.6.</p>

<p>An applicant may make more than one application under the sponsored route for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they failed to complete 6 months working for their sponsor in a previous permission on the Scale-up route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where their previous permission expired more than 6 months ago</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where an applicant has previously been granted permission as a Scale-up worker under the sponsorship requirements and the above does not apply, they must apply and be considered under the unsponsored requirements.</p>

<h3>Valid certificate of sponsorship</h3>

<p>A certificate of sponsorship (CoS) is only valid if certain requirements are met. The CoS assigned to the applicant must meet the requirements set out in paragraph SCU</p>

<p>5.1. You should contact the sponsor to request any missing details.</p>

<h3>Licensed sponsor</h3>

<p>The sponsor must hold a valid Scale-up sponsor licence. The sponsor must also be A-rated. See the sponsor guidance for more details.</p>

<p>You must confirm these requirements are met by accessing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">Certificate of</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">Sponsorship Checking System</a>. You can contact the Sponsor Licensing Unit (SLU) to find out more information about the status of the sponsor’s licence if needed.</p>

<p>If the applicant’s sponsor loses its licence while the application is under consideration, you have a duty to inform the applicant promptly.</p>

<p>You must only inform the applicant their sponsor no longer has a licence, not the reasons why. The only exception is if the licence was revoked for reasons directly linked to this particular application, and those reasons therefore have particular relevance to the refusal – for example, you are refusing on genuine vacancy grounds, as well as the fact the sponsor is no longer licensed.</p>

<h3>Immigration Skills Charge</h3>

<p>A Scale-up sponsor is not required to pay the Immigration Skills Charge.</p>

<h3>Genuine vacancy</h3>

<p>You must not award points for sponsorship if you have reasonable grounds to believe the job the applicant is being sponsored to do either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>does not exist</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is a sham (for example, the job exists but the applicant will not be doing it)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has been created mainly so the applicant can apply for permission</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess this, you may need to request additional information (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#requesting_information">Requesting more information</a>).</p>

<p>Genuine vacancy concerns may lead to a compliance visit to the sponsor. Where it is not possible at the outset to decide such applications, they should remain on hold pending the outcome of a compliance visit. You must inform the applicant their application is on hold due to further checks with their sponsor at the same time as you inform the sponsor of those checks, but you must not disclose any as-yet- unproven concerns about the sponsor. If the result is the sponsor’s licence is revoked, you must explain fully any genuine vacancy concerns in the decision letter, and not rely solely on the fact the sponsor does not have a licence.</p>

<p>If you believe the applicant is complicit in being sponsored for a vacancy which is not genuine, you must follow the minded to refuse process (set out in the false representations guidance) and may consider inviting them to attend an interview.</p>

<p>You must put your concerns to the applicant in clear language and give them the chance to respond (either in an interview or in writing) before making a decision. If you find the applicant to be complicit, you must include this in the refusal decision. For more details, you should consider the guidance on false representations as in some cases it may also be appropriate to refuse on suitability grounds.</p>

<h3>Working with third parties</h3>

<p>Where a Scale-up Worker is being supplied to one organisation by another organisation, their sponsor must be whoever has full responsibility for the duties, functions and outcomes, or outputs of the job.</p>

<p>For example, company A has a contract with a client - company Z - to deliver an IT solution within agreed timescales. An applicant, who is sponsored by company A to work on that project, may be sent to work for the length of the contract at company Z’s premises, but they remain employed by company A throughout the period of the contract. As company A is responsible for their duties, functions, outputs or outcomes, company A must be the applicant’s sponsor.</p>

<p>A sponsor can only assign a CoS if they have full responsibility for deciding the duties, functions and outcomes or outputs of the job. Where the applicant is carrying</p>

<p>out work for a third party on their sponsor’s behalf, they must be contracted by their sponsor to provide a time-bound, non-routine service or project on their sponsor’s behalf. This means a service or project which has a specific end date, after which it will have ended, or the service provided will no longer be operated by their sponsor or anyone else. It also means an applicant must not be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hired to a third party who is not the sponsor to fill a position with that party, whether temporary or permanent (for example, an agency worker filling a vacancy with a third-party), unless this is work undertaken in addition to the one for which they are being sponsored for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>engaging in contract work to undertake an ongoing routine role or to provide an ongoing routine service for a third party who is not their sponsor, regardless of the nature or length of any arrangement between the sponsor and the third party, unless this is work undertaken in addition to the one for which they are being sponsored for</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Job at appropriate skill level</h3>

<p>This section explains how to assess the skill level requirement for the Scale-up route.</p>

<p>Under the sponsorship requirement, you must be satisfied the applicant is being sponsored in an occupation code listed as being eligible for the Scale-up route in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations</a>.</p>

<h4>Exaggerated or incorrect occupation codes</h4>

<p>You must not award points for a job at the appropriate skill level if you have reasonable grounds to believe the sponsor has not chosen an appropriate occupation code. Factors which may indicate this could include when either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the job description appears to be a standard or template response used for other businesses and the application is in a high-risk sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant has been refused previously on similar grounds This is not an exhaustive list.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A sponsor may have chosen a less appropriate occupation code either by accidental error or intentionally. You should request additional information where you have concerns (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#requesting_information">Requesting more information</a>), to give the sponsor an opportunity to correct any accidental error and/or address any questions about whether they have misrepresented the job.</p>

<p>You should consider whether the sponsor has chosen a less appropriate occupation code for any of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to make a job which is not at the appropriate skill level appear more skilled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to be able to pay the applicant a lower going rate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To support this assessment, you may in particular consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the sponsor has shown a genuine need for the job as described</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the applicant has the appropriate skills, qualifications and experience needed to do the job as described</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sponsor’s history of compliance with the immigration system including, but not limited to, paying its sponsored workers appropriately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any additional information from the sponsor This is not an exhaustive list.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Concerns about exaggerated or incorrect jobs may lead to a compliance visit to the sponsor. Where it is not possible at the outset to decide such applications, they should remain on hold pending the outcome of a compliance visit. You must inform the applicant their application is on hold due to further checks with their sponsor but must not disclose any as-yet-unproven concerns about the sponsor. If the result is the sponsor’s licence is revoked, you must explain fully any genuine vacancy concerns in the decision letter, and not rely solely on the fact the sponsor does not have a licence.</p>

<p>If you consider the applicant is aware their job is not at the appropriate skill level and is complicit in misrepresenting it, you must follow the minded to refuse process (set out in the false representations guidance) and may consider inviting them to attend an interview. You must put your concerns to the applicant in clear language and give them the chance to respond (either in an interview or in writing) before making a decision. If you find the applicant is complicit, you must include this in the refusal decision.</p>

<p>The implications for an applicant of a finding of deception can be significant and is a fact-sensitive issue. If an applicant is lawfully in the UK, the consequences are likely to be serious and to mean you must give the applicant a chance to respond before refusing their application. If the application is for entry clearance, it will not reach the required level of seriousness, because in most such cases a refusal will not change the applicant’s circumstances. For more details, you should consider the guidance on false representations as in some cases it may be appropriate to also refuse on suitability grounds.</p>

<h3>ATAS requirement</h3>

<p>Applicants must provide a valid Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are being sponsored as a Scale-up Worker by a sponsor which is also a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students">licensed Student sponsor</a> (these will mainly be universities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are not one of the exempt nationals listed in paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-atas-academic-technology-approval-scheme-atas">ATAS 3.1</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their job is in one of the occupation codes listed in paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-atas-academic-technology-approval-scheme-atas">ATAS 1.2(a)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the job includes an element of PhD-level research in a relevant subject (and these subjects are listed in paragraph <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-atas-academic-technology-approval-scheme-atas">ATAS 4.1</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The details are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-atas-academic-technology-approval-scheme-atas">Appendix ATAS.</a> Sponsors should confirm on the applicant’s CoS whether the ATAS requirement applies.</p>

<p>If the first three bullet points above apply, but the sponsor has not provided a note to say whether the ATAS requirement applies and the applicant has not provided an ATAS certificate, you should contact the sponsor to confirm whether the requirement applies. If the sponsor fails to provide the necessary confirmation, you should not award points for sponsorship (paragraph SCU 5.1.(f)).</p>

<p>If the sponsor confirms the ATAS requirement applies and the applicant has not provided an ATAS certificate, you should consider contacting the applicant (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#requesting_information">Requesting more information</a>). Processing an ATAS application takes at least 20 working days and can take 30 or more working days between April and September. You should allow the standard 10 working days for the applicant to respond but consider extending the deadline if the applicant confirms they have submitted their ATAS application and are waiting for a response.</p>

<p>If an applicant does not provide a copy of a valid ATAS certificate when required, you should not award points for sponsorship (paragraph SCU 7.6. with reference to SCU 5.1 (f)).</p>

<h3>Assessing appropriate salary</h3>

<p>This section explains how to assess salaries for Scale-up Workers.</p>

<p>Sponsors must pay applicants a salary which equals or exceeds all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>£33,000 per year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£10.10 per hour</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the going rate for the occupation code</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an applicant is being sponsored to work more than 48 hours a week, only the salary for the first 48 hours a week will be considered towards the salary requirements set out in SCU 7.1(a) of the immigration rules.</p>

<p>For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week for £12.50 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £31,200 (£12.50 x 48 x 52) per year and not £39,000 (£12.50 x 60 x 52).</p>

<h3>What to include</h3>

<p>Only guaranteed basic gross pay can be included (see paragraphs SCU 7.2 to SCU 7.3). No other pay and benefits must be included when assessing salary. Examples of pay and benefits which are not included are listed in paragraph SCU 7.2. This is not an exhaustive list. However, if an applicant has chosen to give up part of their basic pay as part of a salary sacrifice scheme, this should not be deducted.</p>

<h3>The general threshold</h3>

<p>The general threshold is the minimum salary of £33,000 per year which applies regardless of the applicant’s occupation code. If the going rate for the applicant’s occupation is below £33,000, they must still be paid at least this amount to qualify for the route.</p>

<h3>The going rate</h3>

<p>The going rate is the minimum salary which applies for a particular occupation code. The going rates are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-skilled-occupations">Appendix Skilled Occupations.</a></p>

<p>Going rates must be pro-rated based on the weekly working hours stated on the certificate of sponsorship (CoS).</p>

<p>The going rates in Table 1 of Appendix Skilled Occupations are based on a 39-hour week. Hourly rates are shown in brackets. To avoid rounding errors, you should pro- rate the going rate based on the annual figure, rather than the hourly figure. You do this by dividing the annual going rate by 39, then multiplying by the weekly hours stated by the sponsor. For example, if the annual going rate is £36,000 and the applicant is sponsored to work a 26-hour week, the pro-rating calculation would be:</p>

<p>£36,000 ÷ 39 x 26 = £24,000</p>

<p>The going rates in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations are based on a 40-hour week (doctors), a 37.5-hour week (NHS Agenda for Change occupations) or the definition of a full-time worker (teaching occupations). The pro-rating calculation must be adjusted accordingly, for example dividing by 37.5 rather than by 39. For teaching occupations (where weekly working hours are not consistent throughout the year, due to term dates), you should ask the sponsor to confirm what proportion of a full-time equivalent (FTE) the applicant is, and pro-rate the going rate accordingly.</p>

<p>The applicant’s full weekly hours must be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week. For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week in an occupation code with a going rate of £39,000 must be paid £60,000 (£39,000 ÷ 39 x 60), not £48,000 (£39,000 ÷ 39 x 48).</p>

<h3>The £10.10 minimum hourly rate</h3>

<p>Applicants must also be paid a minimum rate of £10.10 per hour, even if this is higher than the going rate. As with the going rate, all the applicant’s weekly hours must be included. Sponsors cannot claim overtime is supplementary employment to justify paying a lower rate, as overtime would still be considered part of the job the applicant is being sponsored for.</p>

<p>The £10.10 rate applies to all occupations in Table 1 of Appendix Skilled Occupations (tradeable points options A to E). It does not apply to occupations in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, where national pay scales are used to identify the going rates (tradeable points option F).</p>

<h2>Unsponsored permission</h2>

<p>This section explains how to assess the unsponsored requirement for Scale-up Workers.</p>

<p>The applicant must score 50 points for UK earnings in their permission as a Scale-up Worker. To award these points, you must be satisfied the application meets the requirements in paragraphs SCU 8.1. to SCU 8.7.</p>

<h3>Assessing UK earnings</h3>

<p>The applicant must meet the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have, or have held in the 6 months immediately before the date of application, permission as a Scale-up Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>must have had PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least £33,000 per year, during at least 50% of their permission as a Scale-up Worker</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an applicant with 3 years’ permission as a Scale-up Worker must have had this level of earnings during at least 18 moths of that permission.</p>

<p>To meet the earnings requirement, an applicant must show that they have earned a gross monthly salary equivalent to £33,000 per annum, for 50% of their period of permission. Applicants cannot offset months where their gross earnings are below £2,750 by relying on months with a higher level of earnings. You must not average earnings across the whole 12-month period.</p>

<h3>Periods of absence from work</h3>

<p>Where an applicant was in employment in a job paying at least £33,000 you must count this time as satisfying the earnings requirement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>statutory maternity leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory paternity leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory parental leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory shared parental leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory adoption leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory sick leave</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an application who spent 6 months on the above types of leave during a 2-year permission as a Scale-up Worker, must have had PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least £33,000 per year during at least 6 months of the remaining 18 months of that permission.</p>

<h3>What to include</h3>

<p>Only guaranteed basic gross pay can be included (see paragraphs SCU 8.3 to SCU 8.4). No other pay and benefits must be included when assessing salary. Examples of pay and benefits which are not included are listed in paragraph SCU 8.4. This is not an exhaustive list. However, if an applicant has chosen to give up part of their basic pay as part of a salary sacrifice scheme, this should not be deducted.</p>

<h3>Earnings which cannot be included</h3>

<p>An applicant cannot seek to rely on other sources of income, such as any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>earnings from self-employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>earnings from outside of the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payments not recorded through PAYE, such as dividends, allowances, in-kind benefits or reimbursements for business expenses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employer pension and employer national insurance contributions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>income from savings, investments, property, inheritance, gambling or competitions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Earnings from multiple jobs</h3>

<p>Where an applicant is relying on earnings from more than one job you must check to ensure that they are not claiming more than one set of PAYE earnings that cover the same period. There is no limit on the number of jobs an applicant can use to meet the earnings requirement, but you must ensure any claimed earnings are from different months.</p>

<h4>Example one</h4>

<p>Applicant claims earnings for Job A which runs from January to April and Job B which runs from May to December. All PAYE earnings from both these jobs could be included when assessing whether the applicant meets the £33,000 requirement.</p>

<h4>Example two</h4>

<p>Applicant claims earnings for Job A which runs January to June and Job B which runs April to December. PAYE earnings from both these jobs can be counted, but you must only use PAYE earnings from one of these for the period April to June. You must use the job which has the higher earnings and is therefore more beneficial to the applicant.</p>

<h4>Example three</h4>

<p>Applicant claims earnings for Job A which runs January to November and Job B which also runs January to November. As both these jobs only existed for the same period you must only use the one with the higher level of PAYE earnings when considering if the applicant meets the £33,000 requirement.</p>

<h2>Language requirement</h2>

<p>This section explains how to assess the language requirement for Scale-up Workers.</p>

<p>The applicant must score 10 points for English language skills equivalent to at least level B1 of the Common European Framework of References for English language in all 4 components (reading, writing, speaking and listening). To award these points, you must be satisfied the application meets the requirements in paragraphs SCU 9.1. to SCU 9.3 and Appendix English Language requirement.</p>

<p>To assess whether the requirement is met, you should refer to the Language guidance.</p>

<h2>Financial requirement</h2>

<p>This section explains how to assess the financial requirement for Scale-up Workers.</p>

<p>An applicant will automatically meet the financial requirement when they are applying for permission to stay in the UK, having been in the UK for at least 12 months with permission on the date of application. See the financial requirement guidance for details on how to consider this.</p>

<p>When the applicant is applying for entry clearance, or for permission to stay and has been in the UK for less than 12 months, an applicant can meet the financial requirement by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>their sponsor (providing they are A-rated) certifying they will, if necessary, maintain and accommodate the applicant up to the end of the first month of their employment, to an amount of at least £1,270</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>providing evidence showing they have held funds of at least £1,270 for a 28- day period as set out in the financial requirement guidance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Settlement</h2>

<p>This section explains how to assess settlement applications on the Scale-up route.</p>

<p>The validity and suitability requirements for settlement applications are set out at paragraphs SCU 13.1. to SCU 14.2. Refer to the validity and suitability sections earlier in this document for more information, although no certificate of sponsorship (CoS) or Immigration Health Charge payment is needed for settlement applications.</p>

<p>The guidance below explains how to assess the eligibility requirements, which are set out at paragraphs SCU 15.1. to SCU 19.2.</p>

<h3>Validity requirements for settlement</h3>

<p>Before considering suitability and eligibility, you must check the application is valid by referring to paragraphs SCU 13.1. to SCU 13.4.</p>

<p>All applicants for settlement on the Scale-up route must have, or have last been granted, permission as a Scale-up Worker.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied the application meets all the validity requirements, you should consider whether to request more information, reject the application or proceed to consider.</p>

<p>You must consult the Validation, variation and withdrawal of applications guidance if you need further guidance on the cross cutting validity requirements</p>

<h3>Qualifying period</h3>

<p>The applicant must have spent a continuous period of 5 years in the UK, consisting of time with permission on any of, or any combination of, the following routes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scale-up</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skilled Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global Talent</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>Tier 1 (Investor)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 1 (General</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Absences from the UK must be considered in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-continuous-residence">Appendix Continuous Residence</a>. See the continuous residence guidance for further details.</p>

<h3>Knowledge of life in the UK</h3>

<p>The applicant must meet the Knowledge of Life in the UK requirement as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-kol-uk">Appendix KOL UK</a>. They do not need to meet a language requirement for settlement, as they will have met this in their previous Scale-up application.</p>

<h3>PAYE employment in the UK</h3>

<p>The applicant must be in PAYE employment in the UK with a salary of at least £33,000 per year, on the date of application.</p>

<h3>Assessing UK earnings</h3>

<p>The applicant must have had monthly PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least £33,000 per year for at least 24 months of the 3 years immediately before the date of application.</p>

<p>You can only include basic gross PAYE salary (before income tax and including employee pension and national insurance contributions), from the UK. You cannot include earnings from other sources of income, such as any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>earnings from self-employment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>earnings from outside of the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payments not recorded through PAYE, such as dividends, allowances, in-kind benefits or reimbursements for business expenses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employer pension and employer national insurance contributions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>income from savings, investments, property, inheritance, gambling or competitions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must check the applicant’s PAYE records for the earnings period claimed, this should be at least 24 months of the 3 years immediately before the date of application.</p>

<p>Until automated PAYE checks are available, applicants should provide payslips, P60s and either a bank/building society statement or building society passbook, covering every month which they have claimed PAYE earnings for, with their application.</p>

<p>If you have reasonable grounds to believe the PAYE earnings the applicant is relying on have been inflated or fabricated, or do not relate to genuine employment, you should discuss the case with a manager and consider requesting further information. You will need to assess the credibility on the balance of probabilities. In particular you may want to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the business from which the earnings are claimed can be shown to exist and be lawfully and genuinely trading in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any payments made by the applicant to other parties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other relevant information</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<h3>Periods of absence</h3>

<p>Where an applicant was in employment in a job paying at least £33,000 a year. You must count this time as satisfying the earnings requirement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>statutory maternity leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory paternity leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory parental leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory shared parental leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory adoption leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory sick leave</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an application who spent 6 months on the above types of leave during their last 3-year’s permission as a Scale-up Worker, must have had PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least £33,000 per year during at least 18 months of the remaining 30 months of that permission.</p>

<h2>Requesting more information</h2>

<p>This section tells you about requesting more information or supporting documents related to Scale-up Worker applications.</p>

<p>Applicants and their sponsors should provide all the necessary evidence and information with the application and certificate of sponsorship (CoS). If, however, there is an error or omission, you should discuss the application with a manager or technical expert and consider contacting the applicant and/or their sponsor to ask them to provide additional evidence or information. See Evidential flexibility guidance</p>

<h3>Taking a fair and proportionate approach to assessment of evidence</h3>

<p>You must review the information on the application form and other available evidence before deciding whether you are satisfied on the balance of probabilities (it is more likely than not) a requirement is met.</p>

<p>If the evidence with the application is meant to show the requirement is met and you are not satisfied the evidence is genuine, you should consider the guidance on false representations and follow the minded to refuse process.</p>

<h3>Format of evidence</h3>

<p>The Immigration Rules no longer set out specific format requirements for most documents. This doesn’t mean format is irrelevant – it will help you assess if a piece of evidence is genuine and if it provides the information needed for you to be satisfied a requirement is met. You must not refuse an application because the evidence is not in a particular format, but you may request alternative or additional evidence or seek verification if you are not satisfied what the applicant (or their sponsor) has provided shows the requirements of the rules are met.</p>

<p>If evidence, such as a bank letter, does not include the information you would normally expect, you should consider whether to take further action to verify it.</p>

<h3>Where evidence is missing or inadequate</h3>

<p>The applicant will be told what evidence to provide as part of the application process. However, sometimes evidence is missing or inadequate to enable you to assess whether the requirement is met.</p>

<p>You should consider seeking further information or making verification checks when, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence is missing (for example a missing page from a series) and you believe the applicant has, or could obtain it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence is inadequate, but could be clarified, for example, if a letter from an official financial sponsor does not include all the information you would expect</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should check any discrepancies about information on the CoS with the sponsor.</p>

<p>You may decide to ask for further information from the applicant, sponsor, or issuing institution (for example, the bank which issued the applicant’s financial documents) or make verification checks in other cases if you think it would help assess whether the requirements are met. If you are not sure whether this would help, you should discuss this with a manager.</p>

<p>When contacting the applicant or sponsor, they should be given 10 UK working days in which to provide a response.</p>

<p>You do not need to contact the applicant or sponsor if evidence is missing or inadequate, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you do not need the information because you can find it elsewhere, for example, from the certificate of sponsorship</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>receiving it would make no difference to the decision (for example because you would still refuse the application for other reasons)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the evidence supplied is inadequate, you do not have to offer the applicant an opportunity to provide different evidence. For example, if the applicant provides bank statements and they do not show the required level of funds or the evidence is not sufficient, you do not need to check whether the applicant has another bank account which might meet the requirement.</p>

<h3>Failure to supply requested information</h3>

<p>If you request additional information from the applicant or their sponsor, you should ask them to provide it, or an explanation why they are unable to, within 10 working days of the date you send the request letter.</p>

<p>If you do not receive the requested information in this timeframe, you must assess whether any excuse provided is reasonable and if so, you should give the applicant more time to respond. If the applicant does not provide a reason or the reasons, they give are not satisfactory, you may refuse the application.</p>
