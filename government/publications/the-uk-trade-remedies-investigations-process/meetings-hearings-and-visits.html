<h2>Meeting us during an investigation or review</h2>

<p>Meetings are usually held between a single interested party or contributor and the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) case team. They may be held in person or virtually. The purpose of a meeting may vary depending on the needs of the case. They are an informal way for interested parties or contributors to discuss issues relating to an ongoing investigation and provide additional information to our investigations team. They can also be a useful way for interested parties and contributors to discuss confidential information with us on a one-to-one basis.</p>

<p>Meetings should be an opportunity for interested parties and contributors to put forward new information and not to repeat or emphasise information they have already provided to us. Interested parties and contributors are welcome to provide written statements at any time during the course of an investigation or review. Alternatively, meetings can be used to raise and discuss a specific issue (or issues) identified throughout the course of an investigation or review. They should not be used to ask for feedback on the progress of the case.</p>

<h3>If you want to request a meeting</h3>

<p>Only an interested party or contributor who has registered their interest on the Trade Remedies Service (TRS) can ask for a meeting with us about a case. You can find instructions on the TRS on how to do this. We handle each request on a case-by-case basis, as part of the ongoing investigation process.</p>

<p>If you ask us for a meeting, you should provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An agenda outlining what you want to discuss</li>
  <li>A clear explanation why you would like to meet with us</li>
</ul>

<p>We will publish your request for a meeting on our public file, along with other non-confidential information about the case. For this reason, if you include confidential material with your request, please also provide a non-confidential version. We will only publish the non-confidential version of the information you provide.</p>

<p>Only the interested party or contributor who requested the meeting can attend, unless otherwise agreed. We will contact you to arrange a suitable date, time and location for the meeting, and make any reasonable adjustments to help ensure you can attend.</p>

<h3>If we ask you to meet us</h3>

<p>We may ask an interested party or contributor to meet us. If we do, we will provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An agenda outlining what we want to discuss</li>
  <li>A clear explanation why we would like to meet with you</li>
</ul>

<p>As when you ask us for a meeting, we will publish our request on our public file. We will only publish a non-confidential version of the request. Only the interested party or contributor who we asked to meet can attend, unless otherwise agreed. We will contact you to arrange a suitable date, time and location (if the meeting will be in person) and make any reasonable adjustments to help ensure you can attend.</p>

<h3>Preparing for a meeting</h3>

<p>While meetings are an informal way to discuss the investigation with us, it is important to remember that if you want what you say to be taken into account in our investigation, you will need to provide a written version of any statements you make during the meeting, including any evidence you refer to.</p>

<p>All written submissions will be published on our public file so that other interested parties and contributors can view them. If you provide a written statement that contains any confidential information, you will also need to provide a non-confidential version.</p>

<h2>Hearings during an investigation or review</h2>

<p>A hearing is an opportunity for interested parties to meet with us and other interested parties and contributors during an ongoing investigation or review, to present their views and hear the views of others involved. It is not an opportunity to question the TRA about the investigation or review and decisions will not be made and/or disclosed during a hearing. Only interested parties and contributors who are registered on the TRS to the relevant investigation can attend hearings. They are not open to the public.</p>

<p>A hearing may be requested by an interested party (contributors can’t ask for hearings) or we may suggest one ourselves. The best time for a hearing, regardless of who proposes it, is generally once we have carried out evidence-gathering and analysis and published our initial report of our findings. In a dumping or subsidy case, this is called a Statement of Essential Facts (SEF), while in a safeguard investigation, it is called a Statement of Intended Final Determination (SIFD). If you would like to meet with us before this stage, we would encourage you to ask for a meeting with us.</p>

<p>The purpose of a hearing varies depending on the needs of the case. However, in general, hearings are a mechanism to discuss a specific issue (or issues) arising following publication of our initial report.</p>

<p>We will notify interested parties and contributors in advance to tell them about any specific processes and procedures that will be adopted at the hearing.</p>

<h2>Requesting a hearing</h2>

<p>If you are an interested party to the case, you can ask us to hold a hearing. You can find instructions on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a> on how to do this. We handle each request on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>You should provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A completed ‘request for hearing’ form (available on the TRS)</li>
  <li>An agenda outlining what you want to discuss</li>
  <li>Clear reasoning on the need for a hearing</li>
</ul>

<p>If you include confidential material with your request, please also provide a non-confidential version of this. We will publish the non-confidential version on our public file.</p>

<p>It is important to give clear reasoning about why a hearing is required and why you can’t simply provide information in written form. If you don’t provide this, we may ask you for further information. If we don’t receive this, or we don’t consider your reasoning to be sufficient justification for holding a hearing, we may reject the request. If we do, as an interested party, you can still provide a written response to our initial report.</p>

<p>When we arrange a hearing, we will give notice to all interested parties and contributors by publishing the request on our public file. We will only publish a non-confidential version of the information provided. We will arrange a date, time and location in consultation with all attendees and make any reasonable adjustments to help ensure individuals can attend. However, once a hearing has been agreed and scheduled, it is unlikely that we will be able to make any further changes to the arrangements.</p>

<p>Interested parties and contributors (or their representatives) are not under any obligation to attend a hearing, including hearings we initiate. If an interested party doesn’t attend a hearing, we won’t determine them to be non-cooperative as a result and their failure to attend will not be prejudicial to their interests.</p>

<h3>If we invite you to a hearing</h3>

<p>We may decide to conduct a hearing on our own initiative and ask interested parties and/or contributors to attend. If we do, we will provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An agenda outlining what we want to discuss</li>
  <li>Clear reasoning on the need for a hearing</li>
</ul>

<p>As when we receive a request for a hearing, we will publish our intention to hold a hearing on the public file. We will only publish a non-confidential version of this. We will give sufficient notice and propose a suitable date, time and location.</p>

<h3>Use of information at a hearing</h3>

<p>Because hearings may be attended by individuals representing many different companies and industries, anything said in a hearing must be considered public and cannot be treated as confidential. Any oral statements made at a hearing can only be taken into account in our investigation or review if a written version is provided.</p>

<p>If you make an oral statement at a hearing, you should provide a written version of that statement afterwards, via the Trade Remedies Service. It’s a good idea to prepare what you want to say beforehand in writing – this can form the basis of your written copy. You can include confidential information which you did not include in your oral statement.</p>

<p>All written statements will be published on the Trade Remedies Service so other interested parties and contributors can view them. For this reason, if your submission includes confidential information, please also provide a non-confidential version of your submission which we can publish.</p>

<h2>Industry visits</h2>

<p>When we receive an application from a UK industry for a new investigation or review, we may want to visit relevant UK industry premises to find out more about the industry, before we decide whether or not to initiate the investigation or review. The purpose of our visit will vary depending on the information provided in the application.</p>

<h3>Preparing for an industry visit</h3>

<p>If we decide to carry out an industry visit, we will contact the company in question to ask them to host a visit.  If they agree, we will arrange a suitable date for our visit and provide an agenda/itinerary outlining what we want to discuss or any elements of the manufacturing processes we want to view.  If a visit can’t be arranged, this won’t affect our decision on whether to initiate an investigation or review.</p>

<p>After a visit, we may ask the company we visited to provide us with further information, including any evidence they referred to during our visit. Once we have made a decision on whether or not to initiate the investigation or review, we will prepare a report of our visit and publish a non-confidential version of this on the public file.</p>
