<h3>Primary legislation in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (the Taxation Act)</h3>

<p>Paragraph 26 of Part 6 of Schedule 4 to the Taxation Act provides the basis for regulations about the suspension of anti-dumping or countervailing remedies.</p>

<p>Paragraph 24 of Part 5 of Schedule 5 to the Taxation Act provides the basis for regulations about the suspension of safeguarding measures.</p>

<h3>Secondary legislation in The Trade Remedies (Dumping and Subsidisation) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the D&amp;S Regs)</h3>

<p>Part 9 of the D&amp;S Regs describes the principles of how to investigate whether an anti-dumping or a countervailing remedy should be suspended. Specific provisions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what an application should contain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requirements for making a recommendation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making decisions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Secondary legislation in The Trade Remedies (Increase in Imports Causing Serious Injury to UK Producers) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the SG Regs)</h3>

<p>Part 7 of the SG Regulations describes the principles of how to investigate whether a safeguarding measure should be suspended. Specific provisions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what an application should contain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requirements for making a recommendation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making decisions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction to suspensions</h2>

<p>A suspension is the temporary halting of the application of a trade remedy measure. Whether or not as a consequence of considering an application by or on behalf of an interested party, the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) may recommend suspending anti-dumping, countervailing or safeguarding remedies on certain goods for a specified period. Recommendations to suspend a measure are made on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that (serious) injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of suspending the measure. Before making its recommendation, the TRA must give the UK industry opportunity to comment on the proposed suspension and these comments must be taken into account.</p>

<p>If the TRA recommends suspending a measure and the Secretary of State for International Trade accepts our recommendation, they will issue a notice to specify the length of time for which the measure will be suspended. The TRA will recommend a period of suspension of up to nine months. Following an application by an interested party (or where the TRA considers that it is appropriate), the TRA may recommend extending the period of suspension to a maximum of 21 months.</p>

<h2>Applying for a suspension</h2>

<p>Interested parties or those acting on behalf of interested parties can apply for a trade remedy measure to be suspended through our Trade Remedies Service.</p>

<p>An interested party is an organisation which is directly connected with the goods covered by the measure – for example, an importer or exporters of the goods, a trade association, or a UK producer of goods like those covered by the measure.</p>

<p>You will need to be able to demonstrate that market conditions have changed for the goods which the measure covers. You will also need to be able to show that the change is temporary and provide evidence of the effect this is having on UK producers.</p>

<p>If an application doesn’t contain sufficient evidence that the measure should be suspended or it has not been submitted to us via the Trade Remedies Service, we may reject the application and we will notify the applicant to explain this.</p>

<h2>Our investigation process</h2>

<p>The purpose of a suspension investigation is to examine whether the TRA is satisfied that a suspension is appropriate.</p>

<p>If we consider that the relevant circumstances exist, we will initiate an investigation. We will publish a Notice of Initiation through the Trade Remedies Service and notify UK industry to allow them to comment on the suspension proposed.</p>

<p>During our investigation, we will assess whether market conditions have temporarily changed. If the application relates to an anti-dumping or a countervailing measure, we will assess whether as a consequence of the change in market conditions, injury would be likely to recur if the measure were suspended. If the suspension application is about a safeguarding measure, we will assess whether serious injury would recur.</p>

<h2>Making our recommendation</h2>

<p>Once we have carried out our investigation, we will decide whether to make a suspension recommendation to the Secretary of State for International Trade.</p>

<p>If we make a recommendation, we will specify a time period for the suspension.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State will then give effect to our recommendation by issuing a public notice, unless they decide that it is not in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>If we recommend that the measure should not be suspended, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>publish a notice explaining the reasons; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>notify the Secretary of State and interested parties</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we subsequently determine that the grounds on which a measure was suspended no longer exist, we may make a recommendation to the Secretary of State to reinstate the measure.</p>
