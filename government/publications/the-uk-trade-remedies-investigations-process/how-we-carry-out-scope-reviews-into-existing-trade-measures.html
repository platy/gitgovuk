<h4>Primary legislation in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (the Taxation Act)</h4>

<p>Paragraph 21(3)(f) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/22/schedule/4/enacted" rel="external">Schedule 4 to the Taxation Act</a> provides the basis for regulations about scope reviews.</p>

<h4>Secondary legislation in The Trade Remedies (Dumping and Subsidisation) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the D&amp;S Regs)</h4>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/450/part/7/made" rel="external">Part 7 of the D&amp;S Regs</a> describes the principles of how reviews should be conducted. Within this, Regulation 74 contains specific provisions for scope reviews. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what an application should contain</li>
  <li>requirements for initiation</li>
  <li>making preliminary decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation 99A(2) also makes it clear that we can conduct scope reviews for measures transitioned from the European Union.</p>

<h2>Introduction to scope reviews</h2>

<p>When we investigate a trade practice such as the dumping or subsidising of imported goods, we may recommend a trade remedies measure to counteract it. The notice which announces this measure will specify the description of the goods to which the measure will apply. This is designed to make sure that the right goods are covered.</p>

<p>If it subsequently emerges that other products which are being imported under similar circumstances may need to be covered by the measure – or that products which are currently covered by the measure may need to be removed from the description of the goods – we may carry out a scope review.</p>

<p>We carry out a scope review based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an application by or on behalf of an interested party or</li>
  <li>our own initiative</li>
</ul>

<p>We may decide to carry out a scope review on our own initiative if we have sufficient evidence that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at present, products could fall under the original scope which were not originally intended to be covered by the measure</li>
  <li>a product which was covered within the original scope is not produced in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>We can do this at any time after a measure is put in place. Alternatively, an interested party may apply for a scope review into a certain measure – however, they can only do this once at least a year has passed since the measure was first imposed (or altered).</p>

<p>Please note that if we conduct a transition review of a measure, we will consider whether the measure’s scope is appropriate. This means that for measures transitioned from the EU, a transition review should fulfil the role of a scope review in the first instance.</p>

<h2>Applying for a scope review</h2>

<p>Interested parties can apply for a scope review of an existing trade remedy measure by completing the form on our online Trade Remedies Service.</p>

<p>The application should explain what imported product the applicant considers should be included in or removed from the scope of a measure. It must include evidence that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the scope of the measure should be changed</li>
  <li>this change does not justify a separate dumping or subsidy investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>The application should be submitted through our online Trade Remedies Service. We will then assess it to decide whether to initiate a scope review.</p>

<h2>How we assess an application for a scope review</h2>

<p>To determine whether we should initiate a scope review, we will consider the goods concerned in our original investigation, the goods described in the application for a scope review (the goods subject to review) and similar UK products.</p>

<p>In particular, we will look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether we would have included the goods subject to review in the scope of the original investigation if the relevant information had been available at that time</li>
  <li>the relationship between the goods subject to review and those which are covered by the original measure (the goods concerned) in the UK market (e.g. are they directly competitive, do they have a similar end-use etc)</li>
  <li>the estimated effect any change in scope would have on the intended effects of the measure</li>
  <li>whether the change in scope could affect the interests of any interested party or contributor</li>
  <li>whether the issues raised in the application could be resolved by applying customs rules to the goods instead</li>
  <li>any other factors we consider relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>When we decide to initiate a scope review, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish a notice of initiation through our online service</li>
  <li>notify interested parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rejecting a scope review application</h2>
<p>If an application does not meet the requirements for initiating a scope review, we will reject it and notify the applicant accordingly.</p>

<p>Other situations where we may reject an application for a scope review include where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application relates to a temporary change in circumstances rather than a long-lasting one</li>
  <li>we have already conducted a review (or rejected a previous review application) relating to a similar issue and circumstances have not changed since then</li>
  <li>information the application relies on could have been provided to us in the original investigation or a previous review</li>
  <li>the applicant has not followed procedural requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>When we reject a scope review application, we will notify the applicant, setting out the reasons for our decision.</p>

<h2>Our scope review process</h2>

<h3>How you can take part in a scope review</h3>

<p>Once we publish our Notice of Initiation of a new scope review, interested parties and contributors can contact us within an agreed period to register their interest in the review. They should do this through our online Trade Remedies Service.</p>

<p>To help us carry out our review, we will send a questionnaire to interested parties and contributors who register their interest to gather information about the goods. The difference between interested parties and contributors is set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process">investigation process guidance</a>.</p>

<p>We may also want to visit the premises of those interested parties which are businesses directly affected and whose data is directly relevant to our review to familiarise ourselves with their industry and products or to verify data submitted during the review process, including questionnaires and the application. When we do this, we will discuss this in advance to explain the need for the visit and agree a convenient date and time.</p>

<h3>How we will determine whether the scope of a measure should change</h3>

<p>We will base our decision on information obtained through questionnaires, visits and any other sources we consider relevant. The precise factors we consider will vary for each scope review.</p>

<p>We will generally consider differences and similarities between the goods covered by the current measure and the goods we are assessing in our review, based on the following non-exhaustive criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical, chemical and technical characteristics</li>
  <li>production processes</li>
  <li>typical end-uses</li>
  <li>interchangeability</li>
</ul>

<p>When we decide whether goods in a review should now be included in a measure’s scope, we will generally also look at whether they were taken into account when we were calculating dumping, injury or subsidy margins in the original investigation or in a previous review.</p>

<p>When we are determining whether goods which are currently included in the scope of the measure should now be excluded, we will generally also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the domestic industry sells goods which are like or directly competitive goods to the goods subject to review (for more information on like goods, see our investigation process guidance; for directly competitive goods, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-carry-out-a-safeguards-investigation">our safeguards guidance</a>
</li>
  <li>whether the amended scope could be applied in practice in terms of customs and tariffs</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also take into account any other factor we consider relevant, depending on the circumstances of the review. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether there are domestic producers of the goods subject to review</li>
  <li>competition between the goods subject to review and the goods concerned in our original investigation</li>
  <li>channels of distribution and sale of the goods subject to review</li>
  <li>the packaging of the goods subject to review, including any other goods contained in the packaging</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting our conclusions</h2>

<p>Once we have carried out our scope review, we will make a recommendation on whether the scope of a measure should be changed or kept the same.</p>

<h3>Making our Statement of Essential Facts</h3>

<p>We will publish a Statement of Essential Facts through our online Trade Remedies Service which will set out our recommendation, a summary of the facts we have considered during our review and how we have used these facts to reach our decision.</p>

<p>We will inform interested parties and invite them to comment and provide evidence on the statement within an agreed period. We will then consider these comments before reaching our final decision.</p>

<p>At this point, we will also contact interested parties to explain how their information was used. We will include details of the assessment which formed the basis for our recommendation.</p>

<h3>Making our recommendation to the Secretary of State</h3>

<p>Following this process, we will make our recommendation to the Secretary of State for International Trade, who will then decide whether to give effect to it.</p>

<p>If we recommend maintaining the description of goods within the scope of the measure as it currently stands and the Secretary of State gives effect to this, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terminate the review</li>
  <li>publish a termination notice</li>
  <li>notify interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>If we recommend changing the description of goods within the scope of the measure, the Secretary of State will give effect to this unless they are satisfied that it is not in the public interest to do so. Interested parties will then be notified of this decision.</p>
