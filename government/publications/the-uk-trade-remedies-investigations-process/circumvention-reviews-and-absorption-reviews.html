<h2>Introduction to circumvention reviews and absorption reviews</h2>

<p>This guidance covers two separate types of reviews:</p>

<ul>
  <li>circumvention reviews</li>
  <li>absorption reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>A circumvention review investigates whether the company’s activity is being undertaken to avoid a duty put in place as part of a trade remedies measure.</p>

<p>An absorption review investigates whether export prices of the goods have fallen or have not increased enough, so the measure does not have its intended effect.</p>

<p>Circumvention reviews apply to both anti-dumping and countervailing measures. Absorption reviews can only be initiated for anti-dumping measures.</p>

<h3>Applying to us to carry out a circumvention or absorption review</h3>

<p>An application for either a circumvention review or an absorption review can be made by, or on behalf of, an interested party (whether or not they were involved in the original investigation), or we may decide to undertake a review ourselves. If we receive an application for a circumvention or absorption review on a measure that was transitioned when the UK left the customs union but for which we have not yet carried out a transition review, we will consider whether it would be appropriate to undertake the transition review at the same time as the circumvention and/or absorption review.</p>

<p>All applications should be submitted online through the Trade Remedies Service. You will need to set out clearly what type of review you are applying for. Your application must include evidence that a trade remedy measure is being or has been circumvented (for a circumvention review) or absorbed (for an absorption review), including a detailed description of how this is happening, who is involved and the effect on the original measure. We will then assess the application and decide whether to initiate a review.</p>

<h3>Initiating a circumvention or absorption review when no application has been made</h3>

<p>If we think it is necessary, we may initiate a circumvention or absorption review on our own initiative.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we may initiate an absorption review if, during the course of an investigation (including a transition review), we find evidence of companies avoiding or absorbing the anti-dumping duty</li>
  <li>we may initiate a circumvention review if  we identify a change in the trade flows of the goods subject to the measure and we have reason to believe this is caused by an attempt to circumvent the measure</li>
</ul>

<p>We can initiate a circumvention or absorption review at any time after a measure has been imposed.</p>

<p>When we decide to initiate the review, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish a Notice of Initiation</li>
  <li>notify interested parties via our online Trade Remedies Service</li>
</ul>

<p>If the review relates to subsidised goods, we will also notify the government of the exporting country or territory.</p>

<h3>Why we may not accept a review application</h3>

<p>If an application doesn’t contain sufficient evidence to support the allegation or it has not been submitted to us via the Trade Remedies Service, we may reject the application and notify the applicant to explain this.</p>

<p>We may also reject an application for other reasons, for example if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application relates to a temporary change in circumstances relating to the allegation</li>
  <li>we have already conducted a review or rejected a previous review application relating to a similar issue and circumstances have not changed in the meantime</li>
  <li>the information on which the application relies could have been provided to us in the original investigation or a previous review or rejection of a previous review</li>
  <li>or the review applicant has not complied with procedural requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our process for carrying out absorption and circumvention reviews</h2>

<h3>How you can take part</h3>

<p>Once we publish our Notice of Initiation, interested parties and contributors can contact us within an agreed period to register their interest in the review. You can register through our online Trade Remedies Service. We may ask you to complete a questionnaire to gather information to help us in our review.</p>

<p>We may also visit the premises of interested parties to familiarise ourselves with the industry and products covered by the measure, or to verify data submitted during the review process. When we do this, we will contact the organisation we intend to visit beforehand to discuss the proposed date and time for the visit, its nature and purpose and any other relevant information we may need.</p>

<h2>Circumvention reviews</h2>

<h3>How we determine if a measure is being or has been circumvented</h3>

<p>We will assess information received from questionnaires, during visits and from other appropriate sources to determine if circumvention exists. We will consider a number of questions, including but not limited to the following points.</p>

<h4>Has there been a change in the pattern of trade of the goods named in the measure?</h4>

<p>A change in the pattern of trade can cover a wide range of situations in which sales, shipment or the assembly of the goods or related goods are varied. This could be either between a third country not listed in the original notice and the UK or between individual companies in the country of origin and the UK.</p>

<h4>What are the reasons for any change in the pattern of trade?</h4>

<p>For example, has there been a change in the way the goods are shipped so that they are transported via a company or a country that has not been subject to the measure? Or have minor changes been made to the product so that it is still essentially the same but no longer subject to the duty?</p>

<h4>Is there injury to UK industry, or is the ability of the duty to remedy the unfair trading practice being undermined?</h4>

<p>For example, if the original measure was an anti-dumping duty, we might consider if there has been price undercutting.</p>

<h3>Absorption reviews</h3>

<h4>How we determine if a measure is being or has been absorbed</h4>

<p>We will assess information received from questionnaires, during visits and from other appropriate sources to determine if absorption exists.</p>

<p>We will consider a number of questions, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>has the anti-dumping duty had the desired effect, for example to remove injury?
have export prices of the goods decreased or increased less than would be expected, given the measure?
are there other factors (such as a lower raw material costs) that can explain the lower resale price?</p>

<h2>Concluding a circumvention or absorption review</h2>

<h3>Possible outcomes</h3>

<p>When we conclude a circumvention or absorption review, we may determine that:</p>

<p>the current anti-dumping or countervailing duty should remain unchanged
or the duty imposed should be varied</p>

<p>If we recommend that the duty should be varied, the variation can be applied to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some or all goods subject to the review</li>
  <li>goods from a third country</li>
  <li>in circumvention reviews only, the variation can be applied to additional exporters or importers (where a reorganisation of exporting patterns and channels of sales means that the duty should also apply to them)</li>
</ul>

<p>We may grant an exemption from the measure(s) to either importers or exporters under certain conditions as set out in the legislation.</p>

<p>We will not re-assess the economic interest test for either an absorption review or a circumvention review.</p>

<h3>Our Statement of Essential Facts</h3>

<p>Once we have completed our review, we will publish a Statement of Essential Facts setting out the detailed reasoning of how we came to our decision.</p>

<p>We will inform interested parties and invite them to comment and provide supporting evidence within an agreed period. We will then consider these comments before making our final determination.</p>

<h3>The final determination</h3>

<p>If we recommend maintaining the original measure and the Secretary of State gives effect to this, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terminate the review</li>
  <li>publish a termination notice</li>
  <li>notify interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>If we recommend varying the measure, the Secretary of State will give effect to this by issuing a public notice, unless they are satisfied that it is not in the public interest to do so.</p>
