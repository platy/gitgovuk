<h2>What is dumping?</h2>

<p>Dumping occurs when goods are imported into a country and sold at a price that is below their normal value in their country of export. An anti-dumping remedy may be needed if the dumping causes or threatens material injury to a domestic industry or makes it more difficult for one to be established.</p>

<p>If we find dumped imports that are causing injury to UK industry during our investigation, then (subject to the other requirements of the investigation) we will recommend anti-dumping measures to counter the effects of this unfair trade practice.</p>

<p>When we undertake dumping investigations, we calculate dumping margins for each exporter sampled as part of our work to assess whether the dumped imports have caused material injury. The dumping margin is the difference between the export price and the normal value of the goods being dumped, described as a percentage of the export price. We then use the dumping margin along with the injury margin to set anti-dumping duty rates where they are needed. This chapter describes how we calculate the dumping margins.</p>

<h3>World Trade Organization (WTO) – relevant provisions</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/19-adp_01_e.htm#ArticleII" rel="external">Article 2</a> of the Anti-Dumping Agreement (ADA) provides guidance on calculating dumping margins.</p>

<h2>How we calculate a dumping margin for an exporter</h2>

<p>Calculating a dumping margin involves the following stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculating the normal value of the goods concerned</li>
  <li>determining the export price</li>
  <li>ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price</li>
  <li>calculating the dumping margins</li>
</ul>

<p>The calculation process involves reviewing data associated with the goods concerned in the investigation. These goods are described fully in the Notice of Initiation we issue at the beginning of an investigation. We give goods in our investigations Product Control Numbers (PCNs) which are identifiers unique to our work and are created on the basis of the main characteristics differentiating the goods from other goods. We use PCNs to allow comparison between products made by domestic and foreign producers.</p>

<h2>Calculating the normal value based on comparable price</h2>

<p>Where possible, we will calculate the normal value of the goods which are suspected of having been dumped (the goods concerned in the investigation) using the comparable price. This is the price of the goods or like goods in the ordinary course of trade in the home market of the exporting country.</p>

<p>Like goods are defined as goods which are similar to the goods concerned in the dumping investigation in all respects or have characteristics which closely resemble them. In identifying like goods, we will consider the following non-exhaustive list of criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical likeness, such as physical characteristics</li>
  <li>commercial likeness, including competition and distribution channels</li>
  <li>functional likeness, such as end-use or if the goods can be substituted for each other</li>
  <li>similarities in production, such as method and inputs</li>
  <li>other relevant characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determining when not to use comparable price</h2>

<p>We won’t base the normal value of the imported goods on comparable price if we think it is not appropriate to do so.</p>

<p>This applies to situations where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there are no sales of like goods in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country</li>
  <li>
    <p>these sales don’t allow a proper comparison with the goods concerned because of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a particular market situation</li>
      <li>low volume of sales in the domestic market of the exporting country</li>
      <li>the overseas exporter does not sell like goods in their domestic market</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sales of like goods in the exporter’s home market</h3>

<p>We won’t use comparable price to calculate the normal value of the goods if the exporter does not sell goods domestically which are identical to or closely resemble the goods they export to the UK.</p>

<h3>Particular market situation</h3>

<p>We won’t use comparable price to calculate the normal value of the goods where, because of a particular market situation in the exporting country, such sales do not allow a proper comparison between the like goods and the goods concerned. This may be, for example, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prices are artificially low</li>
  <li>there is significant barter trade</li>
  <li>prices reflect non-commercial factors</li>
</ul>

<p>This could also include government interventions affecting the sales price of the goods concerned or the upstream or downstream markets.</p>

<p>We will assess whether a particular market situation is present on a case-by-case basis. We will examine whether there is a particular market situation in a country if sufficient relevant evidence arises which makes it necessary or appropriate for us to do so.</p>

<h3>Where there is a low volume of sales</h3>

<p>We won’t use comparable price to calculate the normal value of the goods concerned if, due to a low volume of sales, this does not allow a proper comparison between the like goods and the goods concerned.  We consider domestic sales to be in sufficient volume to allow a proper comparison where they make up at least 5% of the overseas exporter’s UK sales volume. In some cases, however, we may consider the volume of sales is sufficient even where they make up less than 5% of the exporter’s UK sales volume. We will review this on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>We will only include sales destined for consumption on the exporter’s domestic market when we are assessing sufficient volume of sales. If goods are destined for export markets, we will exclude these sales from our domestic sales analysis.</p>

<p>We may also make an exception for captive sales (sales made between associated companies for further processing, transformation or assembly). In general, we will not consider these sales as destined for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting country, so we will exclude them from our sales volume analysis. However, if the exporter shows that these sales were in the ordinary course of trade, we will include them in our sales volume analysis.</p>

<h3>If sales are not in the ordinary course of trade</h3>

<p>We won’t use comparable sales if the sales in question are not in the ordinary course of trade. There are many situations where this may apply. The two most common situations are where goods are sold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at prices below per unit costs</li>
  <li>between parties we consider to be associated, unless exporters show us that the association does not affect prices</li>
</ul>

<p>We consider sales below cost to be sale prices that are below the per unit cost of production, including admin, selling and general costs. We will only consider sales below cost as not in the ordinary course of trade where they meet three conditions. These are that sales are made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within an extended period of time (normally one year or at least six months)</li>
  <li>in substantial quantities</li>
  <li>at prices which do not include the recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time</li>
</ul>

<p>We consider sales below cost to be in substantial quantities where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the weighted average selling price per PCN is below the weighted average per unit cost</li>
  <li>the volume of sales below cost represents 20% or more of the volume sold in the relevant transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>If we conclude that an exporter’s below cost sales fit either of these descriptions, we may disregard all or some of these sales when we are calculating normal value for the goods concerned in the investigation.</p>

<p>In general, we will consider sales to associated parties as not being in the ordinary course of trade. However, if parties provide sufficient evidence that the association does not affect prices and we accept this, we may then include these sales within our comparable price assessment.</p>

<p>We consider parties to be ‘associated’ when they meet the definition of ‘related persons’ in Regulation 128 of The Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (a).</p>

<h3>Sequencing</h3>

<p>In general, we will assess each of these conditions for using comparable price in a default order</p>

<h2>Alternative methods to determine the normal value</h2>

<p>When we can’t use comparable price, we will use alternative methods to determine the normal value of the goods concerned.</p>

<p>In general, this alternative method will be either constructed normal value or representative export sales prices to an appropriate third country.</p>

<p>We may also determine normal value based on other exporters’ domestic sales if the exporter does not sell like goods domestically. This is sometimes known as the ‘exporter next door’ method.</p>

<p>Finally, further alternative methods for determining normal value are available for imports from particular foreign countries.</p>

<h3>Using a constructed normal value</h3>

<p>For the goods concerned, we will construct the normal value by adding together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Costs of Production (CoP)</li>
  <li>a reasonable amount for administrative, selling and general (AS&amp;G) costs and profits</li>
</ul>

<p>We will normally calculate CoP based on the exporter’s records. We will do this if those records:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporter’s country</li>
  <li>reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the like goods in the exporter’s country</li>
</ul>

<p>If an exporter’s records do not meet either of these conditions, we may calculate CoP on another reasonable basis.</p>

<p>When we determine CoP, we will consider all the evidence we have access to about the proper allocation of costs. We will consider allocations that have been used historically by the exporter and we will establish appropriate amortisation and depreciation periods. We will also establish allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs. If appropriate, we will adjust costs for non-recurring items or costs which benefit future and/or current production. We will also adjust costs affected by start-up operations and any other factors we consider relevant.</p>

<p>Once we have arrived at a cost of production for the goods concerned, we will calculate AS&amp;G costs and profit. We can do this based on actual data from the exporter if these records relate to the production and sale of the goods concerned in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country.</p>

<p>However, if we find that an exporter’s records do not meet these conditions, we may calculate AS&amp;G costs and profit based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actual costs incurred by the overseas exporter for producing and selling the same general category of goods in their domestic market</li>
  <li>the weighted average of AS&amp;G costs incurred by other overseas exporters we’re investigating for production and sales of the like goods in their domestic market</li>
  <li>any other reasonable method, as long as the amount we determine for profit is not more than the profit normally realised by other overseas exporters for sales of the same general category of goods in their domestic market</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adjusting costs in order to accurately construct normal value</h4>

<p>When we are constructing normal value, we may adjust certain costs or profit if they are unrepresentative. This applies where they do not reasonably reflect what they would be in their domestic market if they were substantially determined by market forces. We will only adjust significant cost or profit elements.</p>

<p>When we make these adjustments, we may base our calculation on the costs or profits in an appropriate third country or on international prices, costs or benchmarks. When we use figures from a third country, we will consider whether it has a similar level of economic development. Where appropriate, we will adjust third country data or benchmarks to reflect circumstances in the exporting country. For example, this may include differing transport costs. When choosing an appropriate third country to source data from, we may also take into account whether exporters in that country make reliable information available to us or any other factors we consider relevant.</p>

<h3>Determining normal value based on export prices to an appropriate third country</h3>

<p>In some cases, we may determine normal value based on the price of the exporter’s goods when they are exported to an appropriate third country. We will only do this if the price is representative. We will also consider whether the exporter’s volumes of trade to the third country and the UK are sufficiently similar and whether these sales are made in the ordinary course of trade.</p>

<h3>Determining normal value based on domestic sales of other exporters (exporter next door)</h3>

<p>We can only determine normal value based on other exporters’ domestic sales in the exporting country where the exporter of the goods in question does not sell like goods domestically.</p>
