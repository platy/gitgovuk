<h2>Definition of a new exporter</h2>
<p>A new exporter is an overseas exporter that has started (or will soon start) to export a good into the UK which is subject to an existing anti-dumping or countervailing measure. An exporter will be considered ‘new’ if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they did not export the good into the UK during the period of investigation used to establish the anti-dumping or countervailing amount in the original investigation</li>
  <li>they are not related to any other exporters that are subject to the anti-dumping or countervailing amount or that exported the good during the period of investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>An exporter who is already subject to an anti-dumping or countervailing measure will be considered as related to another exporter who did export the goods into the UK during the period of investigation. The exporter will not therefore be treated as a new exporter, even where those exports were made into the EU.</p>

<p>The period of investigation is a specific time period for which industry data is collected and analysed, normally the 12-month period before the date of initiation of a dumping or subsidy investigation. Further guidance on the period of investigation can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process">UK Trade Remedies Investigation Process Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The good(s) subject to review refers to the good or goods that the new exporter is exporting to the UK, which are already subject to an anti-dumping or countervailing amount established in a previous investigation.</p>

<h2>Initiating a new exporter review</h2>

<p>We will initiate a new exporter review when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we have received a review application from or on behalf of a new exporter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we are satisfied that the review application contains sufficient information to substantiate the need for a review</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Content of a review application</h3>

<p>An application for a new exporter review must include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence that the review applicant is not related to any overseas exporter:
    <ul>
      <li>who is subject to an anti-dumping or countervailing amount in respect of the dumped goods or subsidised imports</li>
      <li>who exported the dumped goods or subsidised imports to the UK during the period of investigation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>evidence that the review applicant did not export the goods subject to review to the UK during the period of investigation</li>
  <li>evidence that the review applicant:
    <ul>
      <li>is currently exporting the goods subject to review to the UK</li>
      <li>has a contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of the goods subject to review to the UK</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During the review we may calculate a new anti-dumping or countervailing amount. Therefore, the review applicant may also need to provide information that will be used to calculate an individual dumping or subsidy margin.</p>

<h3>Application assessment</h3>

<p>Once we have received an application for a new exporter review, we will assess whether it meets the requirements for us to initiate a review. Further information on what can be considered sufficient evidence in an application can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/the-trid-pre-application-office">application assessment guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Rejecting an application for a new exporter review</h3>
<p>We may reject a review application if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application does not contain sufficient evidence to substantiate the need for a review</li>
  <li>the application relates to a change in circumstances that is not of a lasting nature</li>
  <li>the application contains information which could have been provided in the original investigation or a previous review
*the applicant has not complied with the procedural requirements</li>
  <li>the application is not made via the Trade Remedies Service. 
If we have conducted a previous review or rejected a previous review application relating to the same anti-dumping or countervailing measures, we may reject another review application if:</li>
  <li>the application relates to matters which are like those set out in the previous review or review application</li>
  <li>there is no change of circumstances since the termination of the previous review or rejection of the previous review application. 
In all cases, if we decide to reject a review application, we will notify the applicant via the Trade Remedies Service.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initiating a New Exporter Review</h3>

<p>Where an application meets the requirements, we will accept the application and initiate the review. 
For reviews relating to dumping or subsidy investigations, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish a notice of the decision to initiate a review</li>
  <li>notify interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>For reviews relating to dumping investigations, we will issue a public notice to suspend the collection of any anti-dumping amount for the review applicant’s goods pending the outcome of the new exporter review.</p>

<p>For reviews relating to subsidy investigations, we will notify the government of the exporting country or territory prior to the initiation of the review.</p>

<p>Determinations following new exporter reviews should be made within 6 months from initiation. We aim to make a determination no later than 9 months after initiation.</p>

<p>If we receive an application for a new exporter review on a measure that was transitioned when the UK left the customs union but for which we have not yet carried out a transition review, we will consider whether it would be appropriate to undertake the transition review at the same time as the new exporter review.</p>

<h2>Outcomes of a new exporter review</h2>

<h4>Determining whether applicant is a new exporter</h4>

<p>Based on the information provided by the applicant and through our own data-gathering and analysis, we will determine whether the applicant meets the criteria for being a new exporter.</p>

<h4>Applicant is determined not to be a new exporter</h4>

<p>This means there will be no change to the anti-dumping or countervailing amount applied to the applicant’s exports. In this case, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>terminate the review</li>
  <li>publish a notice of termination</li>
  <li>notify interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>For reviews relating to a dumping investigation, we will apply the residual amount of duty owed from the date of initiation of the review, based on the existing anti-dumping amount.</p>

<h4>Applicant is determined to be a new exporter</h4>

<p>This means that there may be a change in the anti-dumping or countervailing amount applied to the applicant’s exports.</p>

<p>For reviews relating to dumping investigations, we will apply the amount of duty owed from the date of initiation of the review, when the duty was suspended, based on the newly determined anti-dumping amount.</p>

<h3>Deciding on the duty amount to apply</h3>

<h4>Original investigation used sampling</h4>

<p>If the original investigation used sampling of overseas exporters, then we will apply the duty rate for all non-sampled cooperating exporters from the original investigation to the new exporter. This will be the weighted average of the rates for the sampled co-operating exporters. Further guidance on sampling in an investigation can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/an-introduction-to-our-investigations-process">investigation process guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Original investigation did not use sampling</h4>

<p>If the original investigation did not use sampling of overseas exporters, then we will calculate and apply an individual anti-dumping or countervailing amount for the new exporter in question.</p>

<h3>Calculating an individual duty amount</h3>

<h4>Anti-dumping amounts</h4>

<p>To establish an individual anti-dumping amount, we will calculate the dumping margin for the new exporter. We will use the same methodology that we used when we calculated the dumping amount during the original investigation.</p>

<p>For more information on how we calculate anti-dumping amounts, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-carry-out-a-dumping-investigation">guidance on dumping methodology</a>.</p>

<h4>Countervailing amounts</h4>

<p>To establish an individual countervailing amount, we will determine the amount of subsidy that can be attributed to the subsidised imports from the new exporter.</p>

<p>For more information on how we calculate countervailing amounts, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-carry-out-a-subsidy-investigation">subsidy guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>For anti-dumping or countervailing amounts</h4>

<p>After establishing a dumping or subsidy margin, we will then apply the lesser duty rule. This means the anti-dumping or countervailing amount will be equal to whichever is the lower: the new exporter’s dumping or subsidy margin or the injury margin.</p>

<h3>Undertakings</h3>

<p>Where we have determined an individual dumping or countervailing amount, the new exporter may offer an undertaking.  The undertaking can take different forms, such as the new exporter agreeing to revise the prices or limit the quantities of its exports to the UK. A decision on whether to accept an undertaking is taken by the Secretary of State.</p>
