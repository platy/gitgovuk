<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/ai17_e/gatt1994_art19_gatt47.pdf" rel="external">The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)</a> provides further guidance on the use of safeguard measures in Article XIX (Emergency Action on Imports of Particular Products) and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/25-safeg_e.htm" rel="external">Agreement on Safeguards</a>. We must keep in mind international arrangements which the UK is a party to and this includes WTO rules.</p>

<h2>Safeguard investigation methodology</h2>

<h3>What are safeguards?</h3>

<p>A safeguard measure temporarily restricts imports of specified goods to help domestic industries adapt to new or temporary market conditions. A safeguard measure may be applied in situations where there has been an unforeseen surge in imports which has caused or is causing serious injury to domestic industry. A safeguard measure must be applied in a non-discriminatory way. In other words, it must be applied to all imports of the product in question regardless of their origins, although this is subject to certain exemptions, e.g. those from developing countries.</p>

<p>When an industry submits an application for a safeguard investigation, we may investigate whether a new safeguard measure is needed. The application will need to come from UK producers of like goods or goods that are directly competitive to the goods being imported. Like goods are defined as being similar in all respects to or with characteristics closely resembling those of the goods concerned in the investigation.</p>

<h3>Conditions under which a new safeguard measure may be imposed</h3>

<p>The four main conditions for imposing a new safeguard measure are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods in question are being imported into the UK in increased quantities</li>
  <li>serious injury is being or will be suffered by UK producers</li>
  <li>the imports have caused/are causing the serious injury</li>
  <li>the economic interest test is met</li>
</ul>

<h4>The goods in question are being imported into the UK in increased quantities</h4>
<p>We need to determine whether the goods concerned have been or are being imported into the UK in increased quantities. What ‘increased quantities’ means in this context is explained below. It involves a three-step analysis which examines whether there are increased quantities of imports, whether the increased quantities are significant and whether the increase was foreseeable.</p>

<h4>Increased quantities of imports during the period of investigation</h4>

<p>We will examine import data over a certain period (our period of investigation). We have the discretion to decide the length of this period and we will ensure it is long enough to provide sufficient data to assess whether a surge of imports has occurred. We will consider the trend in imports during the entire investigation period, especially the recent past. We will aim for the end point to be as close as is practicable to the date of initiation.</p>

<p>To determine whether the goods concerned are being imported into the UK in increased volumes, we must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether there has been an absolute increase in the volume of the goods concerned being imported into the UK</li>
  <li>whether there has been a relative increase in volume compared with the total UK production of like goods and directly competitive goods</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless we make a decision to exempt specific countries, we must consider imports of the goods concerned from all foreign countries and territories.</p>

<p>Once we have determined that there has been an increase in the volume of imports of the goods concerned into the UK, we must determine whether the increase is significant.</p>

<h4>Significant increase in the imports of the goods concerned</h4>

<p>We must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rate and volume of imports of the goods concerned into the UK</li>
  <li>foreseeability</li>
  <li>any other factors we consider relevant</li>
</ul>

<h4>Foreseeability</h4>

<p>To decide whether it was possible to foresee the increase in imports, we will establish whether it was a result of unexpected developments. To make this assessment, we may examine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes in patterns of demand for the goods concerned in the period of investigation and for like goods and directly competitive goods which are produced in the UK</li>
  <li>global over-capacity or increases in production capacity of the goods concerned</li>
  <li>economic or political crises</li>
  <li>any other factors we consider relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>If we find that the increase in imports was foreseeable, we won’t consider it to be significant for the purposes of our analysis.</p>

<h4>Serious injury is being or will be suffered by UK producers</h4>

<p>For a safeguard measure to be appropriate, the UK producers who apply to us to carry out an investigation must produce like goods or directly competitive goods to the goods being imported. Their production output must make up the whole or a major proportion of the UK’s production of these goods. Their position must be significantly impaired by the surge of imports, or at imminent risk of being significantly impaired.</p>

<p>Our injury determination will reflect the data we have gathered on UK producers. The number of UK producers in safeguard cases is likely to be more than in a dumping or subsidy case since the investigation takes into consideration producers of directly competitive goods as well as those of like goods.</p>

<p>Serious injury is defined as being when there is a significant overall impairment (or the threat of it), to UK producers of like or directly competitive goods. There is no minimum requirement for how long this needs to have been the case.</p>

<p>We will base our assessment of whether there is injury on a number of factors.</p>

<p>These will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rate and volume of increase in the imports of the goods concerned into the UK, in absolute or relative terms</li>
  <li>the export capacity of the goods concerned in their country or countries of export and the likelihood that this capacity will be exported to the UK</li>
  <li>the share of the domestic market in the UK taken by the increased imports</li>
  <li>changes in UK producers’ levels of sales, productivity, production, capacity use, profits and losses, and employment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Looking at causation and non-attribution where we find injury</h4>

<p>We will then carry out causation and non-attribution analysis. We do this in order to determine if the effects caused by any of the other factors are significant enough to break the causal link between increased imports and any serious injury.</p>

<p>We may consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the volume effects of the increased import of the goods concerned during the period of investigation</li>
  <li>the effect on prices in the UK market for like goods and directly competitive goods during the period of investigation, including depression and/or suppression of price increases</li>
  <li>any other issues we think are relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>We must consider whether any known factors other than the goods concerned have caused or are causing the serious injury to UK producers. We must not attribute the serious injury to the goods concerned if they are caused by other known factors.</p>

<p>Possible factors unrelated to the imports could include (this list is not exhaustive):</p>

<ul>
  <li>contraction in demand</li>
  <li>trade-restrictive practices and competition</li>
  <li>developments in technology</li>
  <li>export performance and productivity</li>
  <li>capacity increases</li>
  <li>inefficiency in domestic production</li>
  <li>change in input costs</li>
  <li>increases in energy costs</li>
  <li>ending of subsidies payments</li>
  <li>lack of effective marketing policies</li>
</ul>

<p>Our analysis and final report will include an explanation of the type and extent of injury we have identified. It will also cover the injury and causation analysis we have carried out.</p>

<h4>The economic interest test is met</h4>

<p>Any measure being imposed must be in the economic interest of the UK. We will need to consider the economic significance of affected industries and consumers, the level of injury, the likely impact on affected industries, groups and particular regions, and other factors. This is known as the economic interest test (EIT).</p>

<p>In dumping and subsidy cases, it is presumed that the EIT is met unless we can show that applying a measure is not in the economic interest of the UK. However, in safeguard cases, there is no presumption that the EIT is met. We must therefore actively demonstrate that applying the measure is in the UK’s economic interest.</p>

<h2>Our safeguard investigation process</h2>

<h3>Applying for a safeguard investigation</h3>

<p>UK producers or their representatives can apply to the TRA for a safeguard investigation via our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>. The application should contain sufficient evidence to demonstrate that there have been unforeseen developments leading to increase in imports of goods and that this increase has caused or is causing serious injury to UK producers.</p>

<p>We will assess the application and confirm within 30 days of receipt whether we have decided to initiate a case. To do this, we will check if the application meets the requirements for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standing</li>
  <li>market share</li>
  <li>providing a preliminary adjustment plan</li>
</ul>

<h4>Standing</h4>

<p>Any application must be supported by UK producers whose collective output makes up at least 25 per cent of the total production in the UK of like and directly competitive goods. 
We will also check the application is not opposed by other UK producers of like or directly competitive goods whose collective output is equal to or greater than the percentage that supports the application.</p>

<h4>Market share requirement</h4>

<p>UK producers’ share of the domestic market for these goods needs to be at least 1% to warrant a safeguard investigation. We can set a threshold of higher than 1% if we consider it appropriate. The rationale for applying a higher threshold will be set out in any decision we make to reject an application.</p>

<p>We can also waive the market share requirement and initiate an investigation even where the requirement has not been met. If we do this, we will set out the rationale in our statement of intended final determination.</p>

<h4>Providing a preliminary adjustment plan</h4>

<p>UK producers submitting an application for a safeguard investigation should include a preliminary adjustment plan (although we can waive this requirement). Safeguard measures are designed to provide interim relief to the industry, so it is important for producers to identify how they will adjust to the increased quantities of imports. We ask them to provide an adjustment plan which will explain this. It may include, for instance, details of research and development initiatives or potential innovations which may improve their competitiveness. It could also indicate how the producers intend to introduce efficiencies such as investment in machinery or improving workforce effectiveness.</p>

<h4>Establishing our period of investigation</h4>

<p>For every case we investigate, we will analyse industry data relating to a specific time period before the case initiated. This is our period of investigation (PoI). We will normally look at the most recent five years for which data is available, although this will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, we may need to look at different periods – for example, if domestic production only started in the last year or if the market has changed substantially within the last three years.</p>

<p>If the application meets our requirements, we will initiate a new case and publish a Notice of Initiation.</p>

<h3>How you can participate in an investigation</h3>

<h4>Registering your interest in a case</h4>

<p>If you want to contribute to an investigation, you will need to register your interest on our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>. We will set a registration period which will be specified in our Notice of Initiation. You can register as an interested party or as a contributor. This will mean that you can complete our questionnaire to provide your data to our investigation.</p>

<p>If an interested party or contributor makes themselves known after the end of the registration period, we can decide to include them and issue a questionnaire to them if we consider that their inclusion would not significantly impede the course of the investigation.</p>

<h4>Difference between interested parties and contributors</h4>
<p>An interested party refers to any party directly involved in our investigation.</p>

<p>This may include, amongst others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the government of a relevant foreign country or territory</li>
  <li>an exporter or importer of the goods concerned</li>
  <li>a UK producer of like or directly competitive goods</li>
  <li>a trade or business association representing one or many of these parties</li>
</ul>

<p>A contributor is a person or organisation that is not an interested party but who has contacted us so that they can participate in the investigation, for example by contributing to hearings or submitting supplementary information.</p>

<h4>How we engage with interested parties and contributors to a case</h4>

<p>To help us carry out our investigations, we ask for information from interested parties and contributors. This includes accounting records, company-specific data and pricing practices as well as many other types of information.</p>

<p>To help us gather this information, we will issue questionnaires to registered interested parties and contributors. We will consider all information received from interested parties and contributors, provided that it is objective and can be verified.</p>

<p>Please note that if we have not been made aware of an interested party, for example, by either the party themselves or the applicant UK producer, we cannot issue a questionnaire to them. We must not issue any further questionnaires once our statement of intended final determination has been published.</p>

<p>We may ask for supplementary information throughout the course of the case. Both interested parties and contributors can provide extra information when they feel it is needed.</p>

<h4>When we carry out a limited examination</h4>
<p>If we consider it appropriate, we may seek industry information from smaller numbers of parties on a sample basis only. This is called a limited examination and may apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>categories of goods</li>
  <li>UK producers</li>
  <li>transactions for purchases of like goods or directly competitive goods in the UK</li>
  <li>anything else we consider appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>When we do this, we will only consider late registrations from interested parties. Late contributors cannot be included in any limited examination.</p>

<h4>Making authentication visits</h4>
<p>We can conduct an authentication visit to the premises of producers in the UK to obtain information, verify information supplied to us or to help with our investigation.</p>

<p>After making an authentication visit, we will draft a written report of the visit. The company we visited then has the opportunity to summarise this into a non-confidential authentication report within an agreed timeframe. We will publish this non-confidential report on our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>.</p>

<h3>Conducting hearings</h3>

<p>We may conduct hearings at any time during an investigation, either at the request of an interested party or on our own initiative. When we do so, we will aim to ensure there is enough time in the investigation timeline to allow us to consider any arguments presented.</p>

<h3>Analysing the information we gather</h3>

<p>We will analyse all the evidence we have gathered. We will take into account the information we have received from applicant UK producers, other interested parties, contributors and any other sources from which we have requested information, providing that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it can be verified</li>
  <li>it has been submitted in a way that allows us to use the information without undue difficulty</li>
  <li>it is provided to us in the requested format and within the specified time limits</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not consider oral statements made in the course of a hearing unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the statements are reproduced in writing</li>
  <li>we make the written reproductions available to interested parties and contributors</li>
</ul>

<p>We may disregard confidential information if the party supplying the information has not supplied a non-confidential summary or a statement of reasons unless, using our discretion, we are satisfied that the information is correct.</p>

<p>To support this process, we may use ‘facts available’ to fill in any gaps. This will be done with particular care – and where practicable, we will verify this information from independent sources. Facts available may include information contained in the original application to us for an investigation, from various interested parties or from independent secondary sources such as customs returns and official import statistics.</p>

<h4>Applying the Economic Interest Test</h4>

<p>Any trade remedy measure, including a provisional one, that is imposed must be in the economic interest of the UK. We will consider economic interest during the investigative process alongside other elements of our work. We will only include an EIT assessment if we have confirmed that the imports we are investigating are causing injury to UK industry.</p>

<h4>Closing an investigation</h4>
<p>If we consider it appropriate, we can terminate an investigation at the request of the applicant UK producer(s). We may reject this request and if we do, we will publish a notice which gives our reasons for doing so and we will notify interested parties and contributors. If we accept the request and terminate the investigation, we will publish a notice to this effect and notify interested parties and contributors.</p>

<p>This will explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>why the investigation has been terminated</li>
  <li>a summary of the case to date</li>
  <li>the date from which it has effect</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making our statement of intended final determination</h3>

<p>Before making a final affirmative or negative determination on the case for a new safeguard remedy, we will publish a statement of intended final determination. (This is known as a Statement of Essential Facts in a dumping or subsidy case.)</p>

<p>This statement will describe what our final determination is likely to be. It will also cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a summary of all the facts we have considered during the investigation</li>
  <li>reasons why we have rejected any information provided</li>
  <li>what facts we have drawn on to reach our determination</li>
</ul>

<p>We will communicate with any interested parties who have supplied information that has been used in the investigation to make sure they understand how it was used to help us reach our conclusions.</p>

<p>We will publish the statement on the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a> and will invite interested parties, contributors and anyone else who has supplied information to comment within a stated period. We will consider those comments before making our final determination.</p>

<h3>Making our final determination</h3>

<p>Once we have considered comments on our statement of intended determination, we will make our final determination. This comes in the form of a recommendation to the Secretary of State for International Trade.</p>

<p>There are three types of determination we can make:</p>

<ol>
  <li>final affirmative determination which includes a recommendation for a safeguard measure to be put in place</li>
  <li>final affirmative determination which does not include a recommendation for a safeguard measure. This may be because, for example, we do not think a measure would be in the UK’s economic interest or because the UK producers involved in the case have not provided an adjustment plan and we have not waived the requirement</li>
  <li>final negative determination</li>
</ol>

<p>The Secretary of State will decide whether to accept or reject the recommendation. She will assess whether or not the measure is in the public interest.</p>

<h3>Final affirmative determination with a recommendation for a safeguard measure</h3>

<h4>Criteria</h4>

<p>Goods have been or are being imported into the UK in increased quantities; And the imports have caused or are causing serious injury to UK producers.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Meets EIT and there is an Adjustment plan setting out how UK producers intend to adjust to increased imports is in place.</p>

<h4>Recommendations</h4>

<p>TRA recommends: A definitive safeguard amount; Or a tariff rate quota.</p>

<h3>Final affirmative determination with no recommendation for a safeguard measure</h3>

<h4>Criteria</h4>

<p>Goods have been or are being imported into the UK in increased quantities; And the imports have caused or are causing serious injury to UK producers.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Does not meet EIT; And/or an adjustment plan is not in place setting out how UK producers intend to adjust to increased imports (unless waived).</p>

<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p>TRA does not make a recommendation to apply a safeguard measure.</p>

<h3>Final negative determination</h3>

<h4>Criteria</h4>

<p>Goods have not been or are not being imported into the UK in increased quantities; And/or the imported goods have not caused or are not causing serious injury to UK producers.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h4>Recommendations</h4>

<p>The TRA does not make a recommendation to apply a safeguard measure.</p>

<h2>Applying a safeguard measure</h2>

<p>If we recommend a safeguard measure and the Secretary of State agrees with our recommendation, a measure will then be applied to the goods under investigation.</p>

<h3>How long a safeguard measure may last</h3>

<p>A safeguard measure will only be applied if it is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury to UK producers and to give domestic industry the opportunity to adjust to the surge in imports.</p>

<p>The period when the measure is operational must not exceed four years. However, after an extension review, we can recommend that the measure is extended to a maximum of eight years altogether if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the measure is still needed to remedy or prevent serious injury to the domestic industry</li>
  <li>there is evidence demonstrating that the domestic industry is adjusting</li>
</ul>

<p>Once an imported product has been subject to a safeguard measure, it cannot be immediately subject to another one.</p>

<p>A new safeguard measure cannot be applied until a period of time has elapsed which is at least as long as the period the previous measure covered. For example, if a safeguard measure was in effect for five years, another measure cannot be applied until five years after the previous measure elapsed.</p>

<p>There is also a lower limit to the period of time that must elapse between safeguard remedies – a new remedy cannot be applied until at least two years and one day after the last one expired, regardless of the length of time the previous remedy covered.</p>

<p>If a safeguard measure is in place for more than a year, the measure needs to be progressively liberalised – this means reducing at regular intervals its ability to restrict trade.</p>

<h3>Non-discriminatory application of safeguard measures</h3>

<p>Safeguard measures must be applied on a non-discriminatory basis, also known as the Most-Favoured Nation basis. This means that the safeguard measure is applied to the goods concerned from all countries, subject to limited exceptions.</p>

<h4>Exceptions related to developing countries</h4>

<p>The UK cannot impose a safeguard measure on products originating from a developing country member of the WTO whose imports account for 3% or less of the total imports of those goods into the UK (low volume exporters). This exception applies providing that the collective volume of all the low volume exporters of the goods concerned is no more than 9% of the total imports into the UK.</p>

<p>When we recommend that a safeguard measure is applied, we will publish a list of developing countries which are low volume exporters to clarify which countries will be excluded from the measure.</p>

<h4>Exceptions to non-discriminatory application</h4>

<p>Goods from a particular country or territory should be exempted in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>immediately (the day before) before the UK leaves the European Union (EU), the foreign country or territory from which the goods concerned are imported and the European Union signed a free trade agreement</li>
  <li>the foreign country or territory from which the goods are imported and the UK are party to a free trade agreement</li>
  <li>the free trade agreement between the foreign country or territory from which the goods are imported and the UK contains a provision for exempting goods from safeguard measures</li>
</ul>

<p>They must be exempted from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the scope of a recommendation to apply either a provisional or definitive safeguard remedy</li>
  <li>our assessment on whether the goods concerned have been or are being imported into the UK in increased quantities</li>
  <li>our determination on whether the import of the goods concerned in increased quantities to the UK has caused or is causing serious injury to UK producers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Provisional affirmative determinations and provisional remedies</h3>

<h4>Provisional affirmative determinations</h4>

<p>In a safeguard investigation, a provisional affirmative determination (PAD) is an affirmative determination prior to the final determination based on evidence then before us that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods have been or are being imported into the UK in increased quantities</li>
  <li>the importation of the goods in increased quantities has caused or is causing serious injury to UK producers of those goods</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not make a provisional affirmative determination without making sure that interested parties have been given adequate opportunity to comment through the TRS.</p>

<h4>Provisional Remedies</h4>

<p>When we make a provisional affirmative determination, we may recommend a provisional remedy to the Secretary of State if we are satisfied that the provisional remedy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is necessary to prevent serious injury to UK producers of the goods being caused during the investigation which it would be difficult to repair</li>
  <li>meets the economic interest test.</li>
</ul>

<p>This provisional remedy may take the form of either a provisional safeguarding amount or a provisional tariff rate quota.</p>

<p>To recommend a provisional remedy, we will need evidence that the conditions for applying a provisional affirmative determination and a provisional remedy are met.. The UK industry’s application to us should also contain a statement why a provisional remedy is requested, if this is asked for. We will give interested parties enough time to provide information to us before making a determination to impose a provisional remedy. Any provisional remedy we recommend will not exceed 200 days. We will conduct our investigation into the goods during this time. If at the end of the investigation, we do not establish that increased imports have caused or are causing serious injury, any provisional remedies will be removed and any costs that have been imposed on importers as a result of the measure will be refunded.</p>

<h3>How we calculate a safeguard remedy</h3>

<p>We can calculate a safeguard remedy as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a safeguarding amount, which is an additional amount of import duty on the relevant goods</li>
  <li>a tariff rate quota (TRQ). Goods up to a specified quantity are subject to a lower import duty. Once the quota has been exceeded, a higher import duty will be applied</li>
</ul>

<p>We will only recommend one of the above on any specific goods. If there are multiple types of goods under the same category, we may recommend a different rate of import duty or tariff rate quota for each category. We will do this for all goods being investigated.</p>

<h4>Calculating a safeguarding amount</h4>

<p>In cases where the domestic industry has already suffered injury caused by the import surge, we will set the tariff to eliminate this. In cases where we have established that there is a threat of serious injury, we may base our calculations on the last three representative years and set the tariff rate accordingly. The duty should be set to restore the domestic price level to the average price level of the last three representative years.</p>

<h3>Tariff rate quotas</h3>

<h4>Determining tariff rates   </h4>

<p>A tariff rate quota sets a limit for the amount of goods that can be imported at a certain tariff rate. Goods imported in excess of this quota are subject to a higher tariff. The aim of the tariff rate quota is to provide an equivalent impact on UK prices to a proportional tariff set at the injury margin calculated in the investigation. Where appropriate, we may use econometric modelling to estimate the effect of various quotas and tariff rates on prices.</p>

<p>In cases where injury to domestic industry has not yet occurred, our approach will be to set the tariff rate quota at a level which will prevent future imports which harm the industry. This aims to keep the imports at a ‘normal’ level, which might be no lower than the average of the last three representative years.</p>

<p>We will reduce the amount of import duty which can be applied to the goods subject to the quota over the period of the measure. This can be done through increases in the amount of the quota, decreases in the rates of import duty or both. This is known as liberalisation.</p>

<h4>Allocating quota shares </h4>

<p>We will consult with the Secretary of State before making any recommendation on allocating quotas.</p>

<h2>Reviewing safeguard measures</h2>

<p>Safeguard measures are subject to a number of different types of review while they are in operation.</p>

<h4>Extension reviews</h4>

<p>An extension review is designed to establish whether or not a safeguard should be extended. It can be requested by or on behalf of the UK producers or the TRA can self-initiate.</p>

<p>The application must not be made more than 12 months before the safeguard measure is due to expire and must be made through our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>.</p>

<p>When we carry out an extension review, we will consider a number of questions, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is it likely that the import of the goods concerned in increased quantities will recur?</li>
  <li>has the serious injury been removed or reduced, in part or wholly due to the existing measure?</li>
  <li>if the measure is not extended, how likely is it that serious injury will recur?</li>
  <li>what adjustments have the UK producers made?</li>
</ul>

<p>The possible outcomes of an extension review are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the measure expires on the date given in the original public notice</li>
  <li>we recommend extending the measure in order to continue preventing or removing serious injury and to help UK producers adjust. We can only recommend an extension if we consider it meets the economic interest test</li>
  <li>we recommend extending the measure and also changing its form or varying the pace of liberalisation</li>
</ul>

<p>If we reject an application for an extension, we will notify the applicant.</p>

<h4>Mid-term review</h4>

<p>If a safeguard measure is put in place for longer than three years, we will carry out a mid-term review no later than half way through this period. The purpose of the review is to check that it is still necessary to have the measure in place. Our review must also consider whether an alternative measure (a safeguard amount or a tariff rate quota) would be a better way to remove or prevent serious injury or to help affected UK producers adjust.</p>

<p>When we carry out a mid-term review, we will consider a number of questions, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the circumstances under which the original remedy was applied significantly changed?</li>
  <li>if the remedy was revoked, how likely is it that serious injury to domestic industry will recur?</li>
  <li>has the serious injury been removed or reduced, in part or wholly due to the existing safeguard remedy?</li>
  <li>is the pace of liberalisation of the remedy appropriate? (We will look at the UK producers’ adjustment plans in order to help answer this question)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three possible outcomes of a mid-term review:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the remedy is maintained unchanged</li>
  <li>the remedy is changed in its level, form or pace of liberalisation</li>
  <li>the remedy is revoked</li>
</ol>

<h4>Discontinuation review</h4>

<p>A discontinuation review considers whether it is still appropriate to maintain a safeguard remedy . We can self-initiate a discontinuation review where we have sufficient information that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there has been a lasting change in circumstances since the safeguard remedy was imposed</li>
</ul>

<p>And</p>

<ul>
  <li>the UK producers are not suffering or will not suffer serious injury</li>
</ul>

<p>When we initiate a review, we will publish a notice of initiation  and notify the Secretary of State and interested parties.</p>

<p>When we carry out a discontinuation review, we will consider a number of questions, including but not limited to the following:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>has there been a lasting change of circumstances since the remedy was imposed?</li>
  <li>are UK producers suffering or may they suffer serious injury?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two possible outcomes of a discontinuation review: </p>

<ol>
  <li>The measure is maintained.</li>
  <li>The measure is revoked.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tariff rate quota review</h4>
<p>A tariff rate quota review considers whether a TRQ should be varied and is carried out if we have sufficient information that there has been a change in circumstances since the TRQ was applied.</p>

<p>A review can only take place after six months has passed since one of the following has been concluded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a safeguard investigation</li>
  <li>mid-term review</li>
  <li>extension review</li>
  <li>transition review</li>
</ul>

<p>We may initiate a TRQ review following an application from or made on behalf of an interested party, or on our own initiative.</p>

<p>In carrying out the review, we will not make any assessments about increased quantities of imports, or about injury or causation. Nor will weconsider what would be an adequate amount to prevent serious injury due to any increase in imports of the goods.</p>

<p>When we carry out a tariff rate quota review, we will consider a number of questions, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has there been any change in circumstances since the TRQ was imposed? To establish this, we may look at a range of indicators:</p>
  </li>
  <li>has the tariff rate quota, or any part of it, been exhausted?</li>
  <li>have there been any changes in demand for the relevant goods?</li>
  <li>what has been the effect of an anti-dumping amount or countervailing amount being applied to the relevant goods or like goods and directly competitive goods in the UK?</li>
  <li>has there been any trade diversion following the imposition of anti-dumping, countervailing, safeguard or other trade measures by a foreign country or territory?</li>
  <li>what has been the impact of the tariff rate quota on traditional trade flows?</li>
  <li>should imports from a developing country member of the WTO which had been excluded from the safeguard remedy now be included?</li>
  <li>should imports from a developing country member of the WTO which had not been excluded from the safeguard remedy now be excluded?</li>
  <li>the amount and allocation of the tariff rate quota appropriate for the UK’s domestic market conditions?</li>
  <li>how does the tariff rate quota align with maintaining traditional trade flows?</li>
</ul>

<p>The possible outcomes of a tariff rate quota review are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The tariff rate quota is maintained.</li>
  <li>The amount or allocation of the tariff rate quota in relation to some or all goods subject to review may be varied. Variation may also include varying the pace of liberalisation. 
Any variation will not reduce the rate of import duty or vary the period for which the goods are subject to the measure.</li>
  <li>The tariff rate quota is revoked for all or some of the goods subject to review. For this to happen, there will need to be sufficient evidence that UK producers have stopped producing these goods.</li>
</ol>

<p>*interested party can make a request</p>

<h2>Suspending a safeguard measure</h2>

<p>Interested parties can apply for a safeguard measure to be suspended. They must apply through our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>. The application must demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a change in market conditions</li>
  <li>the temporary nature of that change</li>
  <li>the effect of the change on the UK producers involved in the case</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to suspend a safeguard remedy is taken by the Secretary of State for International Trade, based on our recommendation and after considering whether it is in the public interest. If the Secretary of State accepts the recommendation that the safeguard remedy should be suspended, they must publish a notice of the recommendation with their acceptance. The Secretary of State must also notify interested parties and issue a taxation notice to give effect to the recommendation.</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State rejects the recommendation, they will publish a notice which includes prescribed information from the Regulations. They must also notify interested parties and provide a statement to the House of Commons setting out their reasons for rejecting the recommendation. The only reason the Secretary of State can reject a recommendation is if they consider he recommendation not to be in the public interest.</p>

<h4>How long suspension of a safeguard remedy can last</h4>

<p>The initial suspension period cannot last longer than nine months from the date of the publication of the notice to suspend. However, it can be increased following an application by an interested party, if we consider it appropriate. It can be extended to a maximum of 21 months from the date of publication of the original notice to suspend.</p>

<h4>Reinstating a safeguard remedy</h4>

<p>We can make a recommendation to reinstate a suspended safeguard remedy to the Secretary of State, who will decide whether to accept or reject that recommendation. The decision will be published in a notice under Section 13 of the Taxation Act and interested parties will be notified.</p>
