<h4>Legislation in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (the Taxation Act)</h4>
<p>The parameters of the Economic Interest Test are outlined in the Taxation Act. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/22/schedule/4/paragraph/25/enacted" rel="external">Paragraph 25 of Schedule 4</a>  and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/22/schedule/5/paragraph/23/enacted" rel="external">Paragraph 23 of Schedule 5</a> of the Act identify the economic factors we must consider, where they are relevant.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/trade-remedies-investigations-directorate-trid-dumping-and-subsidisation-investigations-guidance">Guidance</a> published by the Department for International Trade on also provides detail on how the Economic Interest Test should be conducted.</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Economic Interest Test</h3>

<p>The Economic Interest Test (EIT) is a requirement of the UK’s process for investigating trade practices which may be causing injury to UK industry. It is a requirement in almost all investigations and reviews with limited exceptions.</p>

<p>The EIT considers the expected impact on the UK of imposing a trade measure, compared to the impact of taking no action or introducing a different measure. The aim of the process is to determine whether the implementation of a proposed trade remedies measure is in the wider economic interest of the UK.</p>

<p>The test looks at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>injury caused to UK industry by the imports we are investigating and the benefits to that industry of removing the injury</li>
  <li>economic significance of affected UK industries and consumers</li>
  <li>likely impact on wider UK industries and on consumers</li>
  <li>likely impact on particular geographic areas or groups within the UK</li>
  <li>likely consequences for the competitive environment and the structure of UK markets for these goods</li>
  <li>other matters that we consider relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>In anti-dumping and countervailing investigations where the presence of dumped/subsidised imports which are causing injury has been established, the economic interest test is presumed to be met unless the TRA is satisfied that the application of the measures is not in the economic interest of the UK. In safeguard investigations there is no such presumption.</p>

<h4>Applying the EIT to reviews into existing measures</h4>

<p>We also apply the EIT when we are carrying out transition reviews, expiry reviews and interim reviews of current measures. We will not conduct an EIT in circumvention, absorption, scope or new exporter reviews.  When we apply the EIT to a review, we will look at the expected impact on the UK of maintaining, changing or removing the measure compared to the impact of taking no action.</p>

<p>The process we follow is largely the same as with a new investigation. However, in reviews where we conduct the EIT, we can also consider data and evidence that shows the actual impact the measure has had.</p>

<h2>Our test process</h2>

<p>When we begin an investigation or review, we will need to gather a wide range of information. We will look at economic interest alongside other elements of the investigation, depending on what data and evidence is available at different stages of the process. However, we won’t include an EIT assessment in our final determination unless we have confirmed that the dumped and/or subsidised imports we are investigating are causing injury to UK industry. In a safeguards case, we won’t include an EIT assessment unless we have confirmed that the surge of imports we are investigating is causing serious injury to UK industry.</p>

<p>The main stages of our EIT process are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying the affected industries and consumers</li>
  <li>gathering evidence from relevant groups such as upstream and downstream producers and exporters, as appropriate</li>
  <li>assessing the evidence for each of the factors we need to consider under the EIT and drawing conclusions</li>
  <li>publishing our initial EIT assessment as part of the provisional findings of the investigation alongside the statement of essential facts</li>
  <li>sending our final determination on the investigation to the Secretary of State following the conclusion of the investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>If we have found that there are dumped/ subsidised/ a surge of imports causing injury to UK industry, we will include a definitive assessment of the EIT, accounting for all the data and evidence presented to us. We do this regardless of whether the test is met or not. If we have not found that dumped/ subsidised/ a surge of imports are causing injury to UK industry, the EIT will not be included in our final determination.</p>

<h3>Data sources we may use</h3>

<p>In our investigation, we can make use of any data and evidence we consider relevant provided that we assess it critically and verify it using independent sources where practical. Our primary sources will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>responses to the questionnaires we send to relevant groups such as domestic producers of the like goods</li>
  <li>written submissions from affected groups or businesses</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of information and facts available is discussed in more detail in the investigation process guidance.</p>

<h4>Questionnaires</h4>

<p>To help us carry out our investigation, we will issue questionnaires to domestic producers, importers, foreign exporters and (for subsidy and some dumping investigations) foreign governments.</p>

<p>Within these questionnaires, we will ask respondents to identify possible UK-based upstream and downstream contributors such as suppliers, distributors and end users of the relevant goods.</p>

<p>We will then issue additional questionnaires to these parties to help us build a more detailed understanding of the supply chain for like goods produced in the UK. For example, we may want to determine to what extent suppliers rely on demand from the industry that has asked us to investigate the imports, or we may look at downstream industries and ask how practical it would be for them to substitute domestically produced goods for the imported goods.</p>

<h4>Submissions from interested parties and contributors</h4>

<p>When we initiate an investigation, we will set a period for interested parties and contributors to contact us to register their interest. Parties will be able to register through our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>. Interested parties are those who are directly involved in our investigation, such as exporters or importers of the goods concerned in the investigation or trade associations representing UK producers. Contributors are those other than interested parties who have contacted us in order to participate in the investigation or review.</p>

<p>Interested parties and contributors may provide additional submissions which are relevant to the EIT, up to the point at which we publish our Statement of Essential Facts. They can also present evidence at oral hearings, which we may organise on request from interested parties. If necessary, we may also hold bilateral meetings with interested parties during the investigation process, to clarify details of their submissions.</p>

<p>In investigations where a particular geographical area is likely to be affected by the measure due to the location of an industry or related industries, we may contact relevant local authorities and, where appropriate, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those contacted will be asked to register as an interested party, or contributor. All information collected will be placed on the public file and made available to interested parties and contributors unless they request it be treated as confidential and demonstrate why it should be treated in this way.</p>

<p>We will assess the quality and relevance of any evidence provided to us on an individual basis. Evidence provided should be supported by independent sources where possible and provided in sufficient time to be considered. We cannot accept oral statements unless they are also reproduced in writing and put on the public file to allow interested parties and contributors to view them. Our reasons for either incorporating or dismissing information as a part of the EIT will be explained in our Statement of Essential Facts, which we publish once we have completed our analysis.</p>

<h4>Other available sources</h4>

<p>We will also consider data and evidence from other publicly available sources, both UK-based and international. We will critically assess and verify this where necessary. For more information on the use of information, please refer to the investigation process guidance. These may include trade databases such as HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the United Nations’ Comtrade, industry publications and employment and industrial data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>

<h2>How we apply the EIT when we are investigating the case for a trade remedy measure</h2>

<p>This section explains how we assess the factors which we must consider in an EIT, in line with legislation.</p>

<h4>Injury to UK industry caused by the dumped, subsidised or surge of imports under investigation</h4>

<p>At an early stage of the investigation, we need to determine if there is injury to domestic industry and if it is caused by the imports of dumped or subsidised goods, or if there is serious injury from a surge in imports. (For further information about how we do this, see our guidance on dumping and subsidy investigations and on identifying injury and causation.) When we are carrying out reviews, we need to establish whether injury is likely to occur if the measure is varied or removed.</p>

<p>When we are looking at the EIT, we will ask an additional question – how a future trade remedy measure might affect the injury being caused to domestic industry?</p>

<p>To do this, we will compare potential injury to domestic industry in scenarios where a measure has or has not been imposed.</p>

<p>For example, we would look at the likely impact on common injury indicators for UK producers (such as market shares and profit margins) if a measure were or were not in place.</p>

<h4>Economic significance of affected UK industries and consumers</h4>

<p>We identify the domestic industries producing like goods to the goods we are investigating (or directly competitive goods in safeguard investigations) and the domestic consumers who would be affected by a measure. We will aim to establish the economic significance to the UK of each of them. When we are looking at consumers, we will consider the entire UK market for this type of goods, including both those produced domestically and imported goods.</p>

<p>Some of the factors we may look at include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Value added – what do UK industries contribute to the value of the UK produced goods at different stage of the supply chain?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employment – how many people are employed within the industry on work that is directly related to the product in question at each UK location?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Market share – what is the market share of UK producers, as a proportion of total sales of this type of goods in the UK?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Market structure – what is the size distribution of UK producers and what proportion of the market is accounted for by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? What are the upstream and downstream industries within the UK and how are they related to the industry that applied to us to investigate the case for a new measure?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consumers – how is the final product used and by whom?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Potential effect of a new trade remedy on industries and consumers</h4>

<p>For this factor, we will assess the likely impact on the UK industry of imposing or not imposing a measure. We will also assess the impact that a measure may have on downstream industries, consumers and other affected groups such as upstream suppliers, distributors and importers based within the UK.</p>

<p>When we do this, we will compare scenarios in which a measure is and is not applied, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative evidence. This assessment will be completed in two stages: We will estimate the likely effects on prices and quantities of goods throughout the supply chain. For example, how might the price of or demand for the downstream product change as a result of the measure? We will assess the possible impacts of these changes in price and demand on the relevant UK industries and consumers. For example, how might a change in the price of an input product affect a downstream industry?</p>

<h4>Effect on particular geographic areas and groups</h4>

<p>Within our EIT assessment, we will assess if a measure will disproportionately affect particular geographic areas or groups. The evidence we draw on will typically include a combination of information from questionnaires and publicly available information on socio-economic factors.</p>

<p>To help us understand if an industry is particularly significant to a geographic area and the potential implications of jobs being lost or gained, we will consider a variety of factors. These may include the proportion of jobs in the area that are accounted for by the industry in question, what alternative employment opportunities there are and data on regional socio-economic welfare, such as deprivation indices.</p>

<p>We may also assess these factors in relation to upstream, downstream or related industries, if we consider a trade remedy measure is likely to have a significant impact.</p>

<p>We will evaluate whether particular demographic groups are disproportionally affected, particularly groups with protected characteristics as outlined in the Equality Act 2010. This may cover both consumer and employee groups. Where appropriate, we may seek information from other government departments, local authorities and the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to add to our understanding.</p>

<h4>Effect on the competitive environment and market structure</h4>

<p>We will assess the effect of a potential measure on the competitive environment within a market. Our assessment will be mainly qualitative and will look at both the existing market structure and the state of competition within the market. It will explore both short-term and long-term possible effects of imposing a measure.</p>

<p>We will draw on questionnaire responses for our analysis, including topics such as market share and the number of suppliers within the market for the product in question. We will also consider additional contextual factors such as whether there are barriers to entry for new producers and how easy it is for consumers to switch suppliers.</p>

<p>We will consider the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>will the measure directly or indirectly limit the number or range of suppliers on the market?</li>
  <li>will the measure limit the ability of suppliers to compete?</li>
  <li>will the measure limit suppliers’ incentive to compete vigorously?</li>
  <li>will the measure limit the choices and information available to consumers?</li>
</ul>

<p>We may consider other questions where relevant to the investigation.</p>

<h4>Other factors which we consider relevant</h4>

<p>On a case-by-case basis, we will also assess other economic issues which may be relevant to our investigation. These may be highlighted through engagement with interested parties and contributors and we will assess their relevance based on the likely implications on the UK’s economic interests. If we decide a factor is relevant to our investigation, we will assess it alongside other components of the test.</p>

<h2>How we reach a conclusion on the EIT</h2>

<p>Once we have completed our analysis, we will determine whether a trade remedy measure would be in the economic interest of the UK.</p>

<p>If we decide that the negative impacts to the UK of imposing the measure would be greater than the benefits of addressing the injury to UK industry, this means that the test is not met.</p>

<p>In dumping or subsidy investigations, the default presumption is that the EIT is met, so we only consider the test not to be met if the negative impacts of a recommendation on the UK economy are disproportionate to the need to remove the injury caused to UK industry. This presumption does not apply to safeguard investigations, where we must demonstrate that applying the measure is in the economic interest of the UK.</p>

<p>When we report the outcome of the EIT, we must do more than simply state that the costs of a measure outweigh the benefits. We will provide a reasonable explanation to demonstrate that this is the case. If we conclude that the test is not met, we will explain why we have reached this conclusion.</p>

<p>As well as assessing whether the measure is in the economic interest of the UK, we will also consider which form of measure would best minimise the negative impacts of the measure on some parties while retaining the overall benefits. There are three elements of the measure that we can vary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the duration– this can be up to five years</li>
  <li>the type of duty– for instance, we could recommend an ad valorem measure</li>
  <li>the goods for which the measure is imposed– for instance, we may not recommend the measure for all the goods concerned if we determine that the test has only been met for some of the goods</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we share our findings</h3>

<p>The provisional and final determinations will both include our assessment of the Economic Interest Test. Within these, we will present the evidence we have considered for each component of the EIT and provide the reasoning for our final conclusion and recommendation.</p>

<p>If the EIT has not been met at the final determination stage, we will recommend to the Secretary of State that the measure is not imposed.</p>
