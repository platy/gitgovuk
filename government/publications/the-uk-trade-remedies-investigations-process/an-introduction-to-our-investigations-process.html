<h2>Types of investigation</h2>

<p>There are three trade policy tools to counter imports which are causing or threatening injury to domestic industry. These three tools are covered within UK legislation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>anti-dumping remedies</li>
  <li>countervailing remedies</li>
  <li>safeguard remedies</li>
</ol>

<p>Anti-dumping remedies address imported goods being sold within the UK at prices which are below the normal value in the country they are being exported from.</p>

<p>Countervailing remedies address imported goods which are being subsidised by foreign governments.</p>

<p>Safeguard remedies protect domestic industries against an unforeseen surge of imports.</p>

<h3>Dumping investigations</h3>

<p>Dumping occurs when goods are imported into a country and sold at a price that is below their normal value in their country of export. Dumping investigations assess whether dumping is causing material injury to a domestic industry.</p>

<p>Investigations may normally run 11-13 months, depending on the investigation.</p>

<h3>Subsidy investigations</h3>

<p>Subsidy investigations assess whether subsidised imports are causing material injury to a domestic industry.</p>

<p>Investigations may normally run 11-13 months, depending on the investigation.</p>

<h3>Safeguard investigations</h3>

<p>Safeguard investigations assess whether an unforeseen surge of imports is causing or threatening serious injury to UK producers.</p>

<p>Safeguard investigations may normally run 8-10 months, depending on the investigation.</p>

<h2>Initiating an investigation</h2>

<p>We may initiate an investigation when a UK industry applies to us to do so, or in exceptional circumstances, by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>More guidance on how we assess applications from UK industry can be found in our Application Assessment guidance.</p>

<p>The requirements for initiating an investigation are laid out in UK legislation. These include who to notify and when and what information our initiation notices should include.</p>

<p>We will publish notices of initiation online through the Trade Remedies Service. This will serve as a public file.</p>

<h3>Dumping investigations</h3>

<p>When we initiate a dumping investigation, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify the foreign government(s) involved</li>
  <li>publish the notice of initiation</li>
  <li>notify the Secretary of State and interested parties</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subsidy investigations</h3>

<p>When we initiate a subsidy investigation, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before initiation, invite the foreign government(s) to participate in consultations</li>
  <li>publish the notice of initiation</li>
  <li>notify the Secretary of State and interested parties, including the relevant foreign government concerned</li>
</ul>

<h3>Safeguard investigations</h3>

<p>When we initiate a safeguard investigation, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish the notice of initiation</li>
  <li>notify the Secretary of State and interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, safeguard investigations are not normally initiated in exactly the same way as other investigations. This is because a preliminary duty or tariff rate quota can be introduced soon after initiation to offset the surge of imports.</p>

<p>*Measures will affect all countries except for those specifically exempted</p>

<h3>The scope of the investigation</h3>

<p>The scope of an investigation is limited to a specific goods description and we will set this out in our notice of initiation.</p>

<h3>Amending the scope</h3>

<p>In some cases, we may amend the scope of the investigation following the notice of initiation. This may result in changes to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the description of the goods concerned</li>
  <li>the period of investigation</li>
  <li>the alleged subsidies (only for subsidy investigations)</li>
</ul>

<p>To determine if we need to revise the scope, we will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether we would have initiated an investigation if we had been considering the alternative scope</li>
  <li>whether the proposed revision may prejudice the interests of any interested party or contributor</li>
  <li>whether the proposed revision would seriously delay and prevent us from proceeding with the investigation in a timely manner</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do revise the scope, we will give all interested parties and contributors our reasons for the proposed revision and an opportunity to comment. We will then publish an amended notice of initiation.</p>

<h2>Interested parties and contributors</h2>

<h3>Registering interested parties and contributors</h3>

<p>Once we initiate an investigation, we will set a period for interested parties and contributors to contact us. This is known as a registration period. Parties should register online through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>.</p>

<p>It is very important that parties register with us during this period to make sure they have the opportunity to be involved in the investigation. We will consider requests made after the registration period on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Differences between interested parties and contributors</h3>

<p>An interested party refers to any party directly involved in our investigation. This may include, amongst others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a foreign government</li>
  <li>an exporter or importer of the goods concerned</li>
  <li>a UK producer of the like goods</li>
  <li>a trade or business association representing one or many of these parties</li>
</ul>

<p>Interested parties can request hearings or interim, absorption, circumvention or scope reviews. They can also apply for a safeguard to be suspended. When we are making a Statement of Essential Facts or Statement of Intended Final Determination, we will tell interested parties who have given us information how we have used their information and describe our assessment. Contributors will be able to see and respond to a non-confidential version of this.</p>

<p>A contributor is a person or organisation who is not an interested party but who has contacted us so that they can participate in an investigation or a review, e.g. by contributing to hearings or submitting supplementary information. Contributors cannot request hearings or reviews or ask for safeguards to be suspended and we donât inform them of the details of our assessment.</p>

<p>The roles of interested parties and contributors do overlap in some ways. For instance, we will ask for similar information from both groups and we will verify information from them in the same way.</p>

<h2>Period of investigation</h2>

<p>For every case we investigate, we will analyse industry data relating to a specific time period before the case initiated â this is the period of investigation.</p>

<h3>Dumping and subsidy investigations</h3>

<p>When we are investigating dumping and subsidy cases, we will use a period of investigation of around a year. We will aim for the end point to be as close as possible to the date of initiation. In general, periods of investigation will finish at the end of a calendar month. Where the UK industry uses similar financial years, the period of investigation will generally end on the final day of a financial quarter. However, we will decide this on a case-by-case basis. We may also follow a different practice necessary to align with other elements of the investigation.</p>

<h3>Difference between period of investigation and injury period</h3>

<p>The period of investigation will normally be the 12-month period before the date of initiation, while the injury period will be the period of investigation and normally include the 36 months immediately before this (i.e. 48 months in total).</p>

<h3>Period of investigation for safeguard investigations</h3>

<p>There is no set length for a period of investigation for a safeguard investigation. We will use an appropriate period of time that provides sufficient data to assess whether a surge of imports has occurred. We will consider the import trends during the entire period of investigation, especially the recent past.</p>

<p>We may use a period of investigation of three to five years prior to the initiation of the safeguard investigation. Our practice on this is further outlined in our safeguard guidance.</p>

<h2>About our questionnaires</h2>

<h3>Purpose and content of questionnaires</h3>

<p>To carry out our investigations, we ask for information from interested parties and contributors. This includes accounting records, company-specific data and pricing practices, and indicators of the economic performance of the UK industry. We may obtain this information through questionnaires issued to interested parties, contributors and any other group that we think is relevant.</p>

<p>We will send a questionnaire to each type of interested party or contributor (e.g. domestic producer, importer, exporter). This is because various elements of our investigation require different information from each group.</p>

<p>For dumping and subsidy investigations, we will seek to issue questionnaires to all interested parties and contributors who have registered their interest with us and all parties identified in the application. Please note that we will not typically send questionnaires to foreign governments in dumping cases. Sampling may be used in certain circumstances. More information on this can be found in our sampling guidance.</p>

<p>In safeguard investigations, we may send questionnaires to any of these parties.</p>

<h3>Time limits for responding to questionnaires</h3>

<p>We will set a time limit for interested parties to respond to questionnaires and return the completed version to us. We may grant extensions to deadlines on a case-by-case basis with a commitment to ensuring fairness to all parties.</p>

<h3>Deficiency notices</h3>

<p>If we find that the information supplied in a returned questionnaire is inadequate, we may issue a notice to the relevant interested party or contributor to request further information. This is known as a deficiency notice.</p>

<p>The most common reasons for a deficiency notice being issued are that information is omitted, is in the incorrect format, or not to the required standard.  We will send deficiency notices online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>. These will include a time limit for the information requested to be supplied.</p>

<h2>Sampling</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Where a case involves a large number of either products or individual parties, we may verify and review a smaller data set to permit the investigation to proceed. We will do this by sending pre-sampling questionnaires to all the groups involved. Based on the responses, we may select a sample of exporters, producers, importers or products to consider.</p>

<p>We may use sampling in all types of investigation and relevant reviews, including transition reviews.</p>

<p>We may use sampling to determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>export price or normal value of goods</li>
  <li>subsidy amount</li>
  <li>material or serious injury</li>
</ul>

<p>Where appropriate, we may use sampling for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overseas exporters</li>
  <li>importers</li>
  <li>categories of goods</li>
  <li>UK producers</li>
  <li>UK transactions involving purchases of the like goods</li>
  <li>anything else we think appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methodology for selecting a sample</h3>

<p>We will decide which parties to sample by using data from the pre-sampling questionnaires. For calculating dumping margins, we may sample based on either of the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the largest volume of exports we can reasonably investigate</li>
  <li>another statistically valid method</li>
</ul>

<p>For all other elements of our investigations, we can use any reasonable method to select a sample. We will determine the most appropriate approach to use on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>In dumping cases, we will publish lists of proposed samples of overseas exporters and UK importers on the Trade Remedies Service and invite responses. We will then finalise the sample and send questionnaires to the parties sampled.</p>

<h3>Parties not sampled</h3>

<p>Overseas exporters who are sampled and who cooperate with our investigation will have an individual duty rate calculated for them. Exporters who are not sampled may also ask us to calculate an individual margin for them. We will accept this request and calculate an individual duty rate for them unless this would be unduly burdensome and prevent the timely completion of the investigation.</p>

<h3>Differentiated duty rates where sampling is used</h3>

<p>When we sample exporters in dumping and subsidy investigations, we will set different duty rates for cooperating sampled and non-sampled parties.</p>

<p>First, we will set an individual duty rate for each cooperating exporter that we include in our sample. We will then set a single duty rate for all non-sampled, cooperating exporters. This will be the weighted average of the rates for the sampled cooperating exporters.</p>

<p>Finally, we will set a single duty rate for all other exporters, including non-cooperating exporters and new exporters. This is known as the residual rate. We will set this rate on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>Definition of UK industry</h3>

<p>In dumping and subsidy investigations, UK industry is defined as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the producers in the UK of like goods</li>
  <li>a group of those producers whose collective output of like goods constitutes a major proportion of the total production of those goods in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>In each investigation we carry out, we will determine which definition to use and therefore which UK producers constitute the âUK industryâ in the particular goods based on what is most appropriate for that investigation. We will use this as the basis for relevant calculations, such as determining whether UK industry has suffered/is suffering injury and determining an injury margin.</p>

<p>In safeguard cases, we will take a similar approach, although the processes for a safeguard case mean we use the definition âUK producersâ rather than âUK industryâ.</p>

<p>When we sample UK producers, we will select our sample from the UK producers we have defined as constituting UK industry.</p>

<h3>Disregarding UK producers</h3>

<p>In dumping and subsidy cases only, we may also disregard any UK producers that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>import the goods concerned</li>
  <li>are related to an importer/overseas exporter of the goods concerned
if we consider that the relationship causes the producer to behave differently to other, unrelated producers of like goods in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If we disregard individual UK producers in our investigation, they will be excluded from the definition of UK industry/producers and any relevant assessments, such as the injury assessment.</p>

<p>We will determine the effect of the relationship on the producer based on the circumstances of the case and the information available to us at the time. In this context, âbehave differentlyâ generally refers to suffering injury differently and/or interacting with the investigation differently compared to other, unrelated producers. In general, we will disregard a UK producer where the grounds for disregarding them on the basis of relationship to an importer/overseas exporter are met.</p>

<h2>Our verification process</h2>

<p>Verification helps us to establish an accurate and reasonable dataset for our investigation.</p>

<p>Our initial desk analysis seeks to establish complete and reliable data for calculating trade remedy measures. We use this analysis to determine specific questions and areas to consider in further verification.</p>

<p>During desk analysis, we may find submitted data is incomplete. In these cases, we may send a deficiency notice. For more information on this process, please see our questionnaires guidance.</p>

<p>We may also carry out verification which assess the origin and validity of the data submitted. At our discretion we will visit companies to assess the completeness, relevance and accuracy of their data. Visits will generally take place on the premises of the interested party. They normally take several days for UK producers or overseas exporters, or a day for importers.</p>

<h2>Use of information and facts available</h2>

<p>In our investigations, we will consider information provided to us by any interested party, contributor or other person we have requested information from, provided that the information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is verifiable</li>
  <li>has been appropriately submitted (in such a way that we can use the information without undue difficulty)</li>
  <li>has been supplied to us within any applicable time limit</li>
  <li>where relevant, has been supplied to us in the form we requested</li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide our reasons if we disregard information from an interested party. We will include these in the Statement of Essential Facts or Final Determination.</p>

<p>Where submissions are only partially complete, we will use âfacts availableâ to fill in any gaps. We will not disregard all the data just because some parts are not as complete as desired. We will examine this on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>âFacts availableâ may include information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contained in the application</li>
  <li>from other interested parties in the investigation</li>
  <li>from other secondary sources</li>
</ul>

<p>When we use âfacts availableâ, we will do so with special circumspection and, where practical, verify information from secondary sources. This includes information in the application.</p>

<p>We will explain how we came to any decisions based on âfacts availableâ and detail any supporting information we used. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>published price lists</li>
  <li>official import statistics</li>
  <li>customs return</li>
  <li>information from other interested parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-cooperation</h2>

<p>We may consider an interested party to be non-cooperating if they fail to cooperate with an investigation or significantly impede its progress. If we believe parties are not cooperating with us, we may disregard any information they supplied. If an interested party does not cooperate and we believe relevant information is being withheld from us, this could lead to a result which is less favourable to the party in question â for instance, it may affect the duty rate that applies to them.</p>

<p>We will not find a party to be non-cooperative if they have acted to the best of their ability to cooperate with us.</p>

<h2>Confidential information and non-confidential summaries</h2>

<p>When carrying out trade remedies investigations, we gather a range of information from interested parties and contributors. We need to handle this evidence in a way which respects the confidentiality of this information and is also fair and transparent.</p>

<h3>Why we ask for non-confidential versions of information submitted to us</h3>

<p>Itâs important that parties involved in a case have the opportunity to understand the evidence provided by other interested parties and contributors and defend their own interests by submitting responses to such information if necessary. However, we understand that some of the information parties provide to us may be confidential to them. Therefore, we ask parties to provide non-confidential versions of their evidence as well, so that we can make this available to other parties.</p>

<p>The non-confidential versions must be sufficiently detailed for other parties to have a reasonable understanding of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the substance of the information to which it relates</li>
  <li>its potential relevance to the investigation or review</li>
</ul>

<p>So if youâre submitting confidential documents to us, you must accompany them with non-confidential versions which donât include your commercially sensitive data or other confidential information.  If you donât provide a non-confidential version, we may not be able to use the information that you have provided.</p>

<p>The non-confidential version of a file must be identical to the confidential version, except for the information which is considered confidential. We usually canât accept responses such as âN/Aâ, âConfidentialâ, or simply leaving the answer blank. Further guidance on how to prepare the non-confidential version is given below. By providing non-confidential versions which meet these guidelines, you will help us process the information you give us more efficiently and reduce the likelihood that we will need to contact you to update and amend the documents.</p>

<p>If, in exceptional circumstances, youâre unable to supply a non-confidential version of the required information, you will need to explain why it was not possible to do so. Further guidance on when exceptional circumstances may apply is given below.</p>

<h3>What is confidential information?</h3>

<p>We may treat data from a party as confidential where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they supply it on a confidential basis</li>
  <li>the information is, by its nature, confidential</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, you will need to give the reasons why you feel the information should be treated as confidential.</p>

<p>Confidential information can include anything which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>would give a significant advantage to a competitor (for example, details about a production process, price levels and policies, cost of production, and customer lists)</li>
  <li>would have a significant adverse effect on the person supplying the information (or their source), including information obtained from another individual who does not want their identity to become public
a third party has labelled confidential</li>
  <li>is covered by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">data protection rules</a>
</li>
  <li>is personal information which identifies individuals, including names of individuals within the company, contact details and signatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we think you have incorrectly identified something as confidential, we will contact you to discuss this.</p>

<h3>How to provide confidential information in a non-confidential format</h3>

<p>You must submit the non-confidential version of a file at the same time â and to the same deadline â as you provide the confidential version. Youâll need to submit all your documents and their non-confidential versions online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>.</p>

<p>The non-confidential version of a file must be identical to the confidential version, except for the information which is considered confidential.</p>

<h3>How to create non-confidential versions of your documents</h3>

<p>Any non-confidential summary should contain enough detail to give a reasonable understanding of the confidential information.</p>

<p>To create a non-confidential version of a document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the sections that contain information you think is confidential; 
provide reasons why you believe the information should be considered confidential</li>
  <li>delete or redact those sections by providing a non-confidential summary of the information which has been removed (this must contain enough detail to give a reasonable understanding of the confidential information)</li>
  <li>ensure that all personal information which identifies individuals, including names of individuals within the company, contact details and signatures has been removed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Examples of redacting confidential text</h4>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<h4>Confidential Version</h4>

<p>We use SAP accounting systems for our financial accounting, sales and production. 
Company expenditure is allocated as follows: 45% to region A; 30% to region B; 25% to region C.</p>

<h4>Non-Confidential Version</h4>

<p>We use [redacted â commercially sensitive information] accounting systems for our financial accounting, sales and production.</p>

<p>Company expenditure is allocated across three regions [the exact split of the allocation has been deleted for reasons of commercial sensitivity].</p>

<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<h4>Confidential Version</h4>

<p>The main inputs for our production process are steel and aluminium.</p>

<p>We source these materials from our supplier, Company A. The terms of sales and pricing are negotiated with Company A on a transaction by transaction basis.</p>

<h4>Non-Confidential Version</h4>

<p>The main inputs for our production process are steel and aluminium .</p>

<p>We source these materials from [redacted â commercially sensitive information]. The terms of sales and pricing are negotiated with [redacted â commercially sensitive information] on a transaction by transaction basis.</p>

<h3>How to provide non-confidential versions of numerical data</h3>

<p>To create a non-confidential version of numerical data, you should generally provide either a detailed indexing of the data or use ranged values. Where this is not possible, you can provide a summary of the type of data removed or, in exceptional circumstances, a written statement of reasons explaining why we should treat that information as confidential and why that information cannot be summarised.</p>

<h4>Indexing</h4>

<p>This allows you to set a baseline figure for an initial number and show relative increases or decreases in figures over a period of time.</p>

<h4>Example of confidential information:</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Year 1</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 2</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Â£20.00</td>
      <td>Â£30.00</td>
      <td>Â£40.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This could be represented in a non-confidential summary like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Year 1</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 2</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>150</td>
      <td>200</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Ranges</h4>

<p>You can also use ranged values. This means providing a range of two numbers, one higher and one lower than the confidential figure. This range should give a reasonable summary of the data provided, with each number generally being within 15% of the confidential figure where appropriate. The true value should not always be the midpoint of the range.</p>

<h4>Example of a confidential figure:</h4>

<p>âThe sales price is Â£215 per tonne.â</p>

<h4>Non-confidential summary:</h4>

<p>âThe sales price is [commercially sensitive data: non-confidential range: Â£200 â Â£240] per tonne.â</p>

<p>Sometimes it will not be possible to use indexing or ranges. In this case, you should redact the data with an accompanying explanation.</p>

<h3>How to provide non-confidential versions of charts</h3>

<p>To make charts non-confidential, you may only need to remove the numbers on the Y axis. Please avoid any breaks in the Y axis and label it with zero so that the scale of changes can still be understood.</p>

<h3>Exceptional circumstances and providing a statement of reasons</h3>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, you may find it impossible to summarise your confidential information. If that is the case, please provide a âstatement of reasonsâ describing why that information is confidential and why providing a non-confidential summary of that information is not possible. The statement of reasons should sit within the non-confidential document itself.</p>

<p>A statement of reasons should not be provided simply on the basis that providing a non-confidential summary would be burdensome or costly. You must demonstrate that it is not possible to present the information in a non-confidential way, or with sufficient detail to allow a reasonable understanding of the information in the confidential version.</p>

<h4>Examples of where it may be appropriate to provide a statement of reasons</h4>

<p>It may be appropriate to provide a statement of reasons if it is not possible to delete or redact the confidential sections of a document in a way that would allow a reasonable understanding of the information.</p>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<p>In the confidential version, a contract between the producer and their supplier is provided.</p>

<p>In this case, it may be appropriate to provide a statement of reasons which states that a contract with your supplier was submitted in the confidential version, in general terms what the substance of that contract related to (for example, the supply of raw materials) and why it was not possible to provide a non-confidential version.</p>

<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<p>In the confidential version, a price list of products from a supplier has been provided.</p>

<p>In this case, it may be appropriate to provide a statement of reasons which states that you have provided a price list of products from your supplier and explains why it was not possible to provide a non-confidential version.</p>

<h2>Hearings</h2>

<h3>Arrangements for hearings</h3>

<p>We may conduct hearings at any time during an investigation. An interested party may request a hearing, or we may hold one on our own initiative.  You can find out more about our arrangements for hearings in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/meetings-hearings-and-visits">guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Determinations, conclusion of investigations and time limits</h2>

<p>Once we have assessed whether measures are needed, in some cases we will submit a provisional affirmative determination. This will contain our recommendation to the Secretary of State about whether to request a guarantee from importers to cover the duty amount they would incur if measures were finalised.</p>

<p>Before publishing a final determination, we will publish a Statement of Essential Facts setting out the detailed reasoning of how we came to our decision. Interested parties will have the opportunity to provide comments and submissions on this.</p>

<p>After considering these comments and submissions, we will then publish a final determination. This will set out our final recommendation of measures to the Secretary of State.</p>

<h3>Provisional affirmative determination and measures</h3>

<p>For information on how this applies to safeguard investigations, please see our safeguard guidance.</p>

<h4>Provisional affirmative determinations</h4>
<p>In a dumping or subsidy investigation, a provisional affirmative determination) is an affirmative determination made before the final determination and based on evidence then before us that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dumped/subsidised goods have been or are being imported into the UK
and</li>
  <li>we are satisfied that these are causing or have caused injury to UK industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will not make a provisional affirmative determination without making sure that interested parties have been given adequate opportunity to comment through our online platform. In subsidy investigations, we will also give the foreign government reasonable opportunity for consultation beforehand.</p>

<h4>Provisional Remedies</h4>

<p>When we make a provisional affirmative determination, we may submit a recommendation for a provisional remedy to the Secretary of State. This will take the form of requiring a guarantee from the importers of the goods concerned. We will only make a recommendation for a provisional remedy if we are satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is necessary to prevent injury being caused during the investigation to a UK industry in the relevant goods</li>
  <li>meets the economic interest test</li>
</ul>

<p>If the recommendation is rejected, the Secretary of State will publish notice of our provisional affirmative determination, the recommendation and the rejection. They will then notify interested parties and lay a statement in the House of Commons, setting out their reasons for rejecting the recommendation.</p>

<p>If the recommendation is accepted, the Secretary of State will publish notice of our provisional affirmative determination and of the recommendation. They will then publish a notice requiring all importers of the goods to give a guarantee and will also notify interested parties.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may decide not to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State even where we have made a provisional affirmative determination. This will be because the economic interest test has not been met. In these cases, we will publish a notice of our determination. In these cases, we will then notify the Secretary of State and interested parties.</p>

<h3>Statement of Essential Facts</h3>

<p>We will inform parties of the facts which form the basis for our decision on whether to recommend definitive measures. This will take the form of a Statement of Essential Facts which we will send to parties before we issue our final determination. For safeguard investigations, this is known as a Statement of Intended Final Determination. This will set out the intended final determination and a summary of the facts we considered during the investigation, including those that formed the basis of the intended final determination.</p>

<p>The Statement of Essential Facts provides relevant parties with the opportunity to comment on the information and our calculations before the final determination.</p>

<h3>Final determination</h3>

<p>When we recommend final measures, we will submit the recommendation to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may reject the recommendation only if they are satisfied that it is not in the public interest to do so.</p>

<p>If the recommendation is rejected, the Secretary of State will publish notice of our definitive affirmative determination, the recommendation and the rejection. They will then notify interested parties and lay a statement in the House of Commons setting out their reasons for rejecting the recommendation.</p>

<p>If the recommendation is accepted, the Secretary of State will publish notice of our final affirmative determination and of the recommendation. They will also notify interested parties.</p>

<p>We will include a summary of the investigations and reasons for our findings in any notices on our determination and the Secretary of Stateâs final decision on the definitive measures.</p>

<h3>Termination of investigation without recommending measures</h3>

<p>We will terminate a dumping or subsidy investigation if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we make a final negative determination</li>
  <li>we could not recommend a duty amount (for example, if the proposed measure fails the economic interest test)</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State rejects our recommendation</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also terminate an investigation if, at any stage during the investigation, we find that the dumping margin or subsidy amount for all relevant goods (cumulatively and per country) is minimal. A dumping margin is minimal if it is less than 2% of the export price. A subsidy amount is minimal where it is less than 1% ad valorem (2% for developing countries).</p>

<p>We will also terminate an investigation if the volume of dumped goods or subsidised imports is negligible. This applies where dumped or subsidised imports from the country under investigation account for less than 3% of total imports of the like goods to the UK. This does not apply however where imports from exporting countries individually account for less than 3% of total imports of the like goods to the UK, but collectively account for more than 7% (less than 4% individually but more than 9% collectively for subsidised imports from developing countries).</p>

<p>We will terminate an investigation where we find that the injury is negligible.</p>

<p>We may also, where appropriate, terminate an investigation at the request of the UK industry that applied for the remedy.</p>

<p>When any of these situations arise, we will publish a notice of our determination, then notify the Secretary of State and interested parties accordingly.</p>

<h2>If you disagree with a trade remedies decision</h2>
<p>This guidance applies to trade remedies decisions taken by the Secretary of State for International Trade and by the TRA.</p>

<p>If you disagree with a decision taken by the TRA, you may be able to ask for it to be reconsidered. For further information on this, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-handle-requests-for-reconsiderations-of-our-decisions">guidance on reconsiderations</a>.</p>

<p>You may also be able to appeal to the Tax and Chancery Chamber of the UKâs Upper Tribunal.</p>

<p>You can do this if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have already followed the reconsideration process for this decision</li>
  <li>you have asked for the decision to be reconsidered and your application has been rejected</li>
  <li>you want to appeal a trade remedies decision made by the Secretary of State for International Trade</li>
</ul>

<h3>What decisions can I challenge?</h3>

<p>A full list of the decisions that can be reconsidered and appealed is set out at Schedules 1 and 2 of the Trade Remedies (Reconsideration and Appeals) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.</p>

<p>In most cases, anyone who was an interested party in the original investigation can appeal.  Interested parties may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a foreign government</li>
  <li>overseas exporters or importers</li>
  <li>UK producers</li>
  <li>a trade or business association of those producers, overseas exporters or importers</li>
</ul>

<p>For some decisions, an appeal can only be lodged by whoever applied for reconsideration of the original decision.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a decision to reject an application for a dumping, subsidisation or safeguard investigation</li>
  <li>a decision to reject an application for review of a dumping or countervailing measure</li>
  <li>a decision to reject an application for an extension review of a safeguard measure</li>
  <li>a decision to reject an application for reconsideration that is submitted late or that does not meet the criteria set out in the regulations</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to appeal</h3>

<p>To appeal to the Upper Tribunal, you will need to complete a notice of appeal form.  For more details read the <a class="govuk-link" href="/tax-upper-tribunal">guidance on how the Tribunal works</a>.</p>

<p>The Tribunal cannot give you legal advice.</p>

<p>Your completed form must be sent to the Tribunal so that it is received no later than one month after:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date on which notice of the decision you wish to appeal is published or, if later, the date on which the notice comes into effect; or</li>
  <li>if the decision does not need to be published, the date on which you were notified of the decision</li>
</ul>

<h3>What can the Upper Tribunal decide?</h3>

<p>When making a decision, the Upper Tribunal must apply the same principles as would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review.</p>

<p>At the end of the appeal process, the Tribunal can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dismiss the appeal</li>
  <li>set aside all or part of the decision to which the appeal relates</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Tribunal sets aside all or part of a decision, it will refer the matter back to the decision-maker and order them to make a new decision in accordance with the Tribunalâs ruling.</p>
