<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/22/schedule/4/enacted" rel="external">Part 4 of Schedule 4 Taxation Act</a> covers reviews of anti-dumping and countervailing duties.</p>

<h3>Secondary legislation in the Trade Remedies (Dumping and Subsidisation) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the D&amp;S Regs)</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/450/part/7/made" rel="external">Part 7 of the D&amp;S Regs</a> contains regulations to review existing anti-dumping and countervailing amounts. These include regulations covering the initiation and conduct of reviews in general (regulations 67 and 68). They also include specific regulation for an interim review (regulation 69).</p>

<h3>World Trade Organization (WTO)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47.pdf" rel="external">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994</a> (Anti-Dumping Agreement or ADA), particularly Article 9 and Article 11</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/24-scm.pdf" rel="external">Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement)</a>, particularly Article 19 and Article 21 reflect the requirement for member countries to review measures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction to interim reviews</h2>
<p>An interim review investigates whether an existing anti-dumping or countervailing measure should be varied or revoked due to a change of circumstances.</p>

<p>When we carry out an interim review, we consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the measure continues to be either necessary or at a sufficient level to offset dumping or the importation of subsidised goods which has caused or is causing injury to a UK industry in the goods</li>
  <li>whether the measure is having the effect of removing the injury to the UK industry</li>
</ul>

<p>We may initiate an interim review of a measure on our own initiative – or we can do so following an application made by or on behalf of an interested party, so long as it is at least a year since the measure was imposed or previously altered.</p>

<p>Once we have completed our review, we will make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for International Trade to either maintain, vary or revoke the measure.</p>

<h2>Applying for an interim review</h2>

<p>Interested parties can apply for an interim review of an existing anti-dumping or countervailing measure by completing the form on our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>.</p>

<p>You might want to apply for an interim review if you think the measure is not at the right level to offset injury caused by the dumped or subsidised goods or if you think the measure is no longer needed.</p>

<p>In your application, you must provide evidence that since the measure was put in place, there has been a change in circumstances which is of a lasting nature, and that one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the continued imposition of the measure is not necessary to offset the relevant dumping or subsidisation</li>
  <li>the injury would be unlikely to continue or recur if the measure were removed or varied</li>
  <li>the measure is not sufficient to offset the injury caused by the dumped goods or subsidised imports</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to provide both a confidential and a non-confidential version of the application – these should be submitted through our online Trade Remedies Service. We will then assess your information to decide whether to initiate an interim review.</p>

<p>If your application does not contain sufficient evidence to substantiate the need for an interim review, we may reject it.</p>

<p>Other situations where we may reject an application for an interim review include if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the application relates to a temporary change in circumstances rather than a long-lasting one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have already conducted a review (or rejected a previous review application) relating to a similar issue and circumstances have not changed since then</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information the application relies on could have been provided to us in the original investigation or a previous review</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we reject your interim review application, we will notify you, setting out the reasons for our decision.</p>

<h2>Our interim review process</h2>

<p>When we initiate an interim review, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publish a notice of initiation through our online platform</li>
  <li>notify interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we publish our notice of initiation, interested parties and contributors can register their interest in the review. They can do this through our online platform.</p>

<p>To help us carry out our review, we will send a questionnaire to interested parties and contributors who register their interest to gather relevant information.</p>

<p>We will assess information we receive from questionnaires, during visits and from other appropriate sources to determine whether a change of circumstances should cause the existing measure to be maintained, varied or revoked. We may also consider, among other things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the circumstances in respect of the dumped goods or subsidised imports have changed significantly</li>
  <li>whether the circumstances in respect of injury to the UK industry, caused by the dumped goods or subsidised imports have changed significantly</li>
  <li>whether the existing measure is necessary or sufficient to offset or prevent the injury</li>
  <li>whether, and if so to what level, it is appropriate to vary the anti-dumping amount or countervailing amount</li>
</ul>

<p>We must consider both the current and prospective impact of the measure.</p>

<p>We will only make a determination to vary the anti-dumping amount or countervailing amount if we have reassessed the margin of dumping or the amount of subsidy, and the amount adequate to remove the injury.
We will only recommend varying the anti-dumping amount or countervailing amount if we are satisfied that this is in the UK’s economic interest.</p>

<h2>Making our recommendation</h2>

<p>We will publish a Statement of Essential Facts through our online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/" rel="external">Trade Remedies Service</a>. which will set out our proposed recommendation, a summary of the facts we have considered during our review and how we have used these facts to reach our decision. We will include details of the assessment which formed the basis for our recommendation.</p>

<p>We will inform interested parties and invite them to comment and provide evidence on the statement within an agreed period. We will then consider these comments before reaching our final recommendation.</p>

<p>Following this process, we will make our recommendation to the Secretary of State for International Trade. The Secretary of State will give effect to this by issuing a public notice, unless they are satisfied that it is not in the public interest to do so. Interested parties will be notified of the decision.</p>
