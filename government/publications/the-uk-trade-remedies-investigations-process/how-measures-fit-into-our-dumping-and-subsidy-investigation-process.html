<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Once we have established that dumped or subsidised imports are causing injury to UK industries and a remedy is appropriate to counter it, we may recommend a trade remedy measure to the Secretary of State for International Trade. This is likely to take the form of additional duties on those imports at the border. In dumping cases, these are called anti-dumping (AD) measures and in subsidy cases, they are called countervailing (CV) measures.</p>

<p>This guidance is about the types of trade remedy measure we may recommend and how we determine them. It covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how and when we recommend a measure</li>
  <li>how we determine what measure to recommend</li>
  <li>types of trade remedies measure(s) we recommend</li>
  <li>what happens when we review an existing measure</li>
</ul>

<p>Information on safeguard measures can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-carry-out-a-safeguards-investigation">how we carry out a safeguards investigation</a> guidance.</p>

<h4>Primary legislation in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (the Taxation Act)</h4>

<p>Forms of measures in dumping and subsidy investigations are referenced under Parts 3 and 4 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/22/schedule/4/enacted" rel="external">Schedule 4 to the Taxation Act</a>.</p>

<h3>How measures fit into our investigations process</h3>

<p>When we conclude an investigation into imported goods, we will consider what measure(s) may be appropriate to counter injury caused by the dumped or subsidised imports.</p>

<p>If we decide to recommend a measure, we will specify the type, level and duration of the measure, the goods it applies to and specific duty levels for different exporters, where appropriate.</p>

<h4>Applying the Economic Interest Test</h4>

<p>To understand how measures are considered in the Economic Interest Test (EIT) see our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-apply-the-economic-interest-test#how-we-reach-a-conclusion-on-the-eit">how we reach a conclusion on the EIT</a>.</p>

<h4>Provisional measures</h4>

<p>In some cases, we will submit a provisional determination to the Secretary of State. You can find out more information about provisional determinations in our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/an-introduction-to-our-investigations-process#determinations-and-conclusion-of-investigations">determinations and conclusion of investigations</a>.  Provisional anti-dumping measures can be applied to goods for up to six months and extended up to a maximum of nine months. Provisional countervailing measures can be applied for up to four months. We may not impose these measures immediately – instead, we may ask the importers to provide a guarantee to cover the duty amount they would incur if measures were made final.</p>

<h4>Definitive measures</h4>
<p>Before we issue our final determination, we will publish a Statement of Essential Facts to tell interested parties and contributors to the investigation about the basis of our decision whether to recommend trade remedies measures. You can find out more information about final determinations in our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/an-introduction-to-our-investigations-process#determinations-and-conclusion-of-investigations">determinations and conclusion of investigations</a>.</p>

<p>If the Secretary of State accepts our recommendation, the measures will start to apply the day after the Secretary of State’s notice is published. Our recommended measures should be applied to all the goods that are subject to the investigation (this information is specified in the Notice of Initiation we publish when we begin an investigation). We may make different recommendations for specified exporters, or certain foreign countries or territories, or categories of goods.</p>

<p>We can recommend that a measure be applied to goods for a maximum period of five years. However, we may recommend a shorter period if we think that would be enough to remedy the injury to the UK industry being caused by the dumped or subsidised goods.</p>

<h4>Agreeing an undertaking</h4>

<p>In some cases, we may agree to an undertaking instead of applying a measure. This is an agreement made by the exporter to revise the prices of the dumped goods or subsidised imports or to cease the export of the goods to the UK. In a case involving subsidised imports, it may be an agreement with the relevant foreign government to stop or reduce the subsidisation of the goods being exported to the UK.</p>

<h3>How we determine what measure to recommend</h3>

<p>This section describes how we determine the type of measure to recommend, the levels at which duties should be set and other aspects of the measure.</p>

<h4>Defining the level of duty</h4>

<p>When we calculate what level of duty to apply to dumped or subsidised imports we are investigating, we will take into account the value, weight and/or volume of the goods concerned in our investigation. We will use the Lesser Duty Rule, which means that the recommended level of duty will not exceed the dumping margin/the amount of subsidy being applied to the goods (depending on the type of case) or the injury margin – whichever is the lower.</p>

<h3>Types of measures we may recommend</h3>

<p>We will decide the most appropriate type of measure to apply on a case-by-case basis, taking into account any evidence submitted by interested parties.</p>

<p>Some types of measure we may recommend are described below.</p>

<h3>Ad valorem duties</h3>

<p>An ad valorem duty is one that is calculated as a proportion of the value of the goods concerned in our investigation. We will base our calculation on the lower of the dumping margin or amount of subsidy (depending on the type of case) and the injury margin, which is expressed as a percentage (the Lesser Duty Rule). This amount is added to the price of each import at the border. This means that the effective rate is the same no matter what the price is and allows the measure to keep up with changes in the market, such as inflation.</p>

<h3>Specific duties (also known as fixed duties)</h3>

<p>A specific level of duty is added for each unit of the product imported. The duty is based on quantity rather than value.</p>

<p>A specific duty may be appropriate when goods come in a form mixed with other products, making it hard to determine the value of the individual products. For example, it is hard to determine the value of a chemical when it is mixed in with other chemicals. However, the volume would be easier to determine, so it makes sense to recommend a measure based on quantity.</p>

<h4>Variable Duty – minimum import price</h4>

<p>This is a type of variable duty which enforces a minimum import price (MIP) by applying a duty if the price of an import falls below a certain level. We calculate the MIP using data gathered during our investigation, including the target price, to arrive at a market-wide price for a particular set of imported goods to be sold at. If the goods are sold at a lower price, the importer must pay the difference.   You can find out more about the target price in our  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-assess-injury#how-we-calculate-the-injury-margin">guidance on how we assess injury</a>.</p>

<h4>Mixed duty (also known as combination duty)</h4>

<p>We can use ad valorem duties, specific duties and Minimum Import Prices in combination. We may do this when the individual measures listed above on their own are not suitable.</p>

<h3>Other issues we consider when we recommend a measure</h3>

<h4>Applying our measures to certain goods</h4>

<p>We may apply different levels of duty to goods within a category. You can find out more about applying our measures to certain goods in our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-apply-the-economic-interest-test#how-we-reach-a-conclusion-on-the-eit">how we reach a conclusion on the EIT</a>.  We may also remove goods with certain Product Control Numbers (PCNs) from the duty. You can find out more about PCNs in our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-assess-injury#how-we-calculate-the-injury-margin">how we assess injury</a>.</p>

<h4>Imposing retrospective measures</h4>

<p>We may recommend imposing a dumping or countervailing measure retrospectively, in exceptional circumstances. For example, where there is a history of dumping which caused injury, the injury has been caused by a massive volume of dumped or subsidised goods, or there is a rapid build-up of inventories of the dumped goods. The duties will be applied to a specified volume of goods from particular exporters for a defined period. The duties can continue to be applied for up to 90 days before provisional measures are applied.</p>

<h4>Simultaneous application of measures</h4>

<p>We may apply an anti-dumping measure and a countervailing measure to the same product if it has been subject to separate dumping and subsidy investigations. However, the total amount of both measures applied should be no more than the amount needed to remove the injury caused to the UK industry by the dumping and the importation of subsidised goods.</p>

<h3>Reviews and how they affect measures</h3>

<p>We sometimes undertake reviews to determine whether a measure should continue to apply to goods. You can find out more about this in our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-trade-remedies-investigations-process/how-we-carry-out-transition-reviews-into-eu-measures#our-transition-review-process">how we carry out transition reviews into EU measures</a>.</p>
