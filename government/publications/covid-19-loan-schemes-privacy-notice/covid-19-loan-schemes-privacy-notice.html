<h2>Data protection principles</h2>

<p>We will comply with data protection law. This says that the personal information we hold about you must be:</p>

<h2>The kind of information we hold about you</h2>

<ul>
  <li>we need to comply with a legal obligation</li>
  <li>it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of our official authority as a government department</li>
  <li>it is necessary for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences including fraud</li>

      <li>bringing civil proceedings as a result of fraud</li>
      <li>taking administrative action in connection with fraud</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How we use particularly sensitive personal information</h3>

<p>Special categories of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information.</p>

<p>We will, if necessary, process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where we need to carry out our legal obligations and it is in line with our data protection policy</li>

    <ul>
      <li>performing our functions as a government department</li>
      <li>the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences</li>
      <li>preventing or detecting unlawful acts</li>
      <li>preventing or detecting fraud</li>

  <li>where we have your explicit consent to do so - we do not require your explicit consent where any of the above apply</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information about criminal convictions</h3>

<p>We will only use information relating to criminal convictions or alleged criminal behaviour where the law allows us to do so. This can arise when it is necessary for us to carry out our official functions.</p>

<p>We will only collect information about criminal convictions or allegations of criminal behaviour where it is appropriate and where we are legally able to do so.</p>

<p>We are allowed to use your personal information in this way where it is in line with our data protection policy.</p>

<h2>Lawful basis for processing</h2>

<h3>Legal basis for processing personal data for non-law enforcement purposes</h3>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> processes personal data for non-law enforcement purposes, the processing will fall under the UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and the Data Protection Act 2018 (<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018). There are a number of requirements listed in the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 to ensure this is lawful. <a href="#annex-a-detailed-explanation-of-the-legal-basis-for-processing--non-law-enforcement-purposes" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a> provides a detailed explanation of how <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> achieves this.</p>

<h3>Legal basis for processing personal data for law enforcement purposes</h3>

<p>As part of our responsibilities under the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 loan schemes, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> plays an enforcement role to protect the government guarantee to lenders in respect of loans provided to borrowers.</p>

<p>The processing will fall under Part 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018 as <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> processes data for the purpose of conducting criminal investigations and/or prosecutions. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is a competent authority for the purposes of the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018.</p>

<p>Where an investigation is of a civil nature or in relation to civil litigation, processing is subject to the UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>. Processing in the context of a criminal investigation or proceedings will be subject to provisions of the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018.</p>

<p><a href="#annex-b---detailed-explanation-of-the-legal-basis-for-processing--law-enforcement-purposes" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a> provides a more detailed explanation of the legal basis for processing.</p>

<h2>Data sharing</h2>

<p>We will not share your information with any third parties for the purposes of direct marketing.</p>

<p>We use data processors who are third parties who provide elements of services for us. We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we are legally obliged to share information. For example, we might also share information with other regulatory bodies in order to further their, or our, objectives. In any scenario, we will satisfy ourselves that we have a lawful basis on which to share the information and document our decision making.</p>

<p>We may also share your information for the purposes of debt recovery in circumstances where we are obliged to pay out to accredited lenders as guarantor of the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 loan schemes. If the debt remains outstanding after the specified timeframe for payment, no payment plan is in place or an agreed payment plan is not being adhered to, we may initiate formal proceedings to recover the full amount of the outstanding loan and associated interest. As a result <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will share personal data with the litigation and recovery agents it instructs in order for them to identify assets and undertake recovery action through the courts.</p>

<p>We may share data with the Bank of England. This may be as part of their responsibility to regulate and supervise accredited lenders or in their official functions to gather, analyse and publish data, which inform their policy decisions and response to key economic events or crises.</p>

<p>We will, in some circumstances and where the law allows, share your data with third parties, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>British Business Bank</li>
  <li>other government departments</li>
  <li>public authorities (including local authorities)</li>
  <li>law enforcement agencies both in the UK and overseas</li>
  <li>regulatory bodies</li>
  <li>debt collection agencies</li>
  <li>credit reference agencies</li>
  <li>anti-fraud organisations</li>
  <li>banks (including accredited lenders)</li>
  <li>other financial institutions</li>
</ul>

<h3>When we may share your personal information with third parties</h3>

<p>We will share your personal information with third parties where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>required or allowed by law</li>
  <li>it is in the public interest to do so</li>
  <li>you authorise us to do so</li>
  <li>it is necessary for the performance of our functions as a government department or a function of the Crown, another government department or another public authority</li>

  <li>your agent or legal representative</li>
</ul>

<p>Personal data shared with third parties may be disclosed onward to other third parties for specific purposes where there is a lawful basis and subject to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ authority. For example, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may disclose information obtained from <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to local authorities for certain social security, welfare and council tax purposes.</p>

<p>We will also share your personal information with the police and other law enforcement agencies where it is necessary to do so for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, and other regulatory authorities when it is necessary for the purposes of their regulatory functions.</p>

<p>This will, in some circumstances, involve sharing special categories of personal data and, where relevant, data about criminal convictions or allegations.</p>

<h3>Disclosure to a specified anti-fraud organisation - Serious Crime Act 2007</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may disclose information to a specified anti-fraud organisation (<abbr title="specified anti-fraud organisation">SAFO</abbr>) for the purposes of preventing fraud.</p>

<p>Section 68 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 was introduced as part of the government’s commitment to preventing fraud. It enables public authorities to disclose information for the purposes of preventing fraud, as a member of a <abbr title="specified anti-fraud organisation">SAFO</abbr> or otherwise in accordance with any arrangements made with such an organisation. A <abbr title="specified anti-fraud organisation">SAFO</abbr> enables or facilitates the sharing of information for the prevention of fraud and is specified by an order made by the Secretary of State. Disclosures of information from a public authority to a <abbr title="specified anti-fraud organisation">SAFO</abbr> are subject to a code of practice and this, along with a full list of <abbr title="specified anti-fraud organisations">SAFOs</abbr> we may share information with, is available on GOV.UK: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-for-the-prevention-of-fraud-code-of-practice" class="govuk-link">Data sharing for the prevention of fraud: code of practice</a>. In addition, all disclosures must be made in accordance with data protection legislation.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of information to combat fraud against the public sector</h3>

<p>Section 56 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 enables public authorities to share information in order to take action in connection with fraud against a public authority. This type of information sharing helps us to improve our ability to identify and reduce the risk of fraud against the public sector and recover public sector funds.</p>

<p>Fraud in this context means a fraud offence which involves:</p>

<p>a) loss to a public authority, or<br>
b) the exposure of a public authority to a risk of loss</p>

<p>Taking action includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preventing</li>
  <li>detecting</li>
  <li>investigating and prosecuting fraud</li>
  <li>bringing civil proceedings</li>
  <li>taking administrative action as a result of fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> has entered into information sharing under this power, it has taken steps to ensure that information sharing proposals are balanced and proportionate and come under an appropriate level of scrutiny. This includes ensuring that such arrangements are set out in appropriate information sharing agreements.</p>

<p>We only use personal information shared under this power for the purpose for which it was disclosed, unless certain exceptions apply including:</p>

<p>a) if the information has already lawfully been made available to the public<br>
b) the prevention or detection of crime<br>
c) for the purposes of a criminal investigation<br>
d) for the purposes of legal proceedings (whether civil or criminal)</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> undertakes fraud analytics in respect of data from all loan applications (company name and registration number, trading name, post code and lender demand date) for the purpose of quantifying and/or identifying fraud and to look for potential fraudulent behaviour, patterns and trends. This activity is not limited to those applications where potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity has been identified.</p>

<p>As part of the fraud data analytics programme, we share loan data with the Cabinet Office to match it with other government data sets. The results of this will be shared with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, the <abbr title="British Business Bank">BBB</abbr>, accredited lender(s) and other government bodies and law enforcement agencies as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Data security</h3>

<p>We have put in place measures to protect the security of your information.</p>

<p>Our third-party service providers will only process your personal information on our instructions or with our agreement, and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.</p>

<p>We treat the security of your data very seriously. We have strict security standards, and all our staff and other people who process personal data on our behalf get regular training about how to keep information safe.</p>

<p>Where possible the personal data is minimised, aggregated, or anonymised, for example in reporting performance, estimated losses and so on.</p>

<p>We have put in place appropriate technical, physical and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect about you.</p>

<p>In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those persons, or agents who have a business or legal need.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and the regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

<p>All organisations we work with are required to agree to move, process and destroy data securely i.e., in line with the principles set out in HM Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework" class="govuk-link">Security policy framework</a>, issued by the Cabinet Office, when handling, transferring, storing, accessing or destroying information.</p>

<h3>Retention of your personal data</h3>

<p>Personal data is retained in accordance with the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> retention and disposal policy. We aim to retain your personal information for only as long as it is necessary for us to do so for the purposes for which we are using it and in line with our retention and disposal policy.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may also tell you in other ways about the processing of your personal data.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Detailed explanation of the legal basis for processing – non-law enforcement purposes</h2>

<p>Our lawful basis for processing loans data is UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 6(1)(e) - processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, which in this case is in the exercise of a government function in the delivery of the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>-19 loan schemes.</p>

<p>For the purposes of UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 6(3) the legal basis for the establishment and operation of the fraud data analytics program for the purposes of taking action in connection with fraud, is covered by Part 5, Chapter 4, section 56 of the Digital Economy Act (DEA) 2017. This provides powers for government departments / organisations to share information for the purposes of taking of action in connection with fraud against a public authority.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> also relies on the following legal bases under Article 6(1) of the UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> (depending on the context of the data processing) where processing personal data for non-law enforcement purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>6(1)(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes</li>
  <li>6(1)(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject</li>
  <li>6(1)(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller</li>
  <li>6(1)(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, particularly where the individual is a child</li>
</ul>

<p>Where <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> relies on legitimate interests as a reason for processing data, it has considered whether or not those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of individuals and has concluded that they are not.</p>

<p>In addition, where the processing for any of the non-law enforcement purposes is sensitive processing, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> processes data under the following article 9(2) conditions of the UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where we have your explicit consent, this will be appropriately documented, and you will be able to ‘opt out’ at any time</li>
  <li>where processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity</li>
  <li>where processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest</li>
</ul>

<p>In order for <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to process special category data for reasons of substantial public interest, the processing must meet one of the conditions set out in Part 2, Schedule 1.</p>

<p>The condition(s) <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> relies on in Schedule 1 will depend on the context of the data processing concerned.</p>

<h3>Archiving, research and statistics</h3>

<p>In order for <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to process special category data in reliance upon this Article 9 condition, the processing must meet one of the conditions set out in Part 1, Schedule 1. This applies where the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> transfers material to the National Archives.</p>

<p>Read our appropriate policy document to find out how <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> processes special category data.</p>

<h2>Annex B - Detailed explanation of the legal basis for processing – law enforcement purposes</h2>

<p>As a United Kingdom government department (Data Protection Act 2018, section 30 and Schedule 7(1)), <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is a competent authority for the purpose of Part 3 of the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 which applies to the processing of personal data by such authorities for law enforcement purposes.</p>

<p>These purposes are set out at s.31 <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 and are the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, which might include the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.</p>

<p>Our processing is either done because it is necessary for the performance of a task relating to one of these purposes (s.35(2)(b) <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018) or with the consent of the individual (s.35(2)(a) <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018).</p>

<p>We process personal data for the purposes of law enforcement in the following 3 areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>criminal investigations</li>
  <li>intelligence</li>
  <li>financial recovery</li>
</ul>

<p>Our processing can also include sensitive processing which means processing special category data for law enforcement purposes.  Where this is the case, we rely on either the consent of the individual (s.32(4)) or, provided the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purposes, on a condition set out in Schedule 8 of the <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 (s.35(5).</p>

<p>The relevant conditions in schedule 8 of the Data Protection Act 2018 are:</p>

<p>i. for statutory purposes where <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is processing data through exercising powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (to conduct cases that involve the proceeds of crime) or any other relevant law, and where case teams ensure processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.</p>

<p>ii. for the administration of justice.</p>

<p>iii. for the safeguarding of children and of individuals at risk where the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is processing data of victims, witnesses or other individuals connected to investigations and prosecutions who are under 18 or are considered vulnerable or at risk. The <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> case teams will ensure that processing is necessary for <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to effectively investigate offences and fulfil our statutory function, and handle consent in line with the Victims’ Code of Practice.</p>

<p>iv. personal data already in the public domain - this condition is met if the processing relates to personal data which is manifestly made public by the data subject.</p>

<p>v. preventing fraud – where it is necessary to prevent fraud, and</p>

<p>a) consists of—<br>
i) the disclosure of personal data by a competent authority as a member of an anti-fraud organisation
<br>
ii) the disclosure of personal data by a competent authority in accordance with arrangements made by an anti-fraud organisation
<br>
iii) the processing of personal data disclosed as described in sub-paragraph (i) or (ii)</p>

<p>An ‘anti-fraud organisation’ has the same meaning as in section 68 of the Serious Crime Act 2007.</p>

<p>vi. Legal claims – where it is necessary for or in connection with legal proceedings or to obtain legal advice or to establish, exercise or defend legal rights.</p>

<p>vii. For Archiving purposes where data is contained within files that meet the criteria of ‘long term interest’ defined by the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Retention Schedule and will therefore be transferred to The National Archives (TNA) under the Public Records Act 1958. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will make decisions as to the archiving of data under the guidance of the Keeper of Public Records.</p>
