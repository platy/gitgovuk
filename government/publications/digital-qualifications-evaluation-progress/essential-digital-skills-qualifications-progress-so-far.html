<p>In April 2019 we published the rules against which we will regulate the new Essential Digital Skills qualifications (EDSQs). At the same time, the Department for Education published the national standards for essential digital skills which awarding organisation must use to develop their qualifications.</p>

<p>All new EDSQs will go through a technical evaluation process before being made available to centres (schools, colleges and training providers) to deliver. This is to ensure that the qualifications are valid and fit for purpose. Using a combination of subject and assessment experts, we review the materials submitted by each awarding organisation against our rules. These materials include the specification and the sample assessments. We consider issues such as their level of demand, coverage of the Department for Education national standards, and the quality of the questions and the associated mark schemes. We also review the awarding organisation’s assessment strategy, the key document in which they explain the approach they are proposing to the design and delivery of their qualification.</p>

<h2>Evaluation progress</h2>

<p>The status, as at 24 August 2022, of each of the qualifications that awarding organisations have notified Ofqual they are developing is as follows.</p>
