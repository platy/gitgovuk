<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 009x series Procedure Codes for Data Element 1/10 for Final Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>).</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>0090: Final Supplementary Declaration (<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>) Reports</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cds-declaration-completion-instructions-for-final-supplementary-declarations">CDS Declaration Completion Instructions for Final Supplementary Declarations</a>.</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in DE 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in DE 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-code-for-final-supplementary-declarations">DE 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes</a> and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for DE 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">0090: </span> Final Supplementary Declaration (<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>) Reports</h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cds-declaration-completion-instructions-for-final-supplementary-declarations">CDS Declaration Completion Instructions for Final Supplementary Declarations</a>. These are additional notes on specific data elements in relation to this Procedure Code and do not constitute full guidance on how the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>Northern Ireland (NI): The use of this Procedure Code is a declaration that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Great Britain (GB): The use of this Procedure Code is a declaration that the conditions laid down in Taxation (Cross-Border trade) Act 2018, Section 23 and Schedule 1 are met.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code is for the provision of <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> reports for Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) Regular Use and Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in the Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code is only to be used to support the submission of the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> Reports.</p>

<p>A valid SDP (Regular Use) or <abbr title="Entry in the Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> authorisation must be held.</p>

<p>If the authorisation states the standard customs reporting period is to be used for the Final Supplementary Declaration (<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>), an <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> must be submitted per authorised <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> by the fourth working day of the month following the end of the reporting period, showing the number of Supplementary Declarations due/submitted during the reporting period.</p>

<p>Where an authorisation covers multiple branches, a separate <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> should be submitted for each branch.</p>

<p>Where an authorisation is held for non-standard reporting periods, one FSDs per authorised <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification number">EORI</abbr> should be submitted for each reporting period according to the timescales specified in each individual authorisation.</p>

<p>Where both <abbr title="Entry in the Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> and SDP authorisations are held, the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> submitted must include the return for both types of simplified procedure within the same <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Nil returns are required in all instances.</p>

<p>These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> (DE 1/11).</p>

<p>All goods (excise and non-excise) must be reported on a single <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> report.</p>

<h3>Restrictions:</h3>

<p>Any supplementary declarations for a particular reporting period sent after the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> has been transmitted should be recorded as Late Submissions on the following reporting periods <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where an Agent or Representative is submitting the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>, the holder of the authorisation must be declared in DE 3/20 and the Agent or the Representative must be declared in DE 3/18.</p>

<p>Indirect Representation is not permitted.</p>
