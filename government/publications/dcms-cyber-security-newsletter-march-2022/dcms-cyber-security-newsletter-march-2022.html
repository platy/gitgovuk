<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Director’s message</h2>

<p>Firstly, the invasion of Ukraine concerns us all. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences" rel="external">The National Cyber Security Centre is urging all UK organisations to bolster their cyber security resilience</a> and has issued new guidance to reduce the risk of an attack. I encourage you all to read it and share it with your networks and suppliers.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of my job is getting to meet the many innovative cyber companies based around the UK. From startups fresh out of university with new products and ideas to established primes employing hundreds of people, it’s great to learn about the work that is driving this thriving and increasingly critical sector. That is why I am pleased to see the positive story of growth in this year’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=b52478dfdf&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Cyber Security Sectoral Analysis</a>. Over the past twelve months revenue in the cyber sector has grown to more than £10bn for the first time and it now employs the equivalent of 52,700 full time roles, an increase of 6,000 over the last year. The analysis also reveals that more than half of cyber companies are based outside of London and the South East, showing how cyber is helping to develop local economies and creating good jobs all across the country.</p>

<p>But the analysis also revealed that only a third of our cyber sector companies are confident they will be able to attract the skilled staff they need to continue this growth. Creating clear pathways into the profession is therefore one of our priorities at DCMS. Last month, to encourage more young people to engage with cyber security, we launched <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68bdd47429d46bef88c3c9249&amp;id=7967a25514&amp;e=06bf24ee7b" rel="external">Cyber Explorers</a>, a new free online learning platform for 11-14 year olds. Using characters, quizzes and activities, the website will show students how digital, computing and cyber skills can lead to a range of exciting careers, both in cyber and other areas such as medical research and sports technology.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Ukraine invasion: NCSC urges UK organisations to bolster cyber defences</h2>

<p>Following Russia’s further violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/organisations-urged-to-bolster-defences" rel="external">the National Cyber Security Centre has called on organisations in the UK to bolster their online defences</a>.</p>

<p>While the NCSC is not aware of any current specific threats to UK organisations in relation to events in and around Ukraine, there has been an historical pattern of cyber attacks on Ukraine with international consequences.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/actions-to-take-when-the-cyber-threat-is-heightened" rel="external">The guidance</a> encourages organisations to follow actionable steps that reduce the risk of falling victim to an attack.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>UK cyber security sectoral analysis 2022</h2>

<p>Last month we published our latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-levels-of-investment-for-uks-101-billion-cyber-security-sector">Cyber Sectoral Analysis</a>, our annual research report into the UK’s cyber sector. The analysis has tracked the growth in the cyber sector since 2018 and highlights the impressive performance of many of our firms, and their steadfast resilience in recent years.</p>

<p>In the last 12 months, the sector has demonstrated double-digit growth across a number of measures and we are now tracking over 1,800 companies. The sector’s revenue has grown to more than £10 billion for the first time, and the sector has added over 6,000 jobs. 2021 was also a record year for external investment into the sector – with over £1 billion raised by firms across the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Cyber Explorers: new schools programme</h2>

<p>DCMS has launched a new free learning platform for young people aged 11 to 14 called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/free-cyber-skills-training-for-thousands-of-school-pupils">Cyber Explorers</a>. Cyber Explorers uses characters, quizzes and activities to show students how digital, computing and cyber skills can lead to a range of career paths, including social media content creation, sports technology and medical research.
The platform is part of government plans to create a highly-skilled and more diverse pipeline of talent for the UK’s fast-growing and in-demand cyber security industry. Designed to engage younger students before they choose subjects for their GCSEs and equivalent qualifications, Cyber Explorers aims to improve the diversity of pupils picking computer science courses at Key Stage 4.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Government cyber security talent scheme</h2>

<p>The government is currently recruiting people for its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.civil-service-careers.gov.uk/security-profession-apprenticeships-list/" rel="external">cyber apprenticeship and fast stream programmes</a>. Cyber Apprentices will work towards developing deep technical skills throughout the programme and beyond to become recognised cyber experts.Fast Streamers will join the government’s flagship leadership development programme that will provide the necessary skills to reach the very highest levels of the Government Security Profession.</p>

<p>Applications are open until Thu 10 March.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Digital Security by Design Workshops</h2>

<p>To help promote their work on Digital Security by Design, the initiative to transform digital infrastructure to make it more secure and to reduce existing hardware vulnerabilities, Innovate UK are hosting a series of events exploring the history of computing.</p>

<p>On Monday 21 February the programme held an event at Bletchley Park about the history of computers. You can watch a video about the event here.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill: Second Reading</h2>

<p>On Wednesday 26 January the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3069" rel="external">Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill</a> (PSTI Bill) had its second reading in Parliament. This is a landmark piece of legislation   that will improve the cyber security of connected products sold to consumers in the UK.</p>

<p>The Bill will place new cyber security requirements on the manufacturers and sellers of consumer tech which can connect to the internet or other devices. Under the bill, easy-to-guess default passwords which come programmed into digital devices and present an easy target for cybercriminals will be banned. Manufacturers will have to be more transparent to customers about the length of time products will receive security updates for connectable products, and create a better public reporting system for vulnerabilities found in those products</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Cyber Scotland Week, February 28 to March 6</h2>
