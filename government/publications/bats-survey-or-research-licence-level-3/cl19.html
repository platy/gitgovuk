<p>Class licence CL19: to survey bats of all species for scientific (including research) or educational purposes Level 3 – mist nets and acoustic lures.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This licence permits the surveying of bats using artificial light (for example, torches), endoscopes, hand, static hand-held nets, mist nets and acoustic lures. This licence may only be relied upon where surveying is carried out for scientific, research, or educational purposes. The use of mist nets is only permitted for commissioned surveys in relation to proposed developments. Users must comply with licence terms and conditions at all times, including the requirement to submit a report of licensed activities each year.</p>

<p>This licence does not permit activities licensed under the Volunteer Bat Roost Visitor licences (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-class-licence-for-volunteer-bat-roost-visitors-level-1">WML-CL15</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-class-licence-for-volunteer-bat-roost-visitors-level-2">WML-CL16</a>, which persons registered to act under these licences may rely on when undertaking official duties under Natural England’s Bat Advice contract.</p>

<p>This licence is Level 3. It does not permit Accredited Agents of the Registered Person to undertake survey works using mist nets and acoustic lures.</p>

<p>A Level 1 licence is available should surveying for bats be likely to result in disturbance only (the use of artificial light by way of torches is permitted) or when checking bat boxes (if no handling is likely to be required). A Level 2 licence is available for surveying using artificial light, endoscopes, hand and static hand-held nets (see Information and Advice note a).</p>

<p>These licences may be more suitable for many people undertaking general surveying. A Level 4 licence is available for surveying using harp traps and acoustic lures by the Registered Person only. Mist nets and harp traps may only be used for a maximum of three days at any one site under the Level 3 or Level 4 licence in surveys commissioned to inform development proposals. Should you wish to use additional equipment such as rings and tags, or to use mist nets / harp traps and lures outside the remit of the Level 3 or Level 4 class licence, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bat-licences#bat-research-project-licences">apply for a project licence</a></p>

<p>Registration: Anyone wishing to use this licence that does not currently hold a personal bat survey licence must first apply to Natural England to be registered.</p>

<p>Recording and reporting: There are data recording and annual reporting requirements.</p>

<p>Reference: WML – CL19</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Important</h3>

<p>This licence authorises acts that would otherwise be offences under the legislation referred to above. Failure to comply with its terms and conditions:<br><br>
i. may be an offence against the Habitats Regulations or the 1981 Act, or mean that the licence cannot be relied upon and an offence could therefore be committed. The maximum penalty available for an offence under Habitats Regulations or the 1981 Act is, at the time of the issue of this licence, an unlimited fine or a 6 month custodial sentence (or both);<br><br>
ii. may result in your permission to use this licence being withdrawn. Natural England will inform any person or organisation whose permission to use this licence is withdrawn in writing. This sanction may be applied to other similar licences, and<br><br>
iii. may mean that you are not able to rely on this licence as a defence in respect to the prohibitions within the Animal Welfare Act 2006 or the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996.</p>

<p>Breaching a condition of a licence issued under the 1981 Act is not in itself an offence but doing so may mean that the licence cannot be relied upon and an offence could therefore be committed.</p>

<p>If the activity that you wish to undertake is not covered by this licence, or if you are unable to comply with any of the terms and conditions which apply to the use of this licence, then you will need to apply to Natural England for an individual licence. This licence is not a consent for the purposes of Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) in respect to SSSIs. It is your responsibility to get consent or assent if required before this licence can be used on any SSSI. See Advice (u - w) for further information.</p>
</div>

<p>Issued by and on behalf of Natural England on 1 January 2022.</p>

<h2>Information and advice specific to this licence</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Working during the coronavirus pandemic</h3>

<p>Anyone acting under this licence should follow Defra’s advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-surveying-and-mitigation-works-affecting-wildlife">surveying and mitigation work during the coronavirus pandemic</a> - also available on request from Natural England: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:wildlife.scicons@naturalengland.org.uk">wildlife.scicons@naturalengland.org.uk</a>. This advice is a minimum precaution to reduce the risk of accidental transmission of the virus from humans to wild animals, and may be updated. You should check GOV.UK for guidance before you act.</p>

<p>Any products used to clean and disinfect equipment should be safe for use where there could be contact with animals, and used at an effective and safe dilution rate. ‘Safe4 Disinfectant’ is considered to be a safe and appropriate product for cleaning and disinfecting equipment that could come into contact with animals. Use at a dilution of 1:50 to be effective against COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<h3>Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 Bat Class Survey Licences</h3>

<p>a. There are four levels of Bat Class Survey Licences. These differ in the methods of surveying permitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1 (reference <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-or-research-licence-level-1">WML-CL17</a>) permits surveying which may result in disturbance only (it permits the use of artificial light, such as torches</li>
  <li>Level 2 (reference <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-or-research-licence-level-2">WML-CL18</a>) permits surveying by hand, with hand held static nets, artificial light (torches) and endoscopes</li>
  <li>Level 3 (reference <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-or-research-licence-level-3">WML-CL19</a>) permits additional survey methods using mist nets and acoustic lures and</li>
  <li>Level 4 (reference <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-or-research-licence-level-4">WML-CL20</a>) permits the use of harp traps and acoustic lures</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the Level 3 survey licence.</p>

<p>To register to use the Level 4 licence you require additional experience or training. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bat-licences#bat-research-project-licences">project licence</a> will be required should you wish to use mist nets or harp traps with or without lures for more than three days at any one site, or for purposes other than to inform development proposals, or should you wish to use rings or tags or otherwise mark bats.</p>

<h3>Guidance on surveying</h3>

<p>b. The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-2861" rel="external">Bat Workers Manual</a> is available from the JNCC website. More general advice is given in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bats-surveys-and-mitigation-for-development-projects">The Bat Mitigation Guidelines</a> and the Bat Conservation Trust’s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/guidanceforprofessionals.html" rel="external">Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice Guidelines</a> (3rd edition). You will be expected to check whether this guidance has been updated and if so, to ensure that you act in accordance with the most up to date version. Guidance note WML-G39 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140605090108/http:/www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/wmlg39_tcm6-35872.pdf" rel="external">Capture and marking of bats</a> should be followed when using harp traps and acoustic lures to capture bats.</p>

<p>c. Before exercising this licence the licensee should liaise with the appropriate local bat groups if undertaking surveys on a site which a local bat group has an interest in. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bats.org.uk/support-bats/bat-groups" rel="external">Find your local bat group</a>.</p>

<h3>Relevant legislation and good practice</h3>

<p>d. Persons acting under this licence may photograph bats in connection with licensed work provided that this causes no additional disturbance.</p>

<p>e. Natural England recommends that anyone handling bats wears gloves and is suitably vaccinated against rabies.</p>

<p>f. A licence is not required for the short-term keeping of injured bats that were obtained legally for the purpose of tending them in order to release them when no longer disabled. However, if the bats are to be kept for longer than six months then the carer should apply for a licence to possess bats. This can be done using the possession <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-protected-species-apply-for-a-licence-to-possess-them">licence application form WML-A37</a> .</p>

<p>g. Persons acting under a licence should have regard to legislation and good practice relevant to the action(s) undertaken, including animal welfare and the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (2006 Act). It is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal (including birds) under the control of man (section 4 of the 2006 Act). This applies to the humane dispatch of captured animals and the treatment of animals held in traps or nets, including decoy birds and non-target animals. The application of Animal Welfare Act 2006 to wildlife management activities is explained in Natural England leaflet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wildlife-management-advice-notice-the-animal-welfare-act-2006-wml-gu02">Wildlife management advice notice: The Animal Welfare Act 2006</a> (WML-GU02).</p>

<h3>Biosecurity</h3>

<p>h. Users of this licence should consider the risks of activities to biosecurity and take relevant precautions when visiting heathland and woodland sites to avoid the spread of invasive non-native species, and tree and plant pests and diseases such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestry.gov.uk/phytophthora" rel="external">Phytophthora</a> and Ash dieback <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara" rel="external">Chalara</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/index.cfm?sectionid=119" rel="external">General biosecurity advice</a> can be found on the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat website. Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency">plant biosecurity</a> is available on the Animal and Plant Health Agency’s website.</p>

<h3>Registering to use this licence</h3>

<p>i. Only Registered Persons, or persons authorised or supervised by a Registered Person (see Condition 5), may act under this licence. Anyone seeking to become a Registered Person must apply to Natural England. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-a-wildlife-licence">register online</a> to use this licence. Alternatively applications can be submitted by email or post (contact details below). Applications require supporting evidence (including references) indicating appropriate knowledge and experience of the species covered by this licence and the management techniques permitted (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-to-support-a-protected-species-licence">Reference guidance</a>).</p>

<p>j. Once registered, a person is entitled to use this licence so long as they satisfy the licence’s terms and conditions; annual re-registration is not required. Failure to comply by the terms and conditions, including the recording and reporting requirements, will, by default, render registration null and void. The annual reporting process is used to verify a person’s desire to remain registered.</p>

<p>k. It is the responsibility of Registered Persons to maintain their expertise at an appropriate level to act under this licence and it is also their responsibility to ensure that Accredited Agents and Assistants have appropriate training, experience and instruction to act under this licence.</p>

<p>l. Anyone seeking to confirm whether a person is registered to use this licence should contact Natural England Wildlife Licensing (contact details below).</p>

<p>m. A person’s registration may be revoked by Natural England, for example, if that person breaches the conditions of this licence. In these circumstances Natural England will normally give 28 days’ notice of our intention to revoke a person’s registration.</p>

<p>n. Registration to use this licence indicates that the licensee has demonstrated an appropriate level of competence in these activities. The licence should not be used or taken to indicate competence in any other activity that may be associated with work on bats (for example, work as a volunteer bat roost visitor or volunteer bat roost visitor trainer, for which class licences <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bat-licences#bat-survey-licences">WML-CL15 and WML-CL16 are appropriate</a>.</p>

<h2>Information and advice for all class and general licences</h2>

<h3>General information</h3>

<p>o. Natural England checks compliance with licences and the attached conditions. Where breaches are identified, these may be subject to enforcement action.</p>

<p>p. Ordinarily, licences will be reissued on 1 January each year (you do not need to re-register for those with registration requirements). Please note, however, that they can be modified or revoked at any time by Natural England or the Secretary of State, but this will not be done unless there are good reasons for doing so. You are advised to check the terms and conditions of a licence prior to your first use of it each year in case of amendments.</p>

<p>q. The common name of the species given in a licence is included by way of guidance only; in the event of any dispute or proceedings, it is the scientific name of a species only that will be taken into account.</p>

<h3>The limits of licences</h3>

<p>r. Licences permit action only for the purposes specified on that licence.</p>

<p>s. Licences do not permit actions prohibited under any other legislation, nor do they confer any right of entry upon land.</p>

<p>t. Unless otherwise stated the provisions of Natural England licences only apply landward of the mean low water mark in England. The Marine Management Organisation is responsible for all licensing seaward of the mean low water mark.</p>

<h3>Protected sites</h3>

<p>u. You can search for and view details about all <abbr title="sites of special scientific interest">SSSIs</abbr> by using Natural England’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">Designated Sites system</a>. The notification documents for each <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> contain a list of operations that require Natural England’s prior consent. Owners and occupiers of land notified as <abbr title="sites of special scientific interest">SSSIs</abbr> are required to give written notice to Natural England before either beginning any of these operations, or allowing someone else to carry out those operations. <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent can only be given to a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> owner or occupier. It may be given with or without conditions, or in some cases, consent may not be granted. A similar process applies to public bodies and statutory undertakers (as defined under Section 28G of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)) and this obligation applies even where the operations are carried out on land outside of the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>.</p>

<p>v. Please note that as the licensee you will not be able to undertake the licensed activity on a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> until the owner or occupier of the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> has applied for, and received, Natural England’s written <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent. If you do so, you may be at risk of committing an offence. As the licensee, if you wish to exercise this licence on a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> you must contact the relevant owners or occupiers of the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> and ensure they give written notice to Natural England of their proposal to permit you to carry out licensed activity on their <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>. You should wait until a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent decision has been received by the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> owner/occupier before you begin to exercise this licence on a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>. See GOV.UK for further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest">how to get <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent</a> from Natural England.</p>

<p>w. In considering whether to issue consent or assent for activities likely to affect a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> that is a European site, in other words a Special Protection Area (SPA) or Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Natural England will carry out a Habitats Regulations Assessment, as required by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended) (‘the Habitats Regulations’) to ensure there will be no adverse effects on the European site.</p>

<h2>Annex A - Recording and reporting requirements</h2>

<h3>Records</h3>

<p>Each Registered Person must maintain a record, which shall be kept for at least 24 months beyond the expiry date of this licence, of the following information for each survey undertaken using this licence (this also includes surveys conducted by Accredited Agents or Assistants acting under their authority):</p>

<ul>
  <li>date survey undertaken</li>
  <li>location (site name / county)</li>
  <li>OS grid reference of surveyed site (six-figure (minimum)</li>
  <li>methods used</li>
  <li>capture or release (specify if different)</li>
  <li>number and species of bats disturbed, taken/captured and released each time the licence was used, and</li>
  <li>details of any accidental bat deaths or injuries, whilst using this licence</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A report, detailing the information stipulated above, including ‘nil’ returns, must be sent by each Registered Person to Natural England Wildlife Licensing (contact details above) for the reporting period 1 June to 31 May no later than 30 June each year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bats-survey-or-research-licence-level-3">Application and report forms</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registered Persons (or a person acting on their behalf) must also submit data collected under this licence to the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.alerc.org.uk/" rel="external">local record centre</a>. Data for each reporting period (as detailed in 1. above) is to be submitted no later than 30 June each year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where data is not submitted to the record office by the Registered Person then the name of the person submitting data on behalf of the Registered Person must be stated in the Licence Report submitted to Natural England (see 1. above).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Commercial confidentiality</h3>

<p>If you encounter difficulties releasing data due to client confidentiality restrictions then you are advised to remind your client that it is a condition of using this licence that survey information is reported. Furthermore, the licence may only be used if this condition is met and withholding information may lead to a licence breach (which under Regulation 60 of the Habitats Regulations is an offence).</p>

<p>To help avoid such difficulties, it is recommended that your contractual terms and conditions make it clear that submitting records to Natural England and other bodies specified in licences is a legal requirement. If a client is not prepared to accept such terms and conditions then you may not use this licence without the prior permission of Natural England.</p>
