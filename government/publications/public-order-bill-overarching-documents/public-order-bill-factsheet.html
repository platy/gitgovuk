  <p>What we have seen in recent years is a rise in criminal, disruptive and self-defeating guerrilla tactics, carried out by a selfish few in the name of protest.</p>

  <p>Not only do these anti-social protests cause untold delays and misery for the law-abiding public wanting to get on with their lives, it tears police away from communities where they are needed most to prevent serious violence and neighbourhood crime.</p>

  <p class="last-child">This bill backs the police to take proactive action and prevent such disruption happening in the first place. These measures stand up for the responsible majority and it is time that Parliament got behind them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Rt Hon. Priti Patel MP, Home Secretary</h3>

<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>This government fully supports the right of individuals to engage in peaceful protest; however, the serious disruption caused by a small minority of protestors has highlighted that more needs to be done to protect the public and businesses from these unacceptable actions.</p>

<p>These new measures are needed to bolster the police’s powers to respond more effectively to disruptive and dangerous protests. Over recent years, guerrilla tactics used by a small minority of protesters have caused a disproportionate impact on the hardworking majority seeking to go about their everyday lives, cost millions in taxpayers’ money and put lives at risk. This has included halting public transport networks, disrupting fuel supplies and preventing hundreds of hard-working people from getting to their jobs. Protests such as these removes police from their regular duties tackling crime in local communities.</p>

<p>The measures in the Public Order Bill will improve the police’s ability to manage such protests and take a proactive approach to prevent such disruption happening in the first place. This in turn will ensure that police can better balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business and to focus their resources on keeping the public safe.</p>

<h2>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<h3>Introducing new criminal offences of locking-on and going equipped to lock-on.</h3>

<p>This measure criminalises the protest tactic of individuals attaching themselves to others, objects or buildings to cause serious disruption. The locking-on offence will carry a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. The maximum penalty for the offence of going equipped to lock-on will be an unlimited fine.</p>

<h3>Introducing a new offence of obstructing major transport works.</h3>

<p>This measure will cover any behaviour which obstructs or interferes with the construction or maintenance of transport projects such as HS2. This offence will attract a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.</p>

<h3>Introducing a new offence of interference with key national infrastructure.</h3>

<p>This offence  covers any behaviour which prevents  or significantly delays the operation of key infrastructure, including airports, railways, printing presses and downstream oil and gas infrastructure. This offence will attract a maximum penalty of 12 months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.</p>

<h3>Extending stop and search powers for police to search for and seize objects (such as lock-on devices) that may be used in the commission of a protest-related offence.</h3>

<p>This measure will enable the police to proactively tackle highly disruptive protesters intent on committing an offence by searching for and seizing items which are made, adapted or intended to be used in connection with protest-related offences (including those listed above). The Bill provides for both a suspicion-led power, amending section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and a suspicion-less power.</p>

<h3>Introducing Serious Disruption Prevention Orders, a new preventative court order targeting protestors who are determined to repeatedly inflict disruption on the public.</h3>

<p>This measure will allow courts to place prohibitions or requirements they consider necessary to prevent someone from causing serious disruption. These may include prohibiting an individual from being in a particular place, being with particular people, having particular articles in their possession and using the internet to facilitate or encourage person to commit a protest-related offence. The court may also require a person subject to a SDPO to wear an electronic tag. Breach of a SDPO is a criminal offence carrying a maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.</p>

<h3>Amending the seniority of police officer in London who may attach conditions to an upcoming protest or prohibit a trespassory assembly to match that applicable in forces outside of London.</h3>

<p>The current minimum rank of Assistant Commissioner will be changed to that of Commander, which is equivalent to Assistant Chief Constables outside of London. This measure will spread the burden of setting conditions on protests in London more evenly across the senior leadership of the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police.</p>

<p>The measures in the bill will apply to England and Wales only.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Current legislation to manage protests provides predominantly for powers to counter behaviours at protests which are violent or distressing to the public. These powers include those under the Public Order Act 1986 (the “1986 Act”) which provides the police with powers to manage public processions and assemblies, including protests. Sections 12 and 14 of the 1986 Act (as amended by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022) allow the police to impose any type of condition on a public procession or public assembly necessary to prevent: significant impact on persons or serious disruption to the activities of an organisation by noise; serious disorder; serious damage to property; serious disruption to the life of the community; or if the purpose of the persons organising the protest is the intimidation of others with a view to compelling them not to do an act they have a right to do, or to do an act they have a right not to do.</p>

<p>The Public Order Bill builds on the public order measures in Part 3 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 which, amongst other things, updates the powers in the 1986 Act enabling the police to impose conditions on a protest, provides for a statutory offence of intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance and increases the maximum penalty for the offence of wilful obstruction of a highway.</p>

<p>The government had originally sought to include the majority of the measures provided for in the Public Order Bill in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, but the government’s amendments to that Bill were blocked by the House of Lords.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Why are you reintroducing these measures?</h3>

<p>These are sensible and proportionate measures designed to allow the police to better balance the rights of protestors and the public. Recent actions by protest groups such as Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain have shown that the government needs to act in preventing serious disruption.</p>

<p>Additionally, one of the main criticisms Peers made during the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill was that these measures were not debated in the House of Commons. By introducing a new bill, we are giving the elected House an opportunity to scrutinise and vote on the government’s proposals.</p>

<h3>Will these measures ban protests?</h3>

<p>No, these measures will not ban protests. These measures will only prevent a small minority of individuals from causing serious disruption to the daily lives of the public.</p>

<h3>Is there public support for these measures?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. A YouGov poll published in March found that close to two thirds (63%) of the public support making ‘locking on’ a criminal offence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. A more recent survey also found that 53% of those asked supported tougher measures for activists blocking roads, transport and other infrastructure<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Are these measures compliant with human rights?</h3>

<p>Yes. Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights set out that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, assembly and association.</p>

<p>However, these rights are not absolute and must be balanced with the rights and freedoms of others. These new measures will balance the rights of protesters with the rights of others to go about their business unhindered. The measures will achieve this by enabling the police to better manage highly disruptive protests.</p>

<p>As with existing public order powers, the police will need to act compatibly with the human rights of protesters when using them.</p>

<h3>Won’t extending stop and search powers have a disproportionate impact on people from an ethnic minority background?</h3>

<p>Nobody should be stopped and searched because of their race or ethnicity and safeguards exist to ensure that this does not happen, including statutory codes of practice, use of body worn video to increase accountability and extensive data collection.</p>

<p>Existing safeguards for the stop and search powers that are already in place will apply to stop and search powers provided for in this Bill. We regularly review our safeguards, and we now collect more data on stop and search than ever before – this data is posted online, enabling PCCs and others to hold forces to account for their use. It is also important that communities hold PCCs to account, through the electoral process.</p>

<h3>What’s the threshold for imposing an SDPO?</h3>

<p>A court will be able to impose an SDPO where someone has, on at least two occasions been:</p>

<p>a.	convicted of a protest-related offence;</p>

<p>b.	been found in contempt of court for a protest-related breach of an injunction;</p>

<p>c.	carried out activities related to a protest that resulted or could have resulted in serious disruption;</p>

<p>d.	caused or contributed to other persons committing protest-related offences or breaching protest-related injunction; or</p>

<p>e.	caused or contributed to another person carrying out protest-related activities which resulted or could have resulted in serious disruption.</p>

<p>For all these circumstances, the relevant period for consideration of convictions or behaviour will be five years prior to the day an SDPO is imposed. However, a court will only be able to look back to a person’s 16th birthday. In addition, for all circumstances, two occasions means either two separate days or two separate protests.</p>

<h3>Won’t this mean more junior and inexperienced officers are setting conditions on protests?</h3>

<p>This measure simply makes the power for chief police officers to delegate their authority to set conditions equivalent across all forces in England and Wales. The rank of Commander in the City of London and Metropolitan Police Forces is equivalent to that of Assistant Chief Constable in forces outside London.</p>

<p>This measure will only affect the City of London and Metropolitan Police Forces. We are not changing the rank of officer this power can be delegated to in forces outside London.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<p>Disruptive protests have become increasingly common in recent years. For example, just recently in 2022 Just Stop Oil has already cost the Police £5.9 million in a matter of months.</p>

<p>Between 13 September and 20 November 2021, the police made almost 1,000 arrests relating to the Insulate Britain protests. Police forces have spent in excess of £4 million managing these protests.</p>

<p>During Extinction Rebellion’s protests of April and October 2019, some of London’s busiest areas were brought to a standstill for several days. This had a disproportionate impact on commuters and small businesses, with the policing operation for the two extended protests costing £37 million.</p>

<p>Additionally, the October 2019 protest alone required over 418,000 police officer hours to manage. These officers were pulled away from regular duties such as pursuing serious crime and neighbourhood policing.</p>

<p>HS2 Ltd estimated in October 2021 that sustained protester activity at some sites had cost the project up to £80 million.</p>
