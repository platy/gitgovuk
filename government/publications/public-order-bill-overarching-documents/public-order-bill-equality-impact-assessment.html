<h3>Public Safety Group</h3>

<p>Demonstrating Compliance with the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED)</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Name and outline of policy proposal, guidance, or operational activity</h2>

<p>The Government is introducing the Public Order Bill to strengthen the powers to police non-violent protests. If approved by Parliament, these will enable police to take a more proactive approach to policing highly disruptive protests.</p>

<p>The measures are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Criminalising Lock-Ons</li>
</ul>

<p>This measure will criminalise the act of locking-on where such an act causes or is capable of causing serious disruption. The lack of a specific lock-on offence means that sentences do not always reflect the harm caused and police are limited in their ability to pre-emptively prevent those they believe may lock-on. This offence will change this and allow for consistent and proportionate sentences as well as improving chances of success when prosecuting offenders in court. This offence will carry a maximum penalty of six-monthsâ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Criminalising going equipped to lock-on</li>
</ul>

<p>There will also be an offence of being equipped for locking on, so a person commits an offence if they have an object with them with the intention that it may be used to commit the locking-on offence. This offence will carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Criminalising obstruction of major transport works</li>
</ul>

<p>This measure will create a criminal offence of obstructing or interfering with the construction of major transport works. A major transport work is defined as works authorised by an Act of Parliament or a Development Consent Order. This measure will protect important transport infrastructure projects from small but dedicated groups of protesters such as those who have severely disrupted the construction of HS2. This criminal offence will carry a maximum penalty of a six-month custodial sentence and/or an unlimited fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Criminalising interference with key national infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>This measure will create a new criminal offence of interfering with key national infrastructure. Interference is defined as any act which prevents or significantly delays the operation of the infrastructure to any extent of its intended purposes. Infrastructure in scope includes all motorways, A and B roads, railways, harbours, airports, newspaper printing presses, downstream oil and gas infrastructure, onshore oil and gas exploration and production infrastructure and onshore electricity generation infrastructure. This criminal offence will carry a maximum penalty of a 12-month custodial sentence and/or an unlimited fine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stop and Search Powers</li>
</ul>

<p>This measure will introduce two new stop-and-search powers for police to target those bringing equipment for use in committing any of the following offences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Locking-on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obstruction of major transport works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interference with key national infrastructure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obstruction of a highway involving activity which causes or is capable of causing serious disruption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first of these would be a suspicion-based power, allowing constables to stop and search individuals where they have reasonable suspicion that an individual is carrying equipment made or adapted, or intended to be used in connection with any of the above offences. This would be achieved by widening the existing suspicion-based power in section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Second would be the introduction of a suspicion-less stop and search power for equipment related to these offences, similar to the existing suspicion-less stop and search powers in section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (CJPOA) 1994. These powers will allow the police to search for and seize anything they reasonably believe will be used commit any of the offences listed above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introducing Serious Disruption Prevention Orders (SDPOs)</li>
</ul>

<p>This measure introduces a new preventative court order for police to use to deter individuals from engaging in repeated criminal behaviour or inciting others to do so at protests. SDPOs granted on conviction would apply when an individual aged 18 or over has on at least two occasions in the relevant period:</p>

<p>a. committed a protest-related offence,</p>

<p>b. committed a protest-related breach of an injunction,</p>

<p>c. carried out activities related to a protest that resulted in, or were likely to result in, serious disruption to two or more individuals, or to an organisation, in England and Wales,</p>

<p>d. caused or contributed to the commission by any other person of a protest-related offence or a protest- related breach of an injunction, or</p>

<p>e. caused or contributed to the carrying out by any other person of activities related to a protest that resulted in, or were likely to result in, serious disruption to two or more individuals, or to an organisation, in England and Wales.</p>

<p>Additionally, a court may impose an SDPO on application by police where the court is satisfied that an individual over the age of 18 on at least two occasions in the relevant period has:</p>

<p>a. committed a protest-related offence,</p>

<p>b. committed a protest-related breach of an injunction,</p>

<p>c. carried out activities related to a protest that resulted in, or were likely to result in, serious disruption to two or more individuals, or to an organisation, in England and Wales,</p>

<p>d. caused or contributed to the commission by any other person of a protest-related offence or a protest- related breach of an injunction, or</p>

<p>e. caused or contributed to the carrying out by any other person of activities related to a protest that resulted in, or were likely to result in, serious disruption to two or more individuals, or to an organisation, in England and Wales.</p>

<p>These offences/occasions must have occurred within the relevant period i.e. up to 5-years before the order is imposed, and where the person was aged 16 or over.</p>

<p>The measure gives the court scope to set out any prohibitions and requirements it deems necessary and proportionate. Breaking the terms of an SDPO without reasonable excuse would constitute a criminal offence, carrying a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/or six monthsâ imprisonment. Explicit provision is provided for courts to consider the use of electronic monitoring in ensuring compliance with an order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amending the power for chief police officers to delegate authority to set conditions on an upcoming procession or assembly, or prohibit a trespassory assembly</li>
</ul>

<p>This measure changes the minimum rank of officer that the Commissioners of the City of London and Metropolitan Police Forces can delegate the power to impose conditions on a procession or assembly before it begins or to prohibit a trespassory assembly. This measure alters the minimum rank from Assistant Commissioner to Commander.</p>

<p>Currently, section 15 of the Public Order Act 1986 allows the chief officer of police to delegate their powers to an Assistant Chief Constable, or an Assistant Commissioner for the City of London and Metropolitan Police Forces. If conditions or prohibition are legally challenged, then the officer who imposed the conditions may be required to attend court as a witness to give evidence.</p>

<p>This places a significant burden on senior officers in London where the powers are used the most. Assistant Commissioners in these forces rank higher than Assistant Chief Constables outside of London, and consequently have a number of additional responsibilities. To better spread the burden of setting and accounting for protest conditions, this measure amends section 15, by allowing the Commissioners of the City of London and Metropolitan Police Forces to delegate their power to a senior officer of the rank of Commander or above, which is the equivalent rank to an Assistant Chief Constable outside of London.</p>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>Freedom of assembly and freedom of expression are vital rights that the Government fully supports. The rights of an individual to express their opinion and protest are a cornerstone our democratic society. However, there are instances where individuals at a protest behave in a way that causes unjustifiable disruption or distress to others.</p>

<p>In recent years, protest tactics have led to disproportionate amounts of disruption. The current legislation the police use to manage protests (the Public Order Act 1986) was enacted over three decades ago. The National Police Chiefsâ Council (NPCC) has called on the Government to update this ageing legislation to allow the police to safely and effectively manage the highly disruptive protests we see today. The Home Office has therefore engaged with Police Chiefs and commissioned Her Majestyâs Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services to conduct an inspection into the policing of protests to understand what could be done to ensure that the police can safely manage highly disruptive protests whilst preserving citizensâ freedoms of expression and assembly.</p>

<p>The duty of the police in relation to non-violent protests is to take a balanced and impartial approach towards all those involved in or affected by a protest that is consistent with human rights law and other domestic legislation. This will include ensuring lawful activities e.g. deliveries, normal community life can continue and preventing a breach of the peace.</p>

<p>However, such non-violent protests can cause lengthy and serious disruption. Actions by a small minority of protestors in 2021 have shown that current legislation is unsuitable for current methods of protesting and policing and new legislation should follow suit. This supports the necessity for new amendments to legislation; the police need strengthened powers to tackle non-violent protests, which cause serious disruption and an impact on community life.</p>

<p>In April and October 2019, Extinction Rebellion brought some of Londonâs busiest areas to a standstill for several days. The policing operation for the two extended protests cost Â£37m, more than twice the annual budget of Londonâs violent crime taskforce. Police officers were extracted from other duties in neighbourhood policing and schools, and other investigations were closed down.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Nearly 8,000 Metropolitan Police ofï¬cers were deployed during the October protest, and the Metropolitan Police had to draft in considerable support from other police forces. In April 2019, 1,148 activists were arrested, of whom more than 900 were charged, mostly receiving a conditional discharge. A total of 1,828 protesters were arrested in October 2019. In September 2020, another co-ordinated action by Extinction Rebellion blocked the delivery of newspapers. It drew criticism from across the political spectrum.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following the killing of George Floyd in the US, Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets in British cities â and in some cases met counterdemonstrations by right-wing groups. The debate around Britainâs relationship with the European Union has seen sustained pro- and anti-Brexit demonstrations in London and elsewhere, and there have been anti-lockdown protests in response to the COVID-19 restrictions.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>During September and October 2021, Insulate Britain protests on the M25 have delayed emergency vehicles, caused traffic jams for hundreds of people, and caused medical appointments to be missed. More recently, protestors from the group Just Stop Oil have targeted oil terminals and vandalised fuel stations, causing damage to infrastructure, forcing the closure of terminals and vital deliveries of fuel to be delayed, while putting themselves and those around them in danger.</p>

<p>The Government is proposing several changes in the law which will improve the policeâs ability to proactively manage the most disruptive protests and provide effective criminal justice outcomes that reflect the seriousness of offences committed by protesters.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The quantitative data provided by the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice is collected at the offence group level only (i.e., âPublic Order Offenceâ). This includes many public order offences which are unaffected by the measures in the Public Order Bill such as riot, violent disorder, and affray among others. Therefore, their application to the measures in the Bill is limited.</p>

<p>HMICFRSâ inspection report into the policing of protests provides analysis of arrest and sentencing data for more specific offences relevant to the measures. However, they do not provide a breakdown by protected characteristics.</p>

<h3>Statistical Evidence</h3>

<p>The Home Office publishes an annual statistical bulletin, Police Powers and Procedures, which includes detailed figures on stop and search. The most recent publication is here and contains data for 2020/2021:</p>

<p>We have also considered data published by the Ministry of Justice on ethnicity and the Criminal Justice System. The most recent publication is here and contains data for 2020:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3A. </span> Consideration of limb 1 of the duty: Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act.</h2>

<h3>Age</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of age.</p>

<p>Indirect - In relation to stop and search, the current available data does suggest a disparity in the use of the current stop and search powers against young people.</p>

<p>Data from Police Powers and Procedures statistics, for England and Wales overall in 2020/21 show that over half (54%) of all stop and search of people were on those aged 24 or under, with 17% of the total under 18. For section 60 searches only, these numbers increased to 63% under 24, and 21% under 18.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>This evidence relates to the use of stop and search by police to tackle serious violence and drug offences. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of stop and search powers in relation to the public order offences in scope of this Bill will have a disproportionate impact on people on the grounds of age, if the use of these powers is fair and based on evidence and intelligence and not based on the protected characteristics of those attending a particular protest.</p>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of disability.</p>

<p>Indirect - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of disability. If any event, we consider that the measures are a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of preventing crime and public disorder and protecting the rights of others.</p>

<h3>Gender Reassignment</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of gender reassignment.</p>

<p>Indirect - Certain protests, depending on the cause they represent, may be represented by a majority of people who have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. As with the use of all public order powers, we expect the police to apply the measures in this Bill in a fair and proportionate manner that carefully considers individualsâ freedoms of religion, expression and assembly under the Human Rights Act 1998, as well as the protected characteristics of anyone at the protest whilst complying with the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<h3>Marriage and Civil Partnership</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of marriage and civil partnership.</p>

<p>Indirect - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of marriage and civil partnership.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and Maternity</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity.</p>

<p>Indirect - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of race.</p>

<p>Indirect - Protests relating to racial equality may consist of a majority of persons from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds. In relation to stop and search, the current available data that does suggest a disparity in the use of the current stop and search powers against individuals from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, particularly Black individuals and young men.</p>

<p>In 2020/21, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people were 3.5 times more likely to be stopped and searched than White people.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> For Black people specifically, this was 7 times more likely, and Black people were also 14 times more likely than White people to be searched under suspicion-less stop and search powers granted under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Furthermore, the most recent statistics on Ethnicity and the Criminal Justice System showed that the average custodial sentence length (indictable offences) for White people (19.6 months) was much lower than the same statistics for Black people (26.8 months), Asian people (28.6 months), people from a mixed background (24.4 months) and people from a Chinese or other background (24.4 months).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>This evidence relates to the use of stop and search by police to tackle serious violence and drug offences. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of stop and search powers in relation to the public order offences in scope of this Bill will have a disproportionate impact on people on the grounds of race if the use of these powers is fair and based on evidence and intelligence and not based on the protected characteristics of those attending a particular protest.</p>

<p>In particular, the police should use these new stop and search powers to prevent individuals committing public order offences and causing serious disruption. Nobody should be stopped and searched because of their race or ethnicity and safeguards exist to ensure that this does not happen, including PACE codes of practice, use of body worn video and extensive data collection. We encourage forces to scrutinise and review how they use their powers to ensure they remain focused, legitimate, proportionate, and necessary. We will also be updating PACE Code A to reflect these new measures, ensuring police have clear guidance and codes of practice in the exercise of these new powers.</p>

<h3>Religion or belief</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of religion or belief.</p>

<p>Indirect â Certain protests, depending on the cause they represent, may be represented by a majority of people who share the same religion or belief. As with the use of all public order powers, we expect the police to apply the measures in this Bill in a fair and proportionate manner that carefully considers the individualâs freedoms of religion, expression and assembly under the Human Rights Act 1998, as well as the protected characteristics of anyone at the protest. The police are required to comply with the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>In relation to SDPOs, there is specific provision that provides that requirements or prohibitions which are imposed on a person by such an order must, so far as practicable, be such as to avoid any conflict with the personâs religious beliefs.</p>

<h3>Sex</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of sex.</p>

<p>Indirect - Certain protests, depending on the cause they represent, may be represented by a majority of people who share the same sex. As with the use of all public order powers, we expect the police to apply the measures in this Bill in a fair and proportionate manner that carefully considers the individualâs freedoms of religion, expression and assembly under the Human Rights Act 1998, as well as the protected characteristics of anyone at the protest. The police are required to comply with the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>Additionally, in relation to stop and search, the current available data suggests a disparity in the use of stop and search powers against males.</p>

<p>Data from Police Powers and Procedures statistics show that, in the year ending March 2021, 70% of stop and searches carried out were on males aged between 15 and 34, whilst this cohort comprises 13% of the overall population. In contrast, females aged between 15 and 34 accounted for 7% of stop and search, despite accounting for 12% of the overall population.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>This evidence relates to the use of stop and search by police to tackle serious violence and drug offences. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of stop and search powers in relation to the public order offences in scope of this Bill will have a disproportionate impact on people on the grounds of sex if the use of these powers is fair and based on evidence and intelligence and not based on the protected characteristics of those attending a particular protest.</p>

<h3>Sexual Orientation</h3>

<p>Direct - We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that any of these measures will be directly discriminatory on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Indirect - Certain protests, depending on the cause they represent, may be represented by a majority of people who share the same sexual orientation. As with the use of all public order powers, we expect the police to apply the measures in this Bill in a fair and proportionate manner that carefully considers the individualâs freedoms of religion, expression and assembly under the Human Rights Act 1998, as well as the protected characteristics of anyone at the protest. The police are required to comply with the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3B. </span> Consideration of limb 2: Advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it.</h2>

<p>We have assessed the way in which police manage protests and how it does have a bearing on equality of opportunity. The measures in the Bill do not of themselves have a negative impact. The changes to legislation potentially affect all individuals in the UK â regardless of their protected characteristics. Protected characteristics need to be considered by police when making use of the powers and the way each protest is handled will be unique to its circumstances given the need for the police to comply with the Equality Act 2010. The police will then adapt accordingly.</p>

<p>The police make effective use of national guidance and structures to ensure a consistent approach across the country in policing protests. Forces often work collaboratively to manage protests, with strong relationships between protest-intelligence teams and mutual-aid agreements between forces enable the effective transfer of specialist teams and equipment to respond to protests across the country. Forces are also supported in their response to large-scale protests by the National Police Coordination Centre (NPoCC). The NPCC has also worked closely with the College of Policing to update operational advice for forces responding to protests, whilst the College of Policingâs Authorised Professional Practice is regularly updated to provided guidance to officers on the effective use of their powers in respond to protests.</p>

<p>Operationally police should make sure they treat all individuals at the protests the same way, unless they have other reasons to do so (e.g., if a protestor is committing a crime). Both government and the police should consult training and education material (such as the Authorised Professional Practice for the use of powers such as Stop and Search, or external guidance from organisations such as Netpol) to ensure powers are used effectively. We will also be updating PACE Code A to reflect these new measures, ensuring police have clear guidance and codes of practice in the exercise of these new powers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3C. </span> Consideration of limb 3: Foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic</h2>

<p>The measures will help make sure that the police have the necessary powers to effectively manage protests. This legislation will provide clear distinctions of what both the police and protestors can and cannot do, and the police will be expected to continue to maintain open communication with protestors throughout their protests.</p>

<p>We regularly consult the police on what they are doing operationally to maintain relationships between themselves and protesters. What the police actively do will also help to foster relationships with those with protected characteristics. Police Liaison Teams (PLT) have been used by the police to interact with protesters, the HMICFRS report has found that PLTs had generally developed good relationships across a network of protest groups.</p>

<p>We have also considered and taken into account that these measures will be interpreted and thought of differently by different groups and those with different characteristics at different points in time. For example, in policing the same protest some groups will criticise the police for being too heavy handed while others will say they were not sufficiently robust. They may also draw comparisons between the policing of different protests.</p>

<p>We have also considered that the police may need to use the new legislation when those with particular protected characteristics are at odds with others who have different protected characteristics. HMICFRSâ report found that forces are sometimes caught between two opposing viewpoints. One officer noted that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Black Lives Matter was a challenge for the force. Similar challenges were faced last year when the Muslim community protested outside schools about what they saw as inappropriate sexual health lessons. The LGBT community opposed this. There were no easy answers. If there was an easy position, there wouldnât be a protest. All we can do is uphold the values and police impartially. This is who we are and what we do and why. We are not chosen for our views but to protect others. There is no perfect solution, [if] they understand what we are doing and why â thatâs the best we can hope for.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The police and Government are aware of the difficulties of managing all protests even-handedly irrespective of the cause they seek to promote. The police continuously make efforts to learn from the management of past protests and listen and learn from criticism from third parties to ensure that their use of powers is fair and proportionate, regardless of the type of protest being managed.</p>

<p>On 17 March 2022, the Government published its âInclusive Britainâ report, the recommendations of which aim to increase public confidence and trust in the police, including the use of their stop and search powers. The Home Office, with policing partners including Police and Crime Commissioners, will develop by summer 2023 a new, national framework for how the use of police powers - including stop and search and use of force - are scrutinised at a local level. This framework will ensure that local scrutiny panels are independently led, reflect the diversity of the areas they represent and give police officers the confidence to use their powers with the backing of local communities. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Age</h3>

<p>We have not identified any specific ways in which the measures in this Bill can help foster good relations between people on the grounds of age.</p>

<p>Recent surveys have highlighted that older people are generally more supportive of the Governmentâs measures to tackle protests. A YouGov survey conducted in February 2022, concluded that 80% of over-65s supported the proposed locking-on offence, while only 32% of those aged 18-24 supported such an offence.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<p>Evidence also suggests younger people may lack confidence that the police are using stop and search fairly. A study examining children stopped and searched in the Metropolitan Police force area, found that the children surveyed, and their parents, felt they were treated with more suspicion than adults and judged on the way they dress.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>Forces are required, under statutory guidance, to monitor the community impact of stop and search via their local scrutiny groups, so should be considering the potential for decreased trust and taking steps to mitigate it. For example, recent steps towards increased use of body worn video during stop and searchesâwhich was less common when much of the research cited above was carried out âwill help forces and local scrutiny groups monitor stop and search more effectively.</p>

<p>Protests by their very nature can raise divisive and challenging issues faced by our society, and how the policeâs response to protests will be received will vary across age groups, as the YouGov poll shows. However, it is important that police have the powers necessary to balance the rights of individuals to engage in protest with the need to protect the public from serious disruption, and the measures in this Bill will better help the police maintain that balance.</p>

<h3>Disability</h3>

<p>We have not identified any specific ways in which the measures in this Bill can help foster good relations between people on the grounds of disability.</p>

<h3>Gender Reassignment</h3>

<p>We have not identified any specific ways in which the measures in this Bill can help foster good relations between people on the grounds of gender reassignment.</p>

<h3>Marriage and Civil Partnership</h3>

<p>We have not identified any specific ways in which the measures in this Bill can help foster good relations between people on the grounds of marriage and civil partnership.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and Maternity</h3>

<p>We have not identified any specific ways in which the measures in this Bill can help foster good relations between people on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p>In relation to the new stop and search measures, there is evidence which suggests that individuals from a Black and Minority Ethnic background are less likely to have confidence in the policeâs use of stop and search, and to view the police negatively as a result. Given the potentially negative impact on trust in the police that an increase in stop and search might have, this would risk having a negative effect on a part of the community where trust and confidence levels are relatively low.</p>

<p>According to HMICFRS 2017 PEEL inspections, disparity rates continue âto threaten trust and confidence in the policeâ, with improvements required to the operation of stop and search if the tactic was not to âcontinue to undermine police legitimacyâ.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> They also noted concerns that forces could not always adequately explain disproportionality in their use of stop and search.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<p>HMICFRSâ 2021 Spotlight report on stop and search found that, while officer training on stop and search had improved, there were still many gaps in officersâ skills and knowledge.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup></p>

<p>Since trust in the police and co-operation with them is often necessary for effective community policing, such changes may create broader issues. Whilst there is evidence that there is a desire across all communities for a visible police presence to deter crime, police must ensure they are treating individuals, regardless of their race or community background fairly, particularly when exercising their stop and search powers.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<p>We regularly review our safeguards and we now collect more data on stop and search than ever before â this data is posted online, enabling PCCs and others to hold forces to account for their use. It is critical that we maintain public confidence in policing and as we set out in the Inclusive Britain report, published on 17 March 2022, we will be looking carefully at strengthening the system of local community scrutiny and the value of body-worn video, because transparency is vital. Furthermore, the police will need to justify and explain any disproportionate impact on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities when using these powers.</p>

<p>The College of Policing has recently updated its stop and search guidance to ensure fair and proportionate use. This updated guidance â available to all forces â was published in July 2020 and provides best practice examples for forces to use on community engagement and scrutiny.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Summary of foreseeable impacts of policy proposal on people who share protected characteristics</h2>

<h3>Age</h3>

<p>Negative Impact - The extension of stop and search measures may have a disproportionate impact on age and may damage trust in the police from younger people who are less likely to think the police use stop and search powers fairly.</p>

<p>Action to address negative impact - Regarding stop and search powers, the police should use these powers to lawfully prevent serious disruption and protect communities. Nobody should be stopped and searched just because of their age, and safeguards exist to ensure that this does not happen, including PACE codes of practice, use of body worn video and extensive data collection. PACE Code A will be updated following the passage of the Bill to reflect these new stop and search provisions, to ensure that their use is covered by the appropriate statutory guidance. Data will be collected on the use of these powers and published in due course in the Home Officeâs annual statistical bulletin Police Powers and Procedures.</p>

<h3>Disability</h3>

<p>We have not identified any foreseeable positive or negative impacts of these measures on people on the grounds of disability.</p>

<h3>Gender Reassignment</h3>

<p>We have not identified any foreseeable positive or negative impacts of these measures on people who have undergone gender reassignment.</p>

<h3>Marriage and Civil Partnership</h3>

<p>We have not identified any foreseeable positive or negative impacts of these measures on people who are married or in a civil partnership.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and Maternity</h3>

<p>We have not identified any foreseeable positive or negative impacts of these measures on people who are pregnant or recently had children.</p>

<h3>Race</h3>

<p>Negative Impact â These measures may have an indirect impact on people from different racial backgrounds, as the extension of stop and search powers and the increase in the number of criminal offences may disproportionally impact Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people.</p>

<p>Actions to address negative impact â Forces are required under the Human Rights Act 1998 not to act incompatibly with the freedoms enshrined under that Act, and we will continue to work with the police to ensure they use these new powers in a fair and proportionate manner that does not discriminate against people because of their race.</p>

<p>Regarding stop and search powers, the police should use these powers to lawfully prevent serious disruption and protect communities. Nobody should be stopped and searched because of their race or ethnicity and safeguards exist to ensure that this does not happen, including PACE codes of practice, use of body worn video and extensive data collection.

Data will be collected on the use of these powers and published in due course in the Home Officeâs annual statistical bulletin Police Powers and Procedures. Work is ongoing to develop a minimum standard of scrutiny framework for the policeâs overall use of stop and search powers, with the intention of improving opportunities for the police to explain their use of powers to communities and improve public trust in the process.</p>

<h3>Religion or belief</h3>

<p>Negative Impact â Certain protests may be attended by a majority of people who share the same religion or belief. Any use of these powers at such protests could fuel the belief that the police are using their powers in a discriminatory way against people of a certain religion or belief.</p>

<p>Actions to address negative impact - Forces are required under the Human Rights Act 1998 not to act incompatibly with the freedoms enshrined under that Act, and we will continue to work with the police to ensure they use these new powers in a fair and proportionate manner that does not discriminate against people because of their religion or belief.</p>

<h3>Sex</h3>

<p>Negative Impact â Certain protests may be attended by a majority of people who share the same sex. Any use of these powers at such protests could fuel the belief that the police are using their powers in a discriminatory way against people of the same sex. Additionally, the extension of stop and search measures may have a disproportionate impact on males.</p>

<p>Actions to address negative impact - Forces are required under the Human Rights Act 1998 not to act incompatibly with the freedoms enshrined under that Act. They are also required to comply with the Equality Act 2010. We will continue to work with the police to ensure they use these new powers in a fair and proportionate manner that does not discriminate against people because of their sex.</p>

We will continue to work with the police to ensure they use these new powers in a fair and proportionate manner that does not discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> In light of the overall policy objective, are there any ways to avoid or mitigate any of the negative impacts that you have identified above?</h2>

<p>We have discussed these measures with law enforcement stakeholders and believe they will have no direct impact on any protected characteristics. Although, as noted in Sections 3A and 3C, there is a possibility that there may be a disproportionate indirect impact on groups sharing protected characteristics, reflecting wider disproportionate impact on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic individuals or those with characteristics reflecting the make-up of cause specific protests. As a result, we will work to put measures in place to mitigate any indirect impacts the measures in this Bill will have.</p>

<p>For the measure relating to stop and search, there is already a number of legislative safeguards in place, including statutory codes of practice which govern a search, body worn video to hold officers and the public account and external scrutiny processes.</p>

<p>Use of stop and search is covered by Code A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). Code A will be updated following the passage of the Bill to reflect these new stop and search provisions, to ensure that their use is covered by the appropriate statutory guidance.</p>

<p>The Home Office also collects more data on stop and search than ever before â including the race, age and gender of the person searched, what they were searched for, and how often objects were found for each force. Once available, disproportionality within stop and search can be monitored at a national-level and officials will continue to review whether any mitigations or safeguards are required as a result. We are also collecting more detailed data from April 2021 â which we will continue to review to identify whether further mitigations or safeguards on our policy are requiredâthis data should be published in October 2022. This data is published online annually, allowing local scrutiny groups, PCCs and others to hold forces to account, and it is discussed with relevant NPCC leads and forces to understand why disparities may arise. We will be looking into whether this data can help identify any discrimination in regard to our new measure of stop and search for lock-on equipment.</p>

<p>HMICFRS also look at force level disparity and usage data, including the rates at which items are found on different racial groups, as part of force assessments. HMICFRS also noted the importance of considering âfair applicationâ â that is, whether people searched under each authorisation match the information on which that authorisation is based (e.g., certain age, gender or race of perpetrators) when looking at the disproportionality rate in s60 searches.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>Extensive operational guidance also already exists for forces to follow for best practice safeguards on stop and search.</p>

<p>We will continue to work closely with the police to ensure that the risk of indirect discrimination is considered at all stages of police training and that best practice is shared between forces to ensure a consistent approach to the policing of protests across England and Wales.</p>

<p>We will also work with Home Office analysts and statisticians to put in place a mechanism for collecting data relating to use of these powers to improve our understanding of the impact they have on those with protected characteristics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Review date</h2>

<p>We will continually assess the impact on equalities duties as the position progresses and we will review the impacts routinely once any new amendments have been introduced.</p>

<p>We will also work with Home Office analysts and statisticians to determine whether there is a mechanism to collate, monitor and evaluate any new data relating to the implementation of these legislative amendments.</p>

<p>The measures in the Public Order Act will be subject to the usual post-legislative review five years after Royal Assent.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Declaration</h2>

<p>I have read the available evidence and I am satisfied that this demonstrates compliance, where relevant, with section 149 of the Equality Act and that due regard has been made to the need to: eliminate unlawful discrimination; advance equality of opportunity; and foster good relations.</p>
