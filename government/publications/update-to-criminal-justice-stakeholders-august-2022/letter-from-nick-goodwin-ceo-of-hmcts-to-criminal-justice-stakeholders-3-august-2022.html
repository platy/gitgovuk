<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>CEO introduction and progress update from the criminal courts</h2>

<p>Dear colleague,</p>

<p>For those of you I’ve not yet met, I’d like to formally introduce myself as the Chief Executive of HM Courts and Tribunals (HMCTS), a position which I’m incredibly proud to hold. Having previously served as Public Guardian and before that, Director for Access to Justice Policy at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the world of justice is one with which I’m very familiar.</p>

<p>It’s been a whirlwind few months since I joined the organisation in March this year, but having now had a few months to get my feet under the table, it felt the right time to write and update you on the current position in our criminal courts.</p>

<p>I’m acutely aware of the fact that everything I will cover in this update – the successes we’ve achieved and the challenges we’re working to overcome – is done in partnership with others across the criminal justice system at the heart of so much of it. So, I wanted to say, up front, thank you for all you do – your support, advice, insight and dedication to improving our criminal courts are essential.</p>

<p>I’ve included an update as annexes to this letter, which sets out the latest position in our Crown and magistrates’ courts in more detail. But I wanted to provide a few headlines up front on where we’re currently up to on our recovery journey as we seek to redress the impacts of the pandemic on our criminal courts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the magistrates’ courts, the criminal caseload has fallen from 445,000 in July 2020 to 352,200 in May 2022 – a reduction of over 20%.</li>
  <li>The outstanding caseload in the Crown Court has reduced from a high of around 60,600 cases in June 2021 to around 58,300 cases at the end of May 2022. For the second year running we have no limits on sitting days in 2022-23.</li>
  <li>We now have over 490 Crown courtrooms available for use, which is comparable to pre-pandemic levels.</li>
  <li>30 Nightingale courtrooms have been extended beyond March 2022 in the places where they are most needed. Both ‘super courtrooms’ in Manchester and Loughborough are now open, allowing us to handle an extra 500 cases a year in England and Wales.</li>
  <li>The special measure enabling pre-recorded cross examination (section 28) is being extended for intimidated complainants in the Crown Court. It’s now available in 58 courts and we’ll roll it out nationwide as fast as is practically possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Progress is being delivered by a range of measures and initiatives, outlined in the attached annexes. This activity is a mix of that being delivered through our £1.3bn reform programme, and other creative, progressive steps we are taking as part of our day-to-day operational delivery.</p>

<p>We cannot ignore that there is still a long way to go, and there are obvious immediate challenges to work through together. As I write this letter, for example, the criminal bar is continuing to take action in the Crown Court as part of its dispute with the government. Court staff continue to work hard to manage the impacts of this, and listing officers are working closely with resident judges to ensure as many cases as possible can be heard.</p>

<p>Our frontline staff continue to ably respond to a range of other emerging operational issues, such as protestors in court. As always, their professionalism, along with the support of our partners, is mitigating the impact wherever possible.</p>

<p>Those who work in our courts – not just HMCTS staff but all professional court users – are a constant reminder to me that people are at the heart of everything we do. Behind every case file is a person. And our people – their skills, knowledge and compassion – are our biggest asset.</p>

<p>As we emerge from the pandemic, the lessons we have learned in rapid time have given us a renewed steeliness and proven beyond doubt that the vision of the reform programme is not just compelling, it is business critical. All of this means that our resilience and readiness for whatever challenges will inevitably come our way in the future is stronger than ever.</p>

<p>I hope you find the attached update helpful and would be grateful if you could share it amongst your colleagues and members, so they remain informed about the latest position in the criminal courts.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Nick Goodwin</p>

<p>Chief Executive, HMCTS</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Annex A: Progressing plans to deal with outstanding cases</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Recovery progress in the criminal courts</h3>

<p>The impact of the pandemic on the criminal courts was profound. Colleagues across HMCTS, and the criminal justice system, have worked tirelessly to keep justice running under extraordinarily difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>We were the first comparable jurisdiction in the world to restart jury trials, and our rapid and widespread introduction of video and audio technology ensured justice could continue, alongside reconfiguring our estate where possible and using additional external spaces.</p>

<p>However, we have been left with high numbers of outstanding cases in both the Crown and magistrates’ courts, and we know that many victims feel they have to wait much too long for justice to be served.</p>

<p>We continue to do everything we can in the criminal courts to reduce the impacts of COVID-19, working in partnership with colleagues from our criminal justice partner agencies. In recent months we have continued to pull every lever available to us to help tackle the open caseload in our criminal courts.</p>

<p>Performance updates for the criminal courts are regularly made available to the public via monthly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmcts-management-information">HMCTS management information,</a> official <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/criminal-court-statistics-quarterly-january-to-march-2022">criminal court statistics</a> published by the MOJ each quarter, and as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://criminal-justice-delivery-data-dashboards.justice.gov.uk/" rel="external">Criminal Justice System Delivery Data Dashboard</a> which brings together data from partners across the justice system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>The magistrates’ court</h3>

<p>The judiciary and HMCTS published a 5-point plan for recovery in April 2021 to safely restore court activity and reduce waiting times to pre-pandemic levels at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>In the magistrates’ court, the criminal caseload has fallen from 445,000 in July 2020 to 352,200 in May 2022 – a reduction of over 20%. This is now close to pre-pandemic levels, and has been achieved through a range of measures including sitting additional courts on Saturdays (with over 1081 additional days between August 2020 and the end of September 2021) and the judiciary listing cases flexibly so that we use our court estate as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Timeliness figures in the magistrates’ court continues to improve. A criminal case is now disposed in 32 weeks on average, three weeks faster than April 2021 (35 weeks).</p>

<p>Timeliness from first listing to completion is 3.81 weeks, an improvement from 7 weeks in November 2020, but still higher than the pre-covid baseline of 2.68 weeks. And time from charge to completion was 10.42 weeks, down from 14.7 weeks in November 2022 but still higher than the pre-covid baseline of 8.4 weeks.</p>

<p>A year ago, trial delay was felt to be a significant risk, but almost all regions now report no significant delay in listing trials following a concerted effort to get through these cases (known as ‘trial blitzes’) in nearly all regions.</p>

<p>The Single Justice Procedure (SJP) is allowing prosecutors to deal with cases involving adult defendants accused of lesser offences that cannot result in a prison sentence, such as speeding, driving without insurance, TV license evasion and train fare evasion. A magistrate conducts SJP, alongside a legal adviser, dealing with the case at any time, rather than on a specific date. There’s no prosecutor or defendant present. It saves time, resource and inconvenience for all involved, while also delivering justice.</p>

<p>There were over 637,000 cases completed by SJP in 2021. Of those summary-only offences, over 486,000 were motoring offences and over 150,000 were non-motoring offences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>The Crown Court</h3>

<p>Despite the challenges we have faced in the criminal justice system, colleagues and justice partners in criminal courts have succeeded in keeping justice moving in the face of the unprecedented pandemic. As a result, the outstanding caseload in the Crown Court has reduced from around 60,600 cases in June 2021 to around 58,300 cases at the end of May 2022.</p>

<p>Working with the judiciary and criminal justice partners, we will build on this progress through a range of measures and initiatives designed to maximise available judicial capacity and address the issues that inhibit system-wide efficiency and productivity.</p>

<p>Over the next 3 financial years, the MOJ is investing an extra £477 million for the criminal justice system to help improve waiting times for victims of crime and reduce the Crown Court backlog to an estimated 53,000 cases by March 2025.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Physical capacity</h3>

<p>Thirty Nightingale courtrooms – 22 of which are delivering Crown Court work – have been extended beyond the end of March 2022. These are giving us essential additional capacity beyond the parameters of our traditional estate and are playing a vital part in securing speedier access to justice for all court users. They provide an additional capacity for the Crown Court either directly or by hosting other work which makes space for jury trials in the existing estate.</p>

<p>Our Nightingales, along with more than 60 Crown courtrooms that we have now reopened following unavailability during the pandemic, means around 500 Crown courtrooms are now available for hearings and trials, which is higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>We’ve also now opened both of our ‘super courtrooms’ in Manchester and Loughborough, which are allowing us to handle an extra 500 cases a year in England and Wales.&nbsp; Each ‘super courtroom’ creates the space needed to hear trials and free up capacity elsewhere, allowing up to an extra 250 cases a year to be heard across England and Wales.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Remote technology and judicial capacity</h3>

<p>By rapidly rolling out of video technology, it means that over 70% of all courtrooms – including over 90% of Crown courtrooms – are able to hold remote hearings, with up to 20,000 cases being heard virtually each week at the height of the pandemic. While some hearings can often be carried out with many of the participants attending remotely – and it is always a judge or magistrate who decides whether hearings should be in-person, by video or audio – trials and bail cases usually require physical attendance at court.</p>

<p>For the second year in a row, there will be no limit on sitting days in the Crown Court. This means that the courts will continue working at full capacity. Additionally, the MOJ is expanding our plans for judicial recruitment to secure enough capacity to sit at the required levels in 2022/2023 and beyond. This aims to recruit around 1,100 new judges across all jurisdictions in 2022, to enable us to sit at the maximum possible level over the coming years.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the department has authorised certain District Judges from the magistrates’ court to sit in the Crown Court, which is estimated to add up to 1,400 sitting days this year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Working flexibly across regions</h3>

<p>Liverpool Crown Court is supporting London and the south-eastern circuit by hearing a number of its appeals during July and August. As part of this arrangement, 81 appeals have been transferred from London to Liverpool, and our south-east region has been allocated 30 slots to hear appeals in the week beginning 1 August, making use of remote video link facilities as required.</p>

<p>We have found cases to fill all available slots and made arrangements to notify and agree arrangements with parties. We are currently developing plans to repeat this initiative later in the year.</p>

<p>We have also agreed a protocol to manage the transfer of suitable cases from the south-eastern circuit to the south-west circuit. Two courtrooms at Winchester Crown Court have been allocated to hear cases selected from across the south-eastern circuit for the remainder of the current financial year, and 13 cases have already transferred.</p>

<p>Additional support will be provided under this scheme if, and when, more capacity becomes available within the south-west circuit.</p>

<p>Since 10 June, we have also been piloting a remote sentencing initiative at Swansea Crown Court, where a courtroom is made available each week to list committal for sentences cases from Snaresbrook Crown Court.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Policy updates</h3>

<p>Wider policy changes have also been introduced to reduce the impact on the Crown Court. For example, magistrates’ sentencing powers have been increased from 6 to 12 months for a single triable either way offence to allow more cases to be heard in the magistrates’ court. The MoJ expects this introduction to free up around 1,700 extra days of Crown Court time each year.</p>

<p>Additionally, the department passed the Judicial Review and Courts Act earlier this year, under which provision have been made to give the Crown Court more flexibility to return cases to the magistrates, which aims to reduce demand in the Crown Court.</p>

<p>We’re also introducing the special measure that enables pre-recorded cross examination (section 28) further and are currently extending it for intimidated witnesses in the Crown Court. It’s now available in 58 Crown Courts and we will roll it out nationwide as fast as is practically possible. It allows complainants of sexual offences and modern slavery cases to have their cross-examination video-recorded and played later during the live trial. This is in addition to the measure being available to vulnerable witnesses, such as children or those who have a physical or mental impairment, at all Crown courts in England and Wales since November 2020.</p>

<p>Television cameras are now allowed to broadcast sentencing remarks from Crown Courts in England and Wales for the first time, using technology and modern ways of working to increase the openness of justice for people up and down the country. Sentencing remarks of High Court and Senior Circuit judges in some of the most high-profile courts across the country, including the Old Bailey, means the public will be able to hear judges explain the reasons behind their sentences for the most serious offences.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Annex B: Reform programme progress</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Progress to date</h3>

<p>The HMCTS reform programme was launched in 2016 and is investing over £1.3bn to modernise and improve justice services. It’s the most ambitious programme of its kind in the world. ​</p>

<p>Since its launch, we have been modernising our services, providing new, user-friendly digital services and improving efficiency at the same time. The original vision for reform - to modernise and upgrade our justice system so that it works even better for everyone - remains true. But we must recognise that the world has changed since 2016 – and rapidly so – as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>To simply be able to keep our courts operating, we have had to adapt quickly and make immediate changes to our ways of working and our technology. It is now even clearer that we need to finish our programme of reform so we can recover from the impacts of the pandemic, ensure our future resilience and provide a platform for future development to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.</p>

<p>The vision of the reform programme is not just compelling, it is business critical. That work was recognised as vital before the pandemic and the response to the pandemic galvanised that idea.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Common Platform</h3>

<p>Common Platform is a fundamental part of the reform programme. It is essential if we are to successfully increase the efficiency of the criminal justice system overall and bring people speedier access to justice. It’s replacing whole networks of outdated systems that are no longer fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Its benefits include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The judiciary, legal professionals, the Crown Prosecution Service and court staff will be able to securely access the most up-to date case information available.</li>
  <li>In particular, defence are able to ‘self-serve’ case materials, removing the need to request them.</li>
  <li>Documents will be able to be submitted to court digitally and enable&nbsp;lawyers to represent clients remotely where appropriate,&nbsp;saving time, effort and cost.</li>
  <li>Various milestones in a case (such as notices, orders and warrants), will be shared automatically with the relevant organisations.</li>
  <li>Common Platform will enable a more comprehensive collection of Crime essential data as a single national source of information from both magistrates’ and Crown Court jurisdictions. This will support us in understanding the needs of court users and continually improving our services.</li>
  <li>Some business processes will be automated where appropriate, reducing administrative effort and avoiding errors and delays.</li>
  <li>As it’s an in-house system, we will be able to easily make changes and improvements in future, keeping the system up-to-date with new technologies.</li>
  <li>These efficiencies will reduce the cost of the courts to the taxpayer.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the pause in rollout which began last summer due to issues with slowness and stability of Common Platform, the HMCTS crime programme worked around the clock to deliver a suite of improvements and upgrades.</p>

<p>This enabled us to implement Common Platform in criminal courts in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, during March and April 2022. Performance at these courts was reviewed and have given us the reassurance we needed to move to the next phase of rollout which will introduce Common Platform to 29 more criminal court sites over July and August.</p>

<p>System performance, stability and speed have significantly improved as a result of the improvements, and this has been confirmed by independent user feedback. Performance data gives us full confidence that the system is successfully managing the increased numbers of users and cases.</p>

<p>Common Platform is currently live in 127 courts, equating to 56% of all criminal courts, and has managed over 250,000 criminal cases since implementation began.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Video hearings service</h3>

<p>This is HMCTS’ bespoke video hearings solution. Courts will gradually transition away from CVP and Microsoft Teams as the service is introduced.</p>

<p>The service is being used in a number of tribunal chambers including Tax and Property, and planning is currently underway for the service to be used in criminal courts later in 2022. When introduced, it&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;available&nbsp;for&nbsp;all&nbsp;suitable&nbsp;cases and hearing types subject to judicial discretion.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Property</h3>

<p>On the physical estate, we’re working in partnership with the City of London Corporation to provide a new purpose-built court on Fleet Street, expected to be operational in 2026.</p>

<p>The new combined court centre will deliver a modern, multi-purpose court with a focus on economic crime. It will replace the ageing county and magistrates’ courts in the City of London and provide 2 additional county court rooms and 8 additional crown court rooms.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Court and tribunal hearings service</h3>

<p>Formerly known as the Publications and Information service, it’s where we publish list information. Starting with civil and family jurisdictions, planning is underway for the use of this service in the criminal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Single Justice Procedure public list has been available to view on the service since 22 June 2022.</p>
