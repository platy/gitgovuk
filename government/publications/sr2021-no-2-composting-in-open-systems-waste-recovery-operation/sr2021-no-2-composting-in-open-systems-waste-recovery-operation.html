<p>‘capacity’ means the potential capacity and not historical or actual production levels or throughput. Biological treatment of waste usually takes place over more than one day, so the physical daily capacity can be calculated by dividing the maximum quantity of waste that could be subject to biological treatment at any one time by the minimum residence time.

See the guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/legal-operator-and-competence-requirements-environmental-permits#record-the-operating-hours-of-your-waste-facility">level of competence and duration of attendance</a>.</p>

<p>‘compost’ means a solid particulate material that is the result of composting, which has been sanitised and stabilised, and which confers beneficial effects when added to soil, used as a component of growing media or used in another way in conjunction with plants.</p>

<p>‘compostable plastics’ means waste containing packaging or non-packaging items (or both) with a valid certificate of conformity to EN 13432, or equivalent standard for compostable and digestible items with a certificate issued by an independent certification body’ capable of fully biodegrading by a biological process to create compost or digest.</p>

<p>‘composting’ means the managed biological decomposition of biodegradable waste organic materials, under conditions that are predominantly aerobic and that allow the development of thermophilic temperatures as a result of biologically produced heat and that result in compost.</p>

<p>‘composting batch’ means an identifiable quantity of material that progresses through the composting system and when fully processed has similar characteristics throughout. For composting systems that operate on a continuous or plug-flow basis, batches will be taken to mean a series of ‘portions of production’.</p>

<p>‘direct discharge’ means discharge to a receiving water body.</p>

<p>‘emissions of substances not controlled by emission limits’ means emissions of substances to air, water or land from the activities, either from emission points specified in these standard rules or from other localised or diffuse sources, which are not controlled by an emission limit.</p>

<p>‘emissions to land’ means including emissions to groundwater.</p>

<p>‘groundwater’ means all water, which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil.</p>

<p>‘groundwater source protection zone’ - means as defined in the document titled ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/groundwater-protection-technical-guidance">Groundwater protection technical guidance</a>.</p>

<p>‘hazardous waste’ means as defined in the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 (as amended).</p>

<p>‘impermeable surface’ means a surface or pavement constructed to CIRIA 736 or demonstrated equivalent and maintained to a standard sufficient to prevent the transmission of liquids beyond the pavement surface, and should be read in conjunction with the term ‘sealed drainage system’.</p>

<p>‘incidental contamination’ means low levels of incidental waste, for example plastic, that may be contained within the feedstock waste.</p>

<p>‘maturation’ means a stage when by agitating and turning the compost it no longer results in reheating and the monitored temperature falls to ambient without the compost being too dry or anaerobic. Phytotoxins that are formed during the ‘active’ composting phase are metabolised by micro-organisms, which will result in the final material not being harmful to plants. This usually coincides with drop in pH toward neutral, and the conversion of ammonia into nitrates and recolonisation of beneficial micro-organisms. The maturation phase may need active management by turning to prevent the material becoming anaerobic.</p>

<p>‘nearest sensitive receptor’ means the nearest place to the permitted activities where people are likely to be for prolonged periods. This term would therefore apply to dwellings (including any associated gardens) and to many types of workplaces. We would not normally regard a place where people are likely to be present for less than 6 hours at one time as being a sensitive receptor. The term does not apply to those controlling the permitted facility, their staff when they are at work or to visitors to the facility, as their health is covered by Health and Safety at Work legislation, but would apply to dwellings occupied by the family of those controlling the composting facility.</p>

<p>‘operator’ means in relation to a regulated facility:</p>

<p>(a) the person who has control over the operation of the regulated facility,</p>

<p>(b) if the regulated facility has not yet been put into operation, the person who will have control over the regulated facility when it is put into operation, or</p>

<p>(c) if a regulated facility authorised by an environmental permit ceases to be in operation, the person who holds the environmental permit</p>

<p>‘open system’ means a composting system, such as outdoor, turned windrowing, where the waste and the resulting emissions are not fully contained during sanitisation. It includes other technologies such as aerated static piles.</p>

<p>‘pests’ means birds, vermin and insects.</p>

<p>‘pollution’ means emissions as a result of human activity which may –</p>

<ul>
  <li>be harmful to human health or the quality of the environment,</li>
  <li>cause offence to a human sense,</li>
  <li>result in damage to material property, or</li>
  <li>impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>‘post-consumer wood’ means manufactured treated wooden materials and products that have been discarded.</p>

<p>‘quarter’ means a calendar year quarter commencing on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October.</p>

<p>‘representative internal’ means representative monitoring at a point inside the windrows that will give a representative assessment of internal temperature. Note: larger windrows will require more bespoke temperature equipment to assess temperature profiles accurately.</p>

<p>‘sanitisation’ means the actively managed and intensive stage of composting, lasting for at least 5 days, characterised by high oxygen demand and temperatures of over 55°C, during which biological processes, together with conditions in the composting mass, eradicate human and animal pathogens or reduce them to acceptably low levels.</p>

<p>‘sealed drainage system’ means a drainage system with impermeable components which does not leak and which will ensure that:</p>

<p>(a) no liquid will run off the surface otherwise than via the system</p>

<p>(b) except where they may lawfully be discharged to foul sewer, all liquids entering the system are collected in a sealed sump</p>

<p>‘secondary containment’ means a system that is capable of containing loss from all above ground and underground storage tanks and that complies with CIRIA standard 736 or equivalent standard of design and construction.</p>

<p>‘secure storage’ means that all reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that the waste cannot escape and that members of the public are unable to gain access to the waste.</p>

<p>‘stable’ or ‘stabilised’ means the degree of processing and biodegradation at which the rate of biological activity has slowed to an acceptably low and consistent level and will not significantly increase under favourable, altered conditions.</p>

<p>‘stabilisation stage’ means the stage of composting following sanitisation, during which biological processes, together with conditions in the composting mass, give rise to compost that is nominally stable. Soluble carbon is usually not fully used and material is still considered to be in treatment. This stage is a managed process to prevent odours, dust and bioaerosols. There is also a residual risk of reheating and leachate breakout.</p>

<p>‘treated wood’ means any wood that has been chemically treated (such as to enhance or alter the performance of the original wood). Treatments may include penetrating oils, tar oil preservatives, waterborne preservatives, organic-based preservatives, boron and organo-metallic based preservatives, boron and halogenated flame retardants and surface treatments (including paint and veneer).</p>
