<h2>Examples of when a business can claim</h2>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-claim-super-deduction-or-special-rate-first-year-allowances">check if you can claim and if your plant and machinery qualifies</a>.</p>

<h3>When a business can claim the super-deduction</h3>

<p>On 1 December 2021, Alpha Ltd spends £10,000 on a new lathe. Alpha Ltd has a calendar year accounting period.</p>

<p>In the accounting period ending 31 December 2021, they can claim a super-deduction of 130% which equals £13,000 for this expenditure.</p>

<h3>When a business can claim the special rate first year allowance</h3>

<p>On 1 December 2021, Bravo Ltd spends £10,000 on a solar panel for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installation at its business premises</li>
  <li>use in its business</li>
</ul>

<p>In the accounting period ending 31 December 2021, they can claim the 50% special rate first year allowance which equals £5,000 for this expenditure.</p>

<p>The remaining balance of expenditure, after deducting the special rate first year allowance, is £5,000. This may be added to the special rate pool in the following accounting period and writing down allowances can be claimed.</p>

<h2>Example of working out the relevant percentage for the super-deduction</h2>

<p>Charlie Ltd has a calendar year accounting period ending 31 December 2023.</p>

<p>On 1 February 2023, Charlie Ltd incurs ‘super-deduction qualifying expenditure’ of £1,000. Because the accounting period ends after 1 April 2023, Charlie Ltd is entitled to claim a super-deduction at the relevant percentage rather than 130%.</p>

<p>There are 90 days in the accounting period before 1 April 2023. The total number of days in the period is 365.</p>

<p>To work out relevant percentage, they first divide 90 by 365. Then they multiply the result by 30 and add 100.</p>

<p>To work out the amount they can claim, they multiply their ‘super-deduction qualifying expenditure’ (which is £1,000) by the relevant percentage.</p>

<p>This gives them a super-deduction entitlement of £1,074.</p>

<h2>Examples of working out the balancing charge</h2>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/disposing-of-a-super-deduction-or-special-rate-first-year-allowance-asset">what you must do when disposing of a super-deduction or special rate first year allowance asset</a>.</p>

<h3>When disposal of a super-deduction asset takes place in an accounting period ending before 1 April 2023</h3>

<p>Delta Ltd has an accounting period ending 31 March.</p>

<p>On 1 May 2021, Delta Ltd incurs expenditure of £6,000 for a printer, and claims a super-deduction of £7,800 for the accounting period ending 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>On 1 February 2023, Delta Ltd sells the printer for £4,000 so the disposal value is £4,000.</p>

<p>Because they claimed the super-deduction for the full cost of the asset, the relevant proportion is 1.</p>

<p>The relevant proportion of the disposal value is:</p>

<p>1 x £4,000 = £4,000</p>

<p>Because their accounting period when they disposed of the asset ends before 1 April 2023, they multiply this result by 1.3.</p>

<p>£4,000 x 1.3 = £5,200</p>

<p>This means the balancing charge to be brought into account, in the accounting period ending 31 March 2023, is £5,200.</p>

<h3>When disposal of a super-deduction asset takes place in an accounting period that includes 1 April 2023</h3>

<p>Echo Ltd has an accounting period ending 31 December.</p>

<p>On 15 June 2021, Echo Ltd incurs expenditure of £20,000 for a new van and claims a super-deduction of £26,000 for the accounting period ending 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>On 1 December 2023, Echo Ltd sells the van for £10,000.</p>

<p>Because they claimed the super-deduction for the full cost of the asset, the relevant proportion is 1.</p>

<p>The relevant proportion of the disposal value is:</p>

<p>1 x £10,000 = £10,000</p>

<p>The accounting period when they disposed of the asset includes 1 April 2023, so this result needs to be multiplied by the relevant factor.</p>

<p>The number of days in the accounting period before 1 April 2023 is 90. The total number of days in the period is 365.</p>

<p>To work out relevant factor, they first divide 90 by 365. Then they multiply the result by 0.3 and add 1.</p>

<p>They multiply this result by £10,000, which gives them a balancing charge of £10,739.</p>

<h3>When disposing of a special rate first year allowance asset</h3>

<p>Foxtrot Ltd has an accounting period ending 31 December.</p>

<p>On 1 September 2022, Foxtrot Ltd incurs expenditure of £1,000,000 for a long-life asset and claims the 50% special rate first year allowance of £500,000 for the accounting period ending 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>On 1 September 2025, Foxtrot Ltd sells the asset for £500,000, which means the disposal value is £500,000.</p>

<p>The ‘relevant allowance expenditure’ is £1,000,000. As they claimed the special rate first year allowance for the full cost, this means the ‘total relevant expenditure’ is also £1,000,000.</p>

<p>They divide the ‘relevant allowance expenditure’ by 2:</p>

<p>£1,000,000 ÷ 2 = £500,000</p>

<p>They then divide this result by the ‘total relevant expenditure’ to get the ‘relevant proportion’:</p>

<p>£500,000 ÷ £1,000,000 = 0.5</p>

<p>To get the ‘relevant proportion’ of the disposal value, they multiply this result by the disposal value:</p>

<p>0.5 x £500,000 = £250,000</p>

<p>Because they claimed the allowance for the full cost of the asset, the ‘relevant proportion’ of the disposal value is half of the disposal value.</p>
