<p>The Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>) will manage the Lump Sum Exit Scheme.</p>

<p>You should read this scheme guidance before you apply for a lump sum payment. There are dates by which you must take action to qualify for lump sum payments.</p>

<h2>About the Lump Sum Exit Scheme</h2>

<div class="example">
<p>If you’re eligible, you can apply to the Lump Sum Exit Scheme until midnight on 30 September 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>The scheme is not expected to open for applications in future years.</p>

<p>The scheme is for Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) applicants in England who wish to leave farming, either to retire or take up a different occupation.</p>

<p>Agricultural land, <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements and business activity in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are not affected.</p>

<p>Once the lump sum payment is made, you will no longer be eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments or <a class="govuk-link" href="#claiming-future-bps-or-delinked-payments">delinked payments</a> (which are due to replace <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2024) in England. You will also not be eligible to enter into new agreements (or add land to existing agreements) under <a class="govuk-link" href="#applying-for-other-schemes">some other schemes</a> during the rest of the agricultural transition.</p>

<p>If you change your mind, you can withdraw your application by <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">writing to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr></a> at any time before we pay your lump sum. This will not affect any payment made to you, or due to you, under the Basic Payment Scheme.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/request-a-forecast-statement-for-a-lump-sum-payment">request a forecast statement</a> now to find out how much you could receive as a lump sum payment.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible</h2>

<p>For your farm business, you must have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claimed, and been eligible, for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the 2018 scheme year or in an earlier scheme year</li>
  <li>inherited agricultural land in England, or succeeded to an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy, after 15 May 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you receive the lump sum payment, you must do all the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transfer your agricultural land in England (but you can keep up to 5 hectares) or plant it with trees under a <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-your-land-into-woodland-creation-schemes">woodland creation scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>transfer grazing and pannage rights you have on <a class="govuk-link" href="#if-you-have-rights-on-common-land">common land in England</a>, where required</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#give-up-bps-entitlements">give up (surrender) your English <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you receive the lump sum, you can still work as an agricultural contractor or for other farmers.</p>

<h2>Transferring agricultural land</h2>

<p>To receive the lump sum, you must transfer out the land in England which was agricultural land ‘at your disposal’ on 17 May 2021 - the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021 application deadline. This land will have been eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Land was at your disposal if you were the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>owner-occupier, farming the land yourself or employing a contractor</li>
  <li>tenant with a Farm Business Tenancy under the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 or an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy (or equivalent).</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Agricultural land’ means arable land (including temporary grassland and fallow land), permanent grassland or permanent crops which was used mainly for an agricultural activity. The definitions of arable land, permanent grassland, permanent crops and agricultural activity are the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/basic-payment-scheme-2022-rules-for-2022/land">same as for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>For this scheme, agricultural land does not include land used mainly for a non-agricultural activity on 17 May 2021, which made it ineligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you claimed <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021, the area of land you need to transfer should be the sum of the ‘Total maximum area eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> (ha)’ figures shown in Part C on your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021 application.</p>

<h3>Land you do not need to transfer</h3>

<p>You do not need to transfer out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 5 hectares of that agricultural land</li>
  <li>agricultural land you plant with trees under a <a class="govuk-link" href="#entering-your-land-into-woodland-creation-schemes">woodland creation scheme</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As you only need to transfer out agricultural land, you do not need to transfer out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land parcels, or parts of land parcels, that were non-agricultural land on 17 May 2021 (such as woodland, even if this was eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>any buildings - for example, if you own your farmhouse you can choose to keep it</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not own the farmhouse and want to stay in it as a tenant, you will need to negotiate this with your landlord.</p>

<p>The scheme does not have any rules about what you do with any land you keep, except that you cannot use it to <a class="govuk-link" href="#claiming-future-bps-or-delinked-payments">claim future <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> or delinked payments</a>, or claim under <a class="govuk-link" href="#applying-for-other-schemes">some other schemes</a>. This means you could still keep animals or grow crops on it.</p>

<h2>How to transfer out the land</h2>

<p>You do not need to transfer out all of the land at the same time or to the same person. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#sole-trader">sole trader</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#partnership-or-limited-company">partnership or limited company</a> sections to find out who you cannot transfer land to.</p>

<h3>Owner-occupier</h3>

<p>If you are an owner-occupier of the land, you can transfer it out by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selling it</li>
  <li>gifting it</li>
  <li>renting it out under a Farm Business Tenancy with a minimum term of 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>The Farm Business Tenancy must not include break clauses which are based on a date, such as halfway through the tenancy, if this date is in the first 5 years of the tenancy. Other break clauses, such as in the event of the death or bankruptcy of the tenant are allowed.</p>

<h3>Tenant</h3>

<p>If you are a tenant of the land, you can transfer it out by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surrendering the tenancy to your landlord or ending the tenancy having served a Notice to Quit on your landlord</li>
  <li>assigning the tenancy (transferring it to someone else) if your tenancy allows this</li>
  <li>succession - if you have an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy with succession rights</li>
</ul>

<p>Land also counts as transferred-out if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a tenancy expires</li>
  <li>the landlord ends a tenancy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sole trader</h3>

<p>If you are a sole trader, you cannot transfer the land to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your spouse or civil partner</li>
  <li>someone you are cohabiting with as a couple</li>
</ul>

<p>You can transfer the land to anyone else, such as your son or daughter.</p>

<h3>Partnership or limited company</h3>

<p>If you claim the lump sum payment as a partnership or limited company (or other corporate body), you cannot transfer the land to a partner or shareholder in the business. This rule does not apply if only some partners or shareholders leave the business and <a class="govuk-link" href="#partnerships-and-limited-companies">meet certain conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>When you must transfer the land</h2>

<p>You must transfer out the agricultural land and <a class="govuk-link" href="#provide-supporting-evidence">provide evidence</a> of this by 31 May 2024.</p>

<p>If you choose to, you can transfer agricultural land before you apply for the scheme. If you have already transferred out, or started to transfer out, all or some of the agricultural land that was at your disposal on 17 May 2021, you can still apply for a lump sum <a class="govuk-link" href="#transferring-agricultural-land">if you meet the transfer rules</a>.</p>

<h3>When you can ask for an extension</h3>

<p>You can apply for an extension beyond 31 May 2024 if either of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy with succession rights and the succession is due to be considered by a tribunal, arbitrator or court</li>
  <li>the land is part of a probate case</li>
</ul>

<p>To ask for an extension, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> by post or email</a> with supporting evidence as soon as you know you will need one. For example, evidence that the succession of your Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy is with a tribunal.</p>

<p>Emails must come from addresses registered on the Rural Payments service with relevant permissions for the business. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-payments-if-a-registered-customer-dies">If a registered customer has died</a> their personal representatives should contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>If you have rights on common land</h3>

<p>You may have a right to graze land in common with other farmers. This land may be registered as common land, or it may be other shared grazing, such as stinted or regulated pastures. This is referred to as common land in this guidance.</p>

<p>You must transfer out any rights to graze or rights to pannage that you hold for common land where these rights are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attached to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#transferring-agricultural-land">agricultural land you need to transfer out</a>
</li>
  <li>held in gross (are not attached to land) but relate to common land in England</li>
</ul>

<p>For rights which are attached to agricultural land, if the rights are attached to more land than you intend to transfer, you must transfer a proportionate number of rights.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>If you have 50 rights attached to 10 hectares of land and you transfer 5 hectares, you will have transferred 50% of the land which the rights are attached to. You must therefore transfer 50% of your rights, which is 25 rights.</p>
</div>

<p>You do not need to transfer rights if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘unquantified’, which means they do not give grazing or pannage rights for a certain number of livestock, such as in the New Forest</li>
  <li>attached to a house or other building and not to agricultural land</li>
</ul>

<p>If you own grazing or pannage rights which are attached to land, the rights and the land need to be transferred together. You can transfer them by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selling them</li>
  <li>gifting them</li>
  <li>leasing them for a minimum of 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>The existing law for rights of commons means rights which are attached to land cannot usually be leased separately from the land for more than 2 years on the same lease. This 2-year limit does not apply where the rights are being leased together with the land.</p>

<p>If you own grazing rights held in gross, you can transfer them by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selling them</li>
  <li>gifting them</li>
  <li>leasing them for a minimum of 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have leased-in grazing or pannage rights, you can transfer them by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surrendering the lease</li>
  <li>assigning the lease (transferring it to someone else), if your lease allows this</li>
  <li>succession of an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy if the grazing rights are 
attached to this</li>
</ul>

<p>Rights also count as transferred-out if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lease expires</li>
  <li>the landlord ends the lease</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>You must transfer the rights by 31 May 2024.</p>
</div>

<p>The restrictions on who sole traders and partnerships or limited companies can transfer land to also apply to rights on common land.</p>

<p>You can ask for an extension in the same circumstances as for <a class="govuk-link" href="#when-you-must-transfer-the-land">transferring your land</a>.</p>

<h2>Entering your land into woodland creation schemes</h2>

<p>You can enter some, or all, of your agricultural land into woodland creation schemes instead of transferring it. These schemes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any Nature for Climate Fund woodland creation scheme, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/england-woodland-creation-offer">England Woodland Creation Offer</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/england-woodland-creation-partnerships-grants-and-advice-table">Woodland Creation Partnerships</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-carbon-guarantee">Woodland Carbon Guarantee</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="example">
<p>You must be accepted under the woodland creation scheme and have planted this land with trees by 31 May 2024. To ensure you meet this deadline, you will need to contact the relevant administering body in plenty of time to get an agreement.</p>
</div>

<h2>Give up <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements</h2>

<p>To receive a lump sum payment, you have until 31 May 2024 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give up (surrender) all English <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> that you own which are not leased-out</li>
  <li>confirm that you will give up any English <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> that you own which are leased out, with the surrender coming into effect at the end of the entitlements’ lease (it doesn’t matter when the entitlements lease ends)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can ask for an extension in the same circumstances as for <a class="govuk-link" href="#when-you-must-transfer-the-land">transferring your land</a>.</p>

<p>Entitlements that you have leased-in do not have to be given up to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, but your lump sum may be reduced if they are not given up.</p>

<p>To give up <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements, you need to fill in and send a Lump Sum Exit Scheme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-exit-scheme-entitlements-and-evidence-form">entitlements and evidence form</a> to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>.  <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will use the information on this form to cancel the entitlements. If you have leased-in entitlements and the lessor (owner of the entitlements) has agreed to give them up, you should ask them to fill in and sign the relevant part of that form.</p>

<p>You do not need to do anything with any leased-in entitlements which are not being given up to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, but your lump sum <a class="govuk-link" href="#reductions-to-the-lump-sum-if-you-do-not-give-up-enough-entitlements">may be reduced</a> if they are not given up. <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will return these to the owner of the entitlements (the lessor) when we make your lump sum payment (or when the entitlements’ lease ends if that is before we pay your lump sum).</p>

<p>You can use the entitlements to <a class="govuk-link" href="#claiming-future-bps-or-delinked-payments">claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr></a> before you give them up. To claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022, you will need to hold entitlements on 16 May 2022. If you give them up after this date, it will not affect your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 payment as long as you meet the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> scheme rules. To claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2023, you will need to hold entitlements on 15 May 2023.</p>

<h2>Partnerships and limited companies</h2>

<p>If your business is a partnership or limited company, you need to apply to the Lump Sum Exit Scheme as a partnership or limited company, as you do for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>. If all the members of the business are leaving, the partnership or limited company will need to meet the normal rules on <a class="govuk-link" href="#transferring-agricultural-land">transferring agricultural land</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#give-up-bps-entitlements">giving up <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements</a>.</p>

<p>If only some members of the business want to leave or retire from farming, such as parents leaving the business to their children, the partnership or limited company can still apply for a lump sum payment if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a partner with 50% or more interest in the profits of the partnership, or more than one partner with a combined interest of 50% or more, leaves the partnership</li>
  <li>a shareholder with 50% or more equity share capital in the company, or more than one shareholder with combined shares of 50% or more, sells or gifts their shares</li>
  <li>the partners or shareholders leaving the business transfer the agricultural land used by that business if it is held, or partly held, in their name</li>
</ul>

<p>If these conditions have been met, the partners or shareholders who are leaving can transfer the agricultural land to the remaining members of the business. For example, if a tenancy is in the name of more than one partner, the tenancy needs to be changed to remove the partner(s) leaving the business. A land transfer is not needed if the agricultural land is not held in the name of the partners or shareholders leaving the business.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will make the lump sum payment to the partnership or limited company. It is up to the partnership or limited company to decide how to allocate the money.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Farmer A and Farmer B, each have a 50% interest in the profits of the partnership and Farmer A wants to exit. Farmer A could leave the partnership and transfer the land to Farmer B, who could continue to farm the land.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Farmer A has a 30% interest in the profits of the partnership, Farmer B has a 30% interest and Farmer C has a 40% interest. Farmer A and Farmer B both want to exit. As their total interest is more than 50%, they can leave the partnership and transfer the land to Farmer C, who can continue to farm the land.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Farmer A has a 30% interest in the profits of the partnership and Farmer B has a 70% interest. Farmer A wants to exit. As Farmer A’s interest is less than 50%, a lump sum cannot be claimed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Where only some partners in the partnership or shareholders in the limited company are leaving, the partnership or limited company must still <a class="govuk-link" href="#give-up-bps-entitlements">give up the business’s <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements</a> before the lump sum is paid.</p>

<p>Once the lump sum payment is made, the remaining business cannot claim further <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments or delinked payments in England. They can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for any other schemes they are eligible for</li>
  <li>continue with existing scheme agreements, such as Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>), if they continue to meet the rules for that scheme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Claiming future <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> or delinked payments</h2>

<p>Applicants who receive a lump sum payment, are not eligible for more <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delinked-payments-replacing-the-basic-payment-scheme">delinked payments</a> in England. Receiving a lump sum will not prevent you claiming <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments or delinked payments for any other businesses you are involved with, such as in the examples below.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If you receive a lump sum as a sole trader, you cannot claim future BPS or delinked payments as a sole trader. However, if you are also a partner in another business, and that partnership does not receive a lump sum, you could still claim BPS or delinked payments for that partnership.</li>
  <li>If a partnership receives a lump sum, the partnership cannot claim future BPS or delinked payments. However, if a partner in that business also has a business as a sole trader, they could still claim BPS or delinked payments as a sole trader.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Existing scheme agreements and grants</h2>

<p>Meeting the Lump Sum Exit Scheme rules and leaving farming may mean that you no longer meet the rules of other scheme agreements and grants you already have, such as Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/farming-investment-fund">Farming Investment Fund</a>. In some cases, you may need to repay money you have received under those schemes.</p>

<p>Read the relevant sections if you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#countryside-stewardship-and-environmental-stewardship-schemes"><abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, Environmental Stewardship (<abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) agreement</a> or have received money under a <a class="govuk-link" href="#woodland-schemes">woodland scheme</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an agreement under another scheme or have received a grant that may be affected by you leaving farming, please contact the relevant administering body to find out what options are available to you.</p>

<p>If you are a member of a Fruit and Vegetable Producer Organisation (<abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>), please tell your <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr> that you plan to apply for the lump sum and ask them to contact <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to discuss any impact on the <abbr title="Producer Organisation">PO</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Countryside Stewardship and Environmental Stewardship schemes</h3>

<p>If you have a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> encourage you to transfer your agreement to those taking on the land. This will mean that environmental benefits will continue on that land.</p>

<p>You should tell the person taking on the land about your agreement before you transfer the land. They may want to take the agreement on. You will not have to repay any money if you successfully transfer your agreement.</p>

<p>You should also tell <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> as soon as possible before you transfer your agreement land.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreements, you will not have to repay any money you received if you request to transfer your agreement. This applies to both EU funded and domestically funded <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreements even if the new owner or occupier does not take on the agreement. It does not apply to <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Capital Grants.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Capital Grants, you cannot transfer your agreement during the 2-year agreement period. If you sell or let all or part of the land under your Capital Grants agreement to another party, we will end the agreement on those land parcels. You may need to repay all or part of the grant payments you have already received.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreements, you may have to repay all or part of the money you received if the new owner or occupier does not continue with the agreement. Where a Higher Level Stewardship agreement naturally ends (including where no offer to extend your agreement has been made and where an extension has been offered but you have not taken it up), you would not have to repay any money received.</p>

<p>You should <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">write to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> if you want to end your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement</a>, rather than transfer it to the new owner or occupier. You may need to repay all or part of the payments you have received. Your obligations under the agreement do not end until we have received this repayment.</p>

<p>For details about transferring and ending <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreements, you should read:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Woodland schemes</h3>

<p>You do not have to transfer land which was woodland on 17 May 2021 (even if it was used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), because woodland is not agricultural land.</p>

<p>If you choose to transfer land which is in a woodland scheme, you should contact the relevant administering body. For woodland schemes managed by the Forestry Commission contact:</p>

<h4>Bucks Horn Oak Administrative Hub (for counties in the east):</h4>

<ul>
  <li>South East and London</li>
  <li>East and East Midlands</li>
  <li>Yorkshire and North East</li>
</ul>

<p>Telephone: 0300 067 4420</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:adminhub.buckshornoak@forestrycommission.gov.uk">adminhub.buckshornoak@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a></p>

<h4>Bullers Hill Administrative Hub (for counties in the west):</h4>

<ul>
  <li>South West</li>
  <li>North West and West Midlands</li>
</ul>

<p>Telephone: 0300 067 4960</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:adminhub.bullershill@forestrycommission.gov.uk">adminhub.bullershill@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>You may need to repay all or part of the payment you have received under that scheme if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you end your agreement early</li>
  <li>those taking on the land do not agree to take on the obligations of the existing grant agreement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applying for other schemes</h2>

<p>If you are paid a lump sum, you will not be eligible to enter into new agreements (or add land to existing agreements) under the following schemes, unless you first repay the lump sum:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-how-the-scheme-will-work-in-2022">Sustainable Farming Incentive</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-lump-sum-payment-to-leave-or-retire-from-farming/how-lump-sum-payments-affect-some-countryside-stewardship-options">some options under <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr></a> and some options under Local Nature Recovery.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because these schemes (or options in schemes) are mainly on agricultural land and the Lump Sum Exit Scheme is for those people who are leaving farming. This rule applies during the rest of the agricultural transition which is due to run until the end of 2027.</p>

<p>Where only some partners in a partnership or shareholders in a limited company leave, the remaining partners and shareholders can apply to these other schemes without the lump sum having to be repaid.</p>

<p>You can apply for any other schemes you are eligible for, such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-free-business-advice-for-your-farm">Future Farming Resilience Fund</a> (until you stop claiming <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> and have left farming) or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/farming-investment-fund">Farming Investment Fund</a> (if you meet the rules of that scheme).</p>

<h3>Taking over land from a lump sum applicant</h3>

<p>If someone takes over land from a lump sum applicant, they can use that land to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> if they have enough <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements, or if they buy or lease some from someone else.</p>

<p>They can also apply for payments available under new schemes that are being rolled out over the agricultural transition when they become available.</p>

<h2>How the lump sum is calculated</h2>

<p>The lump sum payment is based on a ‘reference amount’.</p>

<h3>Calculation of the reference amount</h3>

<p>The reference amount is based on the average <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments made to your business for the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019, <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2020 and <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021 scheme years. This includes any young farmer payment or greening payment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will add up your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019, <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2020 and <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021 payments and divide by 3. We will include reductions applied for over-claiming land, but will ignore the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>over-claim penalties (which can be applied to <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments on top of over-claim reductions)</li>
  <li>reductions and penalties for not meeting the greening rules</li>
  <li>late application penalties</li>
  <li>penalties for not declaring all agricultural land parcels</li>
  <li>cross compliance penalties</li>
  <li>financial discipline reductions</li>
  <li>reductions to amounts above €150,000</li>
  <li>progressive reductions for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>If you also claimed <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> on entitlements in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, your reference amount will be based only on the part of your payment which relates to your English entitlements.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> paid your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019 payment in euros, this will be converted to sterling using the exchange rate applied in the 2019 scheme year (€1 = £0.89092).</p>

<p>The reference amount will be capped at £42,500. This means that if your reference amount is £42,500 or less, you will not be affected by the cap.</p>

<h3>Calculation of the lump sum payment amount</h3>

<div class="example">
<p>Lump sum payment (£) = reference amount (capped at £42,500) x 2.35</p>
</div>

<p>This calculation means that (except for farmers affected by the cap), the lump sum will be equivalent to the amount you could have received in Direct Payments for 2022 to 2027. This takes account of the announced progressive reductions for 2022 to 2024 and continued gradual reductions until the end of 2027. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-farming-changes-to-farming-in-england">how farming is changing</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If a farmer’s reference amount is £40,000, their lump sum would be £40,000 x 2.35 = £94,000.</li>
  <li>If a farmer’s reference amount is £50,000, their lump sum would be £42,500 (as the cap is applied) x 2.35 = £99,875.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Reductions to the lump sum if you do not give up enough entitlements</h3>

<p>Your lump sum payment will be reduced if you do not give up (surrender) enough English <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, by value. For example, this could be the case if you have sold or leased out entitlements since you used them to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021. This is to avoid <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> paying twice, both under the Lump Sum Exit Scheme and <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> to another farmer, using entitlements you have transferred to them.</p>

<p>If you give up all the entitlements you used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021 to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>, your lump sum payments will not be reduced. This is shown in example 1.</p>

<p>Your lump sum will be reduced if Figure A is less than Figure B.</p>

<h4>Figure A</h4>
<p>This is the total value of English <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements you give up to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> after 17 May 2021. It will not include any entitlements you lease out to other farmers after 17 May 2021, even if you give them up at the end of the lease. If you have leased-in entitlements and these are given up to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> before your lump sum is paid, these will be included.</p>

<h4>Figure B</h4>
<p>This is the total value of English <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements you used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021. If you did not claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021, Figure B is the total value of entitlements you used in your most recent <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim in the 2019 to 2021 reference period.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will use the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2021 entitlement rates when working out Figure A and Figure B.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>If you claimed payment on 20 entitlements in the non-Severely Disadvantaged Area (non-SDA) for BPS 2021 scheme year, then the value of entitlements you used to claim BPS 2021 is:</p>

<p>Figure B: 20 x £233.30 = £4,666.00</p>

<p>For no lump sum reduction, the total value of entitlements you give up to RPA (Figure A) must not be less than Figure B, in this case £4,660.00.</p>

<p>This means you must give up entitlements with a total value of at least £4,666.00. So, for example, if you give up 20 non-SDA entitlements (20 x £233.30 = £4,666.00), your lump sum will not be reduced.</p>
</div>

<p>If Figure A is less than Figure B, you will only receive a percentage of your full lump sum.</p>

<p>This is worked out as follows:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Lump sum percentage (%) = (Figure A ÷ Figure B) x 100</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>If you claimed payment on 20 non-SDA entitlements for the BPS 2021 scheme year, their total value was 20 x £233.30 = £4,666.00 (Figure B).</p>

<p>If you only give up 15 non-SDA entitlements to RPA, their total value is 15 x £233.30 = £3,499.50 (Figure A).</p>

<p>Lump sum percentage % = 3,499.50 ÷ 4,660.00 x 100 = 75%</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will send you a <a class="govuk-link" href="#what-youll-get-back-after-checks-on-your-application">post application statement</a> to tell you what percentage reduction you could receive.</p>

<h2>Claiming <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 and 2023</h2>

<p>You may wish to apply for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 as well as applying for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme. This will protect you if you then find that you are not eligible for the lump sum or cannot complete the transfer of your land in time.</p>

<p>To apply for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022, you will need to meet the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> scheme rules. You will need to have eligible land at your disposal, and hold <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements, on 16 May 2022. If you transfer land you have used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> before the end of 2022, it is still your responsibility to make sure the land:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stays eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> for the rest of the year (or is withdrawn from your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application)</li>
  <li>meets the cross compliance rules for the whole year (unless the person you have transferred it to – called the transferee - applied for any rural payments, in which case they take over this responsibility)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are transferring land you have used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in that year, you should make sure that any contract you have with the new owner or tenant is clear about what happens if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any of the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>, or cross compliance rules are broken</li>
  <li>inspectors or field officers are refused access to the land</li>
</ul>

<p>The same rules will apply if you claim for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2023.</p>

<p>If you receive a <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 or <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2023 payment and later meet the rules of the Lump Sum Exit Scheme, the value of any <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments made will be deducted from the lump sum due. Claiming both <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> and the lump sum payment will not lead to an overpayment if you meet the rules for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> and the Lump Sum Exit Scheme.</p>

<h2>Business changes since <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2018</h2>

<p>There may have been changes to your business since <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2018 which affect the lump sum payment you could receive. This could affect whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you meet the requirement to have claimed <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2018 or earlier (unless an exception applies)</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019 to 2021 payments of a previous business can be included in the calculation of your reference amount</li>
</ul>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-payments-if-the-structure-of-your-business-is-changing">complete the relevant forms</a> to tell <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> about a merger or split if you did not do this at the time of the change.</p>

<h3>New business</h3>

<p>If your business has been given a new Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>), <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will normally treat it as a new business which cannot benefit from the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim history of a previous business.</p>

<p>This means we will not take account of the previous business when checking whether you meet the requirement to have claimed <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2018 or earlier and when <a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-of-the-reference-amount">calculating your reference amount</a>.</p>

<p>However, there are exceptions for inheritance cases, business mergers and business splits.</p>

<h3>Inherited businesses or land</h3>

<p>If you have inherited all or part of a business from a farmer who claimed <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in one of the years 2019 to 2021, you can ask us to take that <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim history into account. To do that, you will need to tell <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> about the inheritance on your Lump Sum Exit Scheme application form.</p>

<p>Where part of a business has been inherited, the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019 to 2021 payments (<a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-of-the-reference-amount">before some reductions and penalties</a>) made to the original business will be divided between the new businesses. This will be based on the split of the value of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements transferred to each of the new businesses when the inheritance happened.</p>

<p>If you inherited agricultural land after 15 May 2018, you do not need to have claimed <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2018 or earlier.</p>

<p>If a sole trader dies and the executor or administrator applies for the lump sum payment, this will be treated as the same business. Any lump sum payment which is due will be paid once <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> has been sent a grant of probate or letter of administration.</p>

<h3>Merged businesses</h3>

<p>If two or more businesses have merged since <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2018, the merged business can ask us to take the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim history of the original businesses into account for the lump sum payment. To do that, the new business will need to tell <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> about the business merger on their Lump Sum Exit Scheme application form</p>

<p>The reference amount for the new business will take account of the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019 to 2021 payments (<a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-of-the-reference-amount">before some reductions and penalties</a>) made to all of the previous businesses. At least one of the people with shares in the new merged business must have had shares in one of the original businesses.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Business A and Business B claimed BPS in 2018 and 2019 and merged to form a new Business C. Business C claimed BPS in 2020 and 2021. If Business C tells us about the business merger on their Lump Sum Exit Scheme application form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business C will be treated as having met the requirement to have claimed BPS in 2018 or earlier</li>
  <li>the BPS payments (<a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-of-the-reference-amount">before some reductions and penalties</a>) made to Business A and Business B for BPS 2019 will be included in the reference amount for Business C</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Split businesses</h3>

<p>If a business has split into two or more businesses since <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2018, one or all of the new businesses can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for a lump sum payment</li>
  <li>ask us to take the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim history of the original businesses into account – by telling us about the business split on their Lump Sum Exit Scheme application form</li>
</ul>

<p>When calculating the reference amount for the new business(es), the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2019 to 2021 payments (<a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-of-the-reference-amount">before some reductions and penalties</a>) made to the original business before its split will be divided between the new businesses. This will be based on the split of the value of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements transferred to each of the new businesses when the business split happened.</p>

<p>Each new business would only qualify for a share of the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim history if at least one of the people with shares in the new business had shares in the original business.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Business A claimed BPS in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and then split into 2 new businesses (B and C). 60% of the value of business A’s entitlements were transferred to business B and 40% to business C. Business B and Business C each claimed BPS in 2021. Business C applies for a lump sum payment. If Business C tells us about the business split on their Lump Sum Exit Scheme application form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business C will be treated as having met the requirement to have claimed BPS in 2018 or earlier</li>
  <li>40% of the BPS payments (<a class="govuk-link" href="#calculation-of-the-reference-amount">before some reductions and penalties</a>) made to Business A for BPS 2019 and 2020 will be included in the reference amount for Business C</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Becoming a partnership</h3>

<p>If a sole trader has become a partnership since <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2018, <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> treat this as the same business and the Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) should be the same. This means the partnership can use the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> claim history of the sole trader for the lump sum payment.</p>

<h2>Tax treatment for lump sum payments</h2>

<p>The government intends to introduce legislation to provide clarity that the Lump Sum Exit Scheme payments will be treated as capital in nature and will be subject to capital gains tax, or corporation tax in the case of incorporated entities. The existing capital gains reliefs will be available where the qualifying criteria are met.</p>

<p>The capital treatment will also apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="#claiming-bps-in-2022-and-2023">interim Direct Payments</a>, which will be deducted from the lump sum payment amount once the scheme rules have been met. Income treatment will apply to Direct Payments if the qualifying conditions for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme are not met. Further guidance on timing and abortive transactions will be provided by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will consider whether any steps may be necessary to prevent capital treatment being applied where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transactions are undertaken which do not support the policy objective</li>
  <li>there is a possibility of tax avoidance</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> will provide more details when they are available.</p>

<h2>How to apply for a lump sum payment</h2>

<p>Before you apply to the scheme, you may wish to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/request-a-forecast-statement-for-a-lump-sum-payment">request a forecast statement</a> showing the lump sum payment you could receive.</p>

<p>After reading the scheme rules to check if you’re eligible, you can apply to the scheme through the Rural Payments service. You need to have the ‘Business details: Full Permission’ level to apply. If you do not have the right permission, you’ll need to ask someone with ‘Business details: Full Permission’ to change your permission level.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>You can apply until midnight on 30 September 2022.</p>
</div>

<h3>Online applications</h3>

<p>As a registered customer, log in to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. You’ll need your customer reference number (CRN) and password.</p>

<p>On the businesses and messages page, click on the relevant business (‘View business’). Then from the business overview screen click on ’Apply for the Lump Sum Exit Scheme’ in the left-hand column under ‘Basic Payment Scheme’.</p>

<p>You should then follow the on-screen ‘Help’ to complete your application. If you would like a record of your application, you will need to take screen prints of the information you enter in your application before you submit it.</p>

<p>Once you press ‘submit’, you should see a message confirming that your application has been submitted successfully which you can print for your records.</p>

<h3>Paper applications</h3>

<p>If you cannot apply through the Rural Payments service, use the application form on GOV.UK. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-exit-scheme-application-form">Follow the instructions</a> on the application form page. You may want to make a copy of your application form for your own records.</p>

<h2>What you’ll get back after checks on your application</h2>

<p><abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will check your application and then send you a post application statement, or we will send you a letter if you’re not eligible. We will check that you <a class="govuk-link" href="#who-is-eligible">meet the requirement</a> to have claimed, and been eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the 2018 scheme year, or in an earlier scheme year, or qualify for an exemption.</p>

<p>The post application statement will give you an updated forecast of your lump sum payment, based on the latest data we hold for you. If you told us about a business merger, split or inheritance on your application form and this has changed your reference amount, this will be taken into account in your post application statement.</p>

<p>You must submit your supporting evidence to <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> before you’ll get paid.</p>

<h3>Provide supporting evidence</h3>

<p>Fill in the Lump Sum Exit Scheme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-exit-scheme-entitlements-and-evidence-form">entitlements and evidence form</a> to:</p>

  <li>show that you’ve transferred grazing and pannage rights you have on common land in England (where required)</li>

<p>You will need to ask an agricultural valuer or a solicitor to fill in the certificate at the end of the form to confirm that you have:</p>

<ul>

</ul>
