<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK.</a></p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 117</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact your nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-berne">British embassy</a>, high commission or consulate on +41 31 359 77 00. Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you want to report the incident to the police in Switzerland</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</li>
  <li>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy or consulate on +41 31 359 77 00 and they can offer you consular support.</li>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Switzerland</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The British embassy or consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK</li>
  <li>They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators</li>
  <li>If you are travelling with one, you can also report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</li>
  <li>It is your choice on whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated.</li>
  <li>If you need more time to decide whether you want to report the incident to the police, but want forensic evidence to be secured and stored in the event you decide later that you do want the incident to be investigated, you are able to go to specific clinics for a confidential forensic examination. This procedure is called “vertrauliche Spurensicherung” (German), “Examen médicolégal confidentiel” (French) and “Esame forense riservato” (Italian). You are not required to report the assault to the police and you should not be put under pressure to report it. For details of the facilities in Switzerland offering this service please see Annex 1 to this guide.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence</li>
  <li>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London</li>
  <li>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police</li>
  <li>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened.  However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</li>
  <li>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Switzerland: what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</li>
  <li>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
  <li>You will be asked to briefly describe what happened so that immediate action can be taken to identify the alleged offender;</li>
  <li>Evidence such as the clothing and underwear you were wearing and other items that the offender has touched will help the police to gather evidence and to build a criminal case;</li>
  <li>You should not wash yourself or clean or alter clothing or other items;</li>
  <li>If possible make notes about what happened during the assault before making the report, so that you can refer to them if necessary;</li>
  <li>You can bring a person you trust with you to the police station;</li>
  <li>The police officer will give you the police reference number for future reference as well as the contact details of the police officer responsible for the case;</li>
  <li>The police will take you to the hospital for a medical and forensic examination.</li>
  <li>You can also go directly to a hospital and describe there what happened. The hospital will in principle inform the police on your behalf if you give consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The medical findings may be important evidence if the case goes to court. Therefore, if you want the assault to be investigated you will need to give consent to the doctor at the hospital to share information with the police.</li>
  <li>You should not take a shower or bath before the examination, so that any evidence is preserved.</li>
  <li>You will have a forensic medical examination as well as tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. This includes taking photographs to document any injuries.</li>
  <li>Ask for a prescription for emergency contraception (GER: “die Pille danach”; FR: “la pilule du lendemain”; IT: “la pillola del giorno dopo”)</li>
  <li>Ask to be informed and advised about what treatment is recommended in your particular case to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>HIV PEP medication (Post-exposure prophylaxis) is a treatment that can prevent HIV infection. It needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</li>
  <li>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective (GER: “die Pille danach”; FR: “la pilule du lendemain”; IT: “la pillola del giorno dopo”)</li>
  <li>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Police investigations in Switzerland: what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The process of reporting an assault may differ from what you expect of UK police proceedings. Ask to be informed of what your rights are as a victim of crime.</li>
  <li>Where possible a female officer will be in attendance but this might not always be possible depending on the police station or town.</li>
  <li>Normally you would first speak with an officer at the nearest police station, who will record a criminal complaint (GER: “Strafanzeige”; FR: “plainte”; IT: “Denuncia per reati”). The officer then will refer the case to a criminal investigator, who will be responsible for interviewing you about the assault and for investigating your case.</li>
  <li>After the police has concluded their investigations, they will refer the case to the public prosecutor (GER: “Staatsanwaltschaft”; FR: “ministère public”; IT: “Procuratore Pubblico) who needs to decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case to court. At that point another interview may be necessary.</li>
  <li>If you wish to be informed of the future developments of the case, request that you wish to be informed of the result of the criminal proceedings or the court trial. Your request will then be added to the investigation file, so that the public prosecutor and judge knows that you wish to be kept informed of the future stages of the investigation and the result of the trial. You can also request to be kept informed at a later stage, by submitting a request for information to the relevant public prosecutor’s office. You should state the public prosecutor’s reference number, or court reference number, as well as the accused offender’s name, if you have those details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If the case goes to court, you will be required to testify again as a witness. If you do not speak the local language, you have the right to ask for an interpreter.</li>
  <li>You can apply to have the public excluded from the court room during your testimony. You can also apply to have the accused offender excluded from the court room during your testimony, if they are an acquaintance, relative or friend. If you are a minor, you can have yourself represented by your parents or your lawyer. You can also request to the court if you may submit a written statement.</li>
  <li>It is recommendable that you seek legal advice from a lawyer. A list of English-speaking lawyers is available on the website of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.</li>
  <li>Depending on the case, you may be able to join the public prosecution as a private accessory prosecutor (GER: “Privatkläger”; FR: “partie civile”; IT: “parte civile”). As a private accessory prosecutor you have the right to access criminal files including testimonies of the accused as well as medical documents and are able follow the investigation process closely. In doing so, it must be noted that the legal authorities can impose the costs of the proceedings on you if these are discontinued or if the accused is acquitted.</li>
  <li>Depending on the nature of the crime, the canton in which the crime took place may fully cover the victim’s (or their Next of Kin’s) lawyer fees. This especially applies to victims of crimes against life such as murder and manslaughter, or rape and sexual assault. Each canton’s respective victim support office (GER: “Opferhilfe”; FR: “Aide aux victimes d’infractions”; IT: “Delegato per l’aiuto alle vittime di reati) is responsible for providing financial support to victims. The decisive factor for assessing a claim for financial support is whether being a victim can be made credible. Relevant evidence may be requested for the purpose of assessing your entitlement to cost contributions/exemptions.</li>
  <li>If the canton does not cover the lawyer fees, and you are on a low income, you may be eligible for legal aid (GER: “Unentgeltliche Rechtspflege”; FR: “Assistance judiciaire”; IT: “Assistenza giudiziaria”). You can apply directly to the relevant court for this, either with or without the help of a lawyer.</li>
  <li>You can receive psychological support from a victim support organisation during the trial. Please see below for a list of Support Organisations in Switzerland and in the UK.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>
