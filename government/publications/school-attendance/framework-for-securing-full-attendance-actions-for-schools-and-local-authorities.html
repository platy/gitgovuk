<h2>Principles of an effective whole school attendance strategy</h2>

<p>This section sets out the principles underpinning an effective whole school strategy for attendance, which requires commitment from every member of the school community.</p>

<h3>Leadership and management</h3>

<p>1. Offer a clear vision for attendance, underpinned by high expectations and core values, which are communicated to and understood by staff, pupils and families.</p>

<p>2. Make sure staff, pupils and families understand that absence from school is a potential safeguarding risk and understand their role in keeping children safe.</p>

<p>3. Expect good attendance and punctuality from all members of the school community and make sure that pupils understand its importance.</p>

<p>4. Convey clear messages about how absence affects attainment, wellbeing and wider outcomes. Empower staff to take responsibility for attendance.</p>

<p>5. Recognise attendance as an important area of school improvement. Make sure it is resourced appropriately (including through effective use of pupil premium funding) to create, build and maintain systems and performance.</p>

<p>6. Have a designated attendance champion in the senior leadership team with clearly assigned responsibilities which are identified within the attendance policy, escalation of procedures and school improvement plan.</p>

<p>7. Make sure staff receive professional development and support to deploy attendance systems effectively.</p>

<p>8. Governors should have an accurate view of school attendance and engage in escalation procedures where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Relationships and communication</h3>

<p>1. Build respectful relationships with staff, pupils, families and other stakeholders in order to secure their trust and engagement. Make sure there is a welcoming and positive culture across the school.</p>

<p>2. Communicate openly and honestly with staff, pupils and families about their expectations of school life and performance so that they understand what to expect and what is expected of them.</p>

<p>3. Liaise with other agencies working with pupils and their families to support attendance, for example, where a young person has a social worker or is otherwise vulnerable.</p>

<p>4. Model respectful relationships and appropriate communication for staff and pupils. This will help relationships between pupils and staff to reflect a positive and respectful culture. All staff members should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat pupils with dignity, build relationships rooted in mutual respect and observe proper boundaries</li>
  <li>take into consideration the vulnerability of some pupils and the ways in which this might contribute to absence, handling confidential information sensitively</li>
  <li>understand the importance of school as a place of safety where pupils can enjoy trusted relationships with staff and pupils particularly for children with a social worker and those who have experienced adversity</li>
  <li>communicate effectively with families regarding pupils’ attendance and well-being</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Parents and carers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat staff with respect</li>
  <li>actively support the work of the school</li>
  <li>call on staff for help when they need it</li>
  <li>communicate as early as possible circumstances which may affect absence or require support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Systems and data</h3>

<p>1. Use clear and consistently applied systems and processes to improve, reward and incentivise attendance and address absences. Make sure these systems are inclusive and appropriate for all pupils.</p>

<p>2. Make sure escalation procedures to address absence are initiated proactively, understood by pupils and families, implemented consistently and their impact reviewed regularly.</p>

<p>3. Every member of staff should know and understand their responsibilities for attendance.</p>

<p>4. Robust school systems provide useful data at cohort, group and individual pupil level to give an accurate view of attendance, reasons for absence and patterns amongst groups such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>children who have a social worker including looked-after children</li>
  <li>young carers</li>
  <li>children who are eligible for free school meals</li>
  <li>children who speak English as a second language</li>
  <li>children who have special educational needs and disabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Monitor and analyse attendance data regularly to allow early intervention to address issues. This includes raising concerns with other agencies like children’s social care and early help services which are working with families.</p>

<p>6. Attendance leaders may consider providing regular reports to staff across the school to enable them to track the attendance of pupils and to implement attendance procedures.</p>

<p>7. School attendance, safeguarding and pastoral support policies should clearly outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the key principles</li>
  <li>rules pupils need to follow</li>
  <li>routines</li>
  <li>consequence systems</li>
</ul>

<p>8. The escalation of procedures to address absence needs to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understood by pupils, parents and carers</li>
  <li>implemented consistently</li>
  <li>reviewed regularly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Intervention</h3>

<p>1. Deliver intervention in a targeted way, in response to data or intelligence.</p>

<p>2. Monitor and analyse attendance data regularly to ensure that intervention is delivered quickly to address absence (register inspections, code analysis, cohort and group monitoring, punctuality, lesson attendance across subjects and benchmarking).</p>

<p>3. Use attendance, pastoral and <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> staff who are skilled in supporting pupils and their families to identify and overcome barriers to attendance.</p>

<p>4. Create action plans in partnership with families and other agencies that may be supporting families, for example, children’s social care and early help services. Commission or deliver interventions to improve attendance.</p>

<p>5. Monitor the impact of any intervention, making adjustments if necessary and using findings to inform future strategy.</p>

<p>6. Where interventions fail to address attendance issues, identify the reasons why and, where appropriate, change or adjust the intervention.</p>

<p>7. Follow local authority codes of conduct, policies and procedures and make referrals for statutory intervention when interventions have not resulted in improved attendance and relevant triggers / thresholds are met.</p>

<h2>Actions for school staff and local authorities to improve attendance</h2>

<p>The following sections outline the actions that school staff and local authorities could consider taking to improve attendance for all pupils, pupils at risk of poor attendance and pupils who are persistently absent. You might have different staffing structures and policies, so the designated staff we have used as examples below may not be an exact match. However, the actions we are recommending are relevant to all settings.</p>

  <li>monitor the attendance of looked-after children</li>
  <li>set aspirational targets for attendance within personal education plans</li>
  <li>provide training for designated teachers about their role in promoting the attendance of looked-after and previously looked-after children</li>
  <li>provide advice and guidance to those services supporting previously looked-after children and their families about promoting and securing good attendance</li>
</ul>

<p>School nursing teams may provide support to help implement care plans to support the attendance of pupils with healthcare needs.</p>

<h4>Pupils at risk of persistent absence</h4>

<p>Local authorities may want to have a clear process for how attendance issues should be managed and escalated if unresolved, making clear when to follow different steps of intervention and involving all relevant agencies.</p>

<p>Social workers and family support workers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>convey high expectations for attendance</li>
  <li>make sure school attendance is prioritised within multi-agency plans</li>
  <li>in line with local guidance, use children in need or other multi-agency plans to identify barriers to attendance and engage schools and services in providing early intervention support</li>
</ul>

<p>For looked-after children, Virtual School Heads should ensure personal education plans identify and address any barriers to good attendance.</p>

<h4>Pupils who are persistently absent</h4>

<p>Local authorities may want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider using the full range of Parental Responsibility Measures (including fast track, parenting contracts and parenting orders, education supervision orders, penalty notices, and ultimately prosecution) using supportive measures alongside sanctions to change parental behaviour</li>
  <li>build relationships with families of persistently absent pupils, and provide practical support to unblock barriers to attendance</li>
  <li>coordinate strategies and services to ensure that messages on attendance are consistent and that information is shared appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Social workers and family support workers should convey expectations for attendance and support children and families to overcome barriers to attendance</p>

<p>For looked-after children, Virtual School Heads should use personal education plans to identify barriers to attendance and secure appropriate intervention, reviewing regularly to monitor impact.</p>

<p>To help pupils return to school, school nursing teams can also provide support and advice on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attendance routines</li>
  <li>hospital education provision</li>
  <li>home tuition</li>
  <li>medical needs provision</li>
</ul>
