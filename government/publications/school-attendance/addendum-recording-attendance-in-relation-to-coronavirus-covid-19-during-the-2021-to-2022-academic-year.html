<h2>Purpose of this document</h2>

<p>This publication is an addendum to the non-statutory <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-attendance">school attendance: guidance for schools</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance sets out how schools should record pupils who are not in school for reasons related to coronavirus (COVID-19) in the register.</p>

<h3>Expiry or review date</h3>

<p>This guidance will be reviewed before August 2022.</p>

<h3>Who is this publication for?</h3>

<p>This guidance is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school leaders, school staff and governing bodies in all maintained schools, academies, independent, and free schools</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This guidance sets out how schools should record where pupils are not attending school for reasons related to coronavirus in the 2021/22 academic year. <b>Schools are no longer advised to record pupils who are not attending school for reasons related to coronavirus using Code X (not attending in circumstances related coronavirus).</b></p>

<h2>Attendance Expectations</h2>

<p>Attendance is mandatory. The usual rules on attendance continue to apply, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parents’ duty to ensure that their child of compulsory school age attends regularly at the school where the child is a registered pupil</li>
  <li>schools’ responsibilities to record attendance and follow up absence</li>
  <li>the ability to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices, in line with local authorities’ codes of conduct</li>
  <li>the duty on local authorities to put in place arrangements for identifying, and to follow up with, children missing education</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not attending in circumstances relating to COVID-19</h2>

<p>In line with our transition to living with COVID-19, we no longer advise schools to record pupils who do not attend for reasons related to COVID-19 using Code X. Pupils with symptoms of COVID-19 are no longer advised to get a test, and most of the scenarios that this category was brought in to record no longer apply.</p>

<h3>Pupils who have symptoms or a positive test for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Pupils who have symptoms of COVID-19 should follow the latest government guidance about when they should stay at home.</p>

<p>Where a pupil is not attending because they have symptoms of COVID-19 or have had a positive test, schools should record this using Code I (illness) unless another more appropriate code applies.</p>

<p>Schools may continue to use the sub-code (I02) to record illness due to suspected COVID-19 although they are not required to.</p>

<p>Schools should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emergency-planning-and-response-for-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings">department’s emergency planning guidance</a> and the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> guidance</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Remote education</h2>

<p>Schools and colleges should continue to provide remote education to allow children and young people, who are well enough to learn, to keep pace with their education when in-person attendance in school or college is either not possible or contrary to government guidance.</p>

<p>Schools should keep a record of, and monitor engagement with, this activity, but this does not need to be tracked in the attendance register.</p>
