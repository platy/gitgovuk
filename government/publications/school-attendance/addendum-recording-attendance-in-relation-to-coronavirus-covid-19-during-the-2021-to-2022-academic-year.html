<h2>Purpose of this document</h2>

<p>This publication is an addendum to the non-statutory <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-attendance" class="govuk-link">school attendance: guidance for schools</a>.</p>

<p>We have amended regulations to enable schools, in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, to continue to record where a pupil does not attend in circumstances relating to COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Expiry or review date</h3>

<p>This guidance will be reviewed before August 2022.</p>

<h3>Who is this publication for?</h3>

<p>This guidance is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school leaders, school staff and governing bodies in all maintained schools, academies, independent, and free schools</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This guidance sets out how schools should record where pupils are not attending in circumstances related to coronavirus in the 2021/22 academic year. This category should only be used to record where their attendance would be contrary to legislation or guidance relating to the incidence or transmission of COVID-19 from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>), or its successor body the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, or the Department for Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Attendance expectations</h3>

<p>Attendance is mandatory. The usual rules on attendance continue to apply, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>parents’ duty to ensure that their child of compulsory school age attends regularly at the school where the child is a registered pupil</li>
  <li>schools’ responsibilities to record attendance and follow up absence</li>
  <li>the ability to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices, in line with local authorities’ codes of conduct</li>
  <li>the duty on local authorities to put in place arrangements for identifying, and to follow up with, children missing education</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not attending in circumstances relating to COVID-19</h2>

<p>This category must be used to record sessions that take place in the 2021 to 2022 academic year where a pupil does not attend because their travel to, or attendance at, school would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contrary to guidance relating to the incidence or transmission of COVID-19 from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>), or its successor UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>), and/or the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>prohibited by any legislation (or instruments such as statutory directions) relating to the incidence or transmission of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>This category must only be used to record where a pupil is not attending for the reasons set out above. It should not be used to record any other type of non-attendance or absence - for example, where a parent or pupil is anxious about attending school because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/schools-covid-19-operational-guidance">schools COVID-19 operational guidance</a> sets out when pupils should self-isolate and when they ought to be tested in the 2021 to 2022 academic year.</p>

<h2>Examples in which ‘not attending in circumstances relating to COVID-19’ could apply</h2>

<p>In line with current legislation, and guidance from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> (and its successor the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, examples are as follows.</p>

<h3>Pupils who are required to self-isolate as they have symptoms or confirmed COVID-19</h3>

<p>Pupils who have symptoms of COVID-19, or have had a positive lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) test, should self-isolate and get a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test.</p>

<p>If a pupil tests negative and if they feel well, they can stop self-isolating and return to school. If the pupil remains unwell following the test (such as with a different illness), then they should be recorded as code I (illness). Code X should only be used up until the time of the negative test result. Schools should not retrospectively change the attendance register due to a negative test result.</p>

<p>If a pupil tests positive, they should continue to self-isolate in line with public health guidance. Code X should be used for the period of self-isolation until the test. After the pupil tests positive, they should be recorded as code I (illness) until they are able to return to school.</p>

<h3>Pupils who are a close contact of someone who has symptoms or confirmed COVID-19</h3>

<p>Pupils who have been identified as a close contact of a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, irrespective of vaccination status and age, will be contacted directly, required to self-isolate immediately and asked to book a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>. They will be informed by the local health protection team or NHS Test and Trace if they fall into this category and provided with details about self-isolation.</p>

<p>Pupils are not required to self-isolate if they live in the same household as someone with COVID-19 who is not a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, or are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 who is not a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant, and any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>they are below the age of 18 years and 6 months</li>
  <li>they have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial</li>
  <li>they are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pupils who are required by legislation to self-isolate as part of a period of quarantine</h3>

<p>As usual, parents should plan their holidays within school breaks and avoid seeking permission to take their children out of school during term time. Families should also consider that their child may need to self-isolate following trips overseas that require a period of quarantine. If a pupil is required to be in quarantine on arrival in, or return to, the UK, the school should use code X in the register.</p>

<h3>Pupils who are self-isolating but who have not had a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h3>

<p>In line with public health advice, pupils with symptoms must self-isolate and schools should strongly encourage pupils to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Where the pupil is unable to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the school should record the pupil as code X in the register.</p>

<p>Schools should follow up with families if they are not satisfied with the reason as to why the pupil is not in school. Schools can request supporting evidence from the family. Where the school is not satisfied with the reason given for absence, they may record this using one of the unauthorised absence codes, in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-attendance" class="govuk-link">school attendance: guidance for schools</a>.</p>

<h2>Remote education</h2>

<p>If a pupil is not attending school because their attendance would be contrary to government guidance or legislation around COVID-19, we expect schools to offer them access to remote education. Schools should keep a record of, and monitor engagement with, this activity, but this does not need to be tracked in the attendance register.</p>
