<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Background</h2>

<p>3.1. Claims can be made under this instruction for Beneficiaries who have arrived in the UK under the schemes stated at paragraphs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, plus Eligible British Nationals.</p>

<p>3.1.1 The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), which will prioritise those who have assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan and stood up for values such as democracy, women’s rights and freedom of speech, the rule of law; and vulnerable people, including women and girls at risk, and members of minority groups at risk. This scheme will resettle up to 20,000 people at risk. Spouses, partners, and dependent children under the age of 18 of identified eligible individuals will be eligible for the scheme. Other family members may be eligible in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>3.1.2 The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), which went live on 1 April 2021, offers relocation or other assistance to those who served alongside our armed forces in Afghanistan and provided important support to Her Majesty’s Government defence and security mission there, predominantly those who were employed directly, or in certain special cases via contractors, and who are assessed to be at serious risk as a result of such work. It is available to people regardless of rank or role, or length of time served, and builds on the long-standing support already available. The policy provides for the principal applicant to bring their close family members (spouse and under 18 children) to the UK and significantly expands the eligibility criteria from the previous scheme. Other family members may be eligible in exceptional circumstances. Claims under this instruction can only be made for Beneficiaries who started receiving support from a Recipient on or after 22 June 2021.</p>

<p>3.2. To further support these commitments, the Community Sponsorship Scheme has been developed enabling Sponsors to provide comprehensive wrap-around support to those resettled to the UK under the ACRS for a period of two (2) years.</p>

<p>3.3. The Schemes’ primary purpose is to resettle Beneficiaries in a way that;</p>

<p>3.3.1 Secures national security and public protection, and</p>

<p>3.3.2 Has the wellbeing of the vulnerable persons and the welcoming communities at the centre of decision making, and</p>

<p>3.3.3 Delivers value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>4.1. Participating local and regional authorities have made commitments to provide support for Beneficiaries for up to thirty-six (36) Months after their first arrival in the Recipient’s area, through the provision of initial reception arrangements, and access to accommodation, casework support, education (incl. language skills), healthcare, and social care.</p>

<p>4.2. This Instruction sets out the terms under which the Authority will make Funding, as described at Clause 7.2, available to participating Recipients in the United Kingdom (principally, but not exclusively, Clinical Commissioning Groups or any successor organisations) in respect of Eligible Expenditure incurred supporting Beneficiaries brought to the United Kingdom under The Schemes for the period 01 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 The document should be read in conjunction with the relevant Medical Costs Workbook (the ‘Workbook’) at Annex A.</p>

<p>4.3. The Recipient must be able to demonstrate to the Authority that for every Beneficiary, the outcomes described in Annex B have been achieved.

<p>7.2. Payment for each Beneficiary supported by a Recipient will be at a standard Funding (per capita) rate<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> set by the Authority.</p>

<p>7.3. The Funding (per capita) shall be £2,600 (two thousand six hundred pounds) per capita intended to cover:</p>

<p>7.3.1 initial registration with health professionals and initial Primary Healthcare costs (at a cost of £600 per person), and</p>

<p>7.3.2 some initial Secondary Healthcare costs (at a cost of £2,000 per person).</p>

<p>7.4. The Funding (per capita) will be aggregated on the basis of family groups, forming a pooled fund from which the Recipient can draw as required according to a Beneficiary’s needs i.e. Funding (per capita) for each family group will be aggregated and used to cover the healthcare costs of each family member as required.

<p>7.5. To receive the Funding (per capita) the Recipient needs to provide the Authority with the Group Number (ARAP or ACRS) as suitable evidence that Beneficiaries for whom a claim is to be made have registered with appropriate health providers. This evidence will consist of an accurately completed Medical Costs Workbook to support the Recipient’s quarterly claim for arrivals. The Authority will not request any further evidence from the Recipient of how the Funding (per capita) has been committed. Where the Recipient commissions services from other providers, such as NHS England, they will make appropriate arrangements to reimburse those providers from the Funding provided by the Authority.</p>

<p>7.6. The Recipient can submit an application for Funding (additional) where any additional Secondary Healthcare treatment is carried out at any point during the first twelve (12) months following the Beneficiary’s arrival in the Recipient’s area and the pooled fund is, or may reasonably be expected shortly to be, exhausted.

<h2>Annex C – UNHCR Resettlement Submission Categories</h2>

<p>The Authority is responsible for identifying suitable Refugees for resettlement to the UK under the UK Resettlement Scheme in liaison with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) based upon the following seven resettlement submission categories<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal and or Physical Protection Needs</li>
  <li>Survivors of Torture and/or Violence</li>
  <li>Medical Needs</li>
  <li>Women and Girls at Risk</li>
  <li>Family Reunification</li>
  <li>Children and Adolescents at Risk (see below)</li>
  <li>Lack of Foreseeable Alternative Durable Solutions</li>
</ul>

<h3>UNHCR’s Categories of Children and Adolescents at Risk</h3>

<h4>Unaccompanied children (UAC):</h4>

<p>are those children who have been separated from both parents and other relatives and are not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.</p>

<h4>Separated children (SC):</h4>

<p>are those separated from both parents, or from their previous legal or customary primary caregiver, but not necessarily from other relatives. These may, therefore, include children accompanied by other adult family members.</p>

<h4>Children without legal documentation:</h4>

<p>This would include children without legal documentation to prove their legal identity, and who may be particularly vulnerable and considered for resettlement, including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>children aged 0-4 years who lack evidence of their birth (no birth certificate, no birth notification passport or family booklet), and where one parent is not present (in particular, where the parent who has the right to pass nationality is not present), or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children aged 12-17 who lack documentation to prove their age and who face other protection risks (child labour, child marriage, child recruitment, children detained or in conflict with the law) who are at particular risk because they lack proof of their status as children and are therefore unable to prove their right to age-specific child protections under the law.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Children with specific medical needs:</h4>

<p>Child with serious medical condition is a person below the age of 18 that requires assistance, in terms of treatment or provision of nutritional and non-food items, in the country of asylum.</p>

<h4>Children with disabilities:</h4>

<p>A child with disability is a person below the age of 18 who has physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments from birth, or resulting from illness, infection, injury, or trauma. These may hinder full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.</p>

<h4>Child carers:</h4>

<p>The Child Carer category includes a person below the age of 18, who is not an unaccompanied child and who has assumed responsibility as head of household. This could include, for example, a child who still lives with his/her parents, but has taken on the role of caring for them (and possible siblings) due to the fact that the parents are ill, disabled, etc.</p>

<h4>Children at risk of harmful traditional practices, including child marriage and female genital mutilation:</h4>

<p>Person below the age of 18 years of age who is at risk of, or is a victim/ survivor of a harmful traditional practice. Every social grouping has specific traditional practices and beliefs, some of which are beneficial to all members while others are harmful to a specific group, such as women. Such harmful traditional practices include for instance, female genital mutilation, early marriage, dowry price, widow inheritance, female force feeding, witch hunting, female infanticide, son preference and its implications for the girl child.

<h2>Annex D – Data Sharing Protocol</h2>

<p>1.1. The aim of this DSP is to provide a set of principles for information sharing between the Authority and the Recipient.</p>

<p>1.2. This DSP sets out the rules that the Recipient must follow when handling information classified as “personal data” by UK Data Protection Legislation in force. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Data Protection Legislation</h3>

<p>2.1. The UK Data Protection Legislation stipulates specific obligations upon all individuals who process personal data which must be adhered to. The UK Data Protection Legislation requires that all transfers of information fall within its six data protection principles. The Recipient, when processing personal data in connection with the Instruction, must comply with these principles of good practice.</p>

<p>2.2. Personal data must be processed in accordance with the following six data protection principles:</p>

<p>2.2.1 Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;</p>

<p>2.2.2 Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;</p>

<p>2.2.3 Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;</p>

<p>2.2.4 Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;</p>

<p>2.2.5 Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the UK GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and</p>

<p>2.2.6 Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Security</h3>

<p>3.1. The Recipient and its Staff shall exercise care in the use of information that they acquire in the course of their official role, and to protect information which is held by them in accordance with the UK Data Protection Legislation. Such measures include;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Not discussing information about a Beneficiary in public; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not disclosing information to parties who are not authorised to have access to the shared information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.2. In addition to the above, the Recipient must ensure that;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Personal data received is processed solely for the purposes of discharging their obligations for supporting Beneficiaries under this Instruction;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All personal data received is stored securely;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only people who have a genuine need to see the data will have access to it;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Information is only retained while there is a need to keep it, and destroyed in line with government guidelines;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All reasonable efforts have been taken to warrant that the Recipient does not commit a personal data breach;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any information losses, wrongful disclosures or personal data breaches originating from the Authority are reported to the Authority’s Security team at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HOSecurity-DataIncidents@homeoffice.gov.uk">HOSecurity-DataIncidents@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authorities, Security Team and Data Protection Officer will provide direction on the appropriate steps to take e.g. notification of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) or dissemination of any information to the Beneficiaries;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility to notify the Authority is not withstanding any internal policies the Recipients may have regarding reporting data breaches to the ICO.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.3. Security breaches and incidents can result in government information being made available to those not authorised to have it or violate confidentiality. In the worst cases, a security incident or breach can jeopardise national security or endanger the safety of the public.</p>

<p>3.4. The Authority will make available further information as to what constitutes a personal data breach upon request.</p>

<p>3.5. As public-sector bodies the Authority and the Recipient are required to process personal data in line with Her Majesty’s Government Security Policy Framework (HMG SPF) guidance issued by the Cabinet Office when handling, transferring, storing, accessing or destroying information assets.</p>
