<h2>Schedule 2: Post-arrival temporary accommodation &amp; relocation support</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 The Authority will provide funding to local authorities to manage increases in the number of homeless applications following the introduction of an enhanced end-to-end process for matching beneficiaries to settled accommodation and to reduce the growing number of refusals of accommodation. This is being implemented from 9 May 2022.</p>

<p>1.2 Beneficiaries will be offered a maximum of two appropriate accommodation offers. If a beneficiary rejects two appropriate offers, without what is assessed to be a “good reason”, the Home Office will give a minimum of 56 days’ notice for the beneficiaries to leave the bridging hotel.</p>

<p>1.3 The beneficiary should either seek to make their own accommodation arrangements during the notice period or consent to a referral to a local authority (on behalf of the Authority, as agreed in regional homelessness referral plans) for assessment of duties owed to them if homeless. At the end of the notice period bridging accommodation will be withdrawn, and the family/individual will need to leave the bridging hotel.</p>

<p>1.4 Local authorities providing temporary accommodation to beneficiaries as part of homelessness duties will be funded for up to six months; and integration support, the same as that received in bridging accommodation, will be funded up to three months.</p>

<p>1.5 These time-limited temporary accommodation funding arrangements are intended to reduce new pressures on already stretched homelessness services, encourage reduced prolonged use of temporary accommodation where possible, and support integration outcomes.</p>

<p>1.6 This funding will be kept under review to ensure it is effective and proportionate.</p>

<h3>Statement of outcomes</h3>

<p>1.7 The Recipient will provide temporary accommodation and integration support for Beneficiaries where they have accepted a homelessness duty (further details on funding below). Please refer to Integration Support Funding Instruction, Schedule 1, Statement of Outcomes for expectations of integration support.</p>

<p>1.7.1 The Recipient will also seek to arrange settled accommodation for those Beneficiaries they are supporting under homelessness duties which:</p>

<p>1.7.2 meet local authority standards, and</p>

<p>1.7.3 will be available as soon as possible after their arrival/or relocation to the local authority area, and</p>

<p>1.7.4 is affordable and sustainable.</p>

<p>1.8 The Recipient will ensure that the accommodation is furnished appropriately. Funding received should be used for food storage, cooking, and washing facilities but should not include the provision of other white goods or brown goods, i.e., TVs, DVD players or any other electrical entertainment appliances. This shall not preclude the Recipient from providing Beneficiaries with additional luxury, white or brown goods through other sources of funding.</p>

<p>1.9 The Recipient shall ensure that the Beneficiaries are registered with utility companies and ensure that arrangements for payments are put in place (no pre-pay coin or card meters accounts).</p>

<p>1.10 The Recipient will provide briefings on the accommodation and health and safety issues for all new arrivals including the provision of an emergency contact point.</p>

<h3>How to claim</h3>

<p>1.11 Local Authorities can claim Funding for accepting homelessness duties and for up to 6 months of temporary accommodation, support, and associated administration.</p>

<h4>Fixed tariffs</h4>

<p>1.12 Local authorities will be able to claim a fixed sum of £2,000 per household for staff and administration costs for assessing and accepting a homelessness duty, and the first 2 months of providing Temporary Accommodation.</p>

<p>1.13 If applicable, for households receiving accommodation and support at 3-6 months since homelessness has been established (inclusive), local authorities will be able to claim £80 per week per household to cover additional Temporary Accommodation and related support and staff costs only (as the application will have been completed), capped at a maximum of 16 weeks.</p>

<p>1.14 The total amount a local authority can claim and receive for an accepted homelessness duty and temporary accommodation for one household is £3,280 over 6 months.</p>

<p>1.15 If a local authority provides settled accommodation to a household within the first 2 months of accepting a homelessness duty, they will be able to claim the £2,000 fixed sum, to cover their costs of administering the homeless application.</p>

<p>1.16 Claims for up to 6 months of Temporary Accommodation (and 3 months of associated integration support – see below) should be made by one local authority even if beneficiaries need to be placed in Temporary Accommodation in an area outside the Local Authority that accepted the homelessness duty. In this scenario, the local authority where the duty is accepted should make the claims and would agree to any necessary reimbursement bilaterally with the other council, rather than Temporary Accommodation claims being made by multiple local authorities for the same household. If possible, no household should move from one Temporary Accommodation location to another (in order to maintain integration outcomes).</p>

<h4>Funding for 3 months of integration support</h4>

<p>1.17 Local authorities can claim £28 per person per day wrap-around funding so that beneficiaries can access integration support in the Temporary Accommodation area. This Temporary Accommodation integration support should include, as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>support (and set-up in new areas) to access mainstream services (inc. health, education, employment) and safeguarding;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>move-on casework support;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>formal and/or informal ESOL support (English for Speakers of Other Languages).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.18 This Temporary Accommodation integration funding is time limited for up to a maximum of 3 months, with local authority’s claims based on the actual time beneficiaries spend in Temporary Accommodation.</p>

<p>1.19 Claims should be made using the relevant Exceptional costs claim form, which will be sent to Recipients.</p>

<h2>Annex B – Data sharing protocol (DSP)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Aims and objectives of the DSP</h3>

<p>1.1 The aim of this DSP is to provide a set of principles for information sharing.</p>

<p>1.2 This DSP sets out the rules that the Recipient must follow when handling information classified as “personal data” by UK Data Protection Legislation in force.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Data Protection Legislation</h3>

<p>2.1 The UK Data Protection Legislation stipulates specific obligations upon all individuals who process personal data which must be adhered to. The UK Data Protection Legislation requires that all transfers of information fall within its six data protection principles. The Recipient, when processing personal data in connection with the Instruction, must comply with these principles of good practice.</p>

<p>2.2 Personal data must be processed in accordance with the following six data protection principles:</p>

<p>(i) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;</p>

<p>(ii) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;</p>

<p>(iii) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;</p>

<p>(iv) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased, or rectified without delay;</p>

<p>(v) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the UK GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and,</p>

<p>(vi) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Security</h3>

<p>3.1 The Recipient and its Staff shall exercise care in the use of information that they acquire in the course of their official role, and to protect information which is held by them in accordance with the UK Data Protection Legislation. Such measures include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not discussing information about a Beneficiary in public; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not disclosing information to parties who are not authorised to have access to the shared information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.2      In addition to the above, the Recipient must ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>personal data received is processed solely for the purposes of discharging their obligations for supporting Beneficiaries under this Instruction,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all personal data received is stored securely,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only people who have a genuine need to see the data will have access to it,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information is only retained while there is a need to keep it, and destroyed in line with government guidelines,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all reasonable efforts have been taken to warrant that the Recipient does not commit a personal data breach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any information losses, wrongful disclosures or personal data breaches originating from the Authority are reported to the Authority’s Security team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HOSecurity-DataIncidents@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk">HOSecurity-DataIncidents@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Authorities, Security Team and Data Protection Officer will provide direction on the appropriate steps to take e.g. notification of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) or dissemination of any information to the Beneficiaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsibility to notify the HO is not withstanding the internal policies SMPs, and local authorities will have regarding reporting data breaches to the ICO in their role as data controller in accordance with 5.6 above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security breaches and incidents can result in government information being made available to those not authorised to have it or violate confidentiality. In the worst cases, a security incident or breach can jeopardise national security or endanger the safety of the public.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.3 Security breaches and incidents can result in government information being made available to those not authorised to have it or violate confidentiality. In the worst cases, a security incident or breach can jeopardise national security or endanger the safety of the public.</p>

<p>3.4 The Authority will make available further information as to what constitutes a personal data breach upon request.</p>

<h2>Annex D – Roles and responsibilities for Local Authority Wraparound staff, and Home Office teams</h2>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities split: Council wraparound staff and Home Office teams (HOLOs and Local Authority Engagement)</h3>

<p>The following information sets out the default role split between councils (or council-commissioned VCS staff) and Home Office teams (Home Office Liaison Officers and the Home Office Local Authority Engagement team) which will be formalised through the forthcoming funding instruction updates made in summer 2022. Council wraparound staff and HOLOs should feel free to collaboratively adjust this default position if helpful for local delivery.</p>

<h4>Council wraparound staff (£28pppd)</h4>

<h5>Summary of role:</h5>

<p>The council wraparound staff funded by £28pppd (and any voluntary and community sector organisations commissioned by councils to deliver this role) are responsible for having conversations with hotel guests to help them navigate the challenges and opportunities of moving to settled accommodation and communities. These conversations will help guests better understand public and private settings/systems in the UK, including housing, employment, education, household planning, health and being an active member of local communities.</p>

<p>The wraparound staff are responsible for making homelessness referrals when families/individuals refuse two appropriate offers of settled accommodation without good reason.</p>

<p>The wraparound staff work closely with HOLOs to ensure that their holistic conversations compliment the HOLOs’ parallel conversations with families/individuals around property offer next steps (see HOLO section).</p>

<h5>Key components of the role:</h5>

<h6>1. Creating the conditions for families/individuals to progress (‘move-on’) to settled accommodation and communities</h6>

<p>a) 1:1 ‘move-on’ conversations. Hold 1:1 or family conversations as early as possible to understand the aims, skills, needs/preferences of the adults and children; and complete a ‘move-on plan’, either using the template provided by Government (see Annex) or adapting existing local approaches.</p>

<p>Note: these conversations are not intended to replace or duplicate HOLO triage or offer conversations; however, if details useful to property matching arise here and are not already covered within the triage process then wraparound staff should share this with HOLOs.</p>

<p>Wraparound staff should give useful guidance to residents in seeking their own accommodation in the private rented sector including working with single guests to help them build a network which could see them moving into a house of multiple occupancy, which may be more readily available than one bedroomed accommodation.</p>

<p>‘Move-on’ conversations and plans should consider and seek to address the specific needs of and potential barriers to individuals and families progressing to settled accommodation. Barriers could include understanding of the housing context, mental health and English language. Councils wherever possible should seek to engage both men and women in ‘move-on’ conversations and support.</p>

<p>b) Information-sharing &amp; myth-busting. Provide information and support to enable guests to (i) make informed decisions about moving on to settled accommodation and to enable them to (ii) settle successfully into being tenants and accessing services in new communities. As part of proactive move-on conversations, and where questions arise reactively, wraparound staff should provide accessible information and actively ‘myth-bust’ inaccurate expectations to ensure individuals/families are able to make informed decisions and they understand the wider rationale for property offers being made in specific areas of the country. (Note: myth-busting materials will be provided by Government in parallel to support this.) For example, provide information around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Size/quality of UK housing in general; specific myths around certain locations to ensure households are considering options outside of major cities; landlord relationship in private rented sector; home ownership; access to social housing.</li>
  <li>Responsibilities for payment of Council Tax, insurance, utility bills, food and rent payments.</li>
  <li>Financial position, eligibility, and opportunities for housing in the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rate (via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/" rel="external">https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/</a>).</li>
  <li>Jobs markets and competition for certain roles.</li>
  <li>Public service provision e.g. Availability of school places, health places etc.)</li>
  <li>Transport, inc. that many people are required to travel some distance to work, education, shops, and places of worship.</li>
  <li>Maps of the UK and help downloading relevant apps to provide clarity on times and distances to families, employment, and amenities.</li>
  <li>Work with DWP to provide ‘better off calculations’ and clarify financial position (and requirement to find employment).</li>
  <li>Support guests to accept a matched property offer, by reiterating HOLO messaging (see HOLO section).</li>
  <li>Help guests understand the role of the council once they move into settled accommodation.</li>
</ul>

<p>c) ‘Find Your Own’ PRS. Support guests to source their own private rented sector (PRS) property if they wish to.</p>

<p>Wraparound staff responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discussing affordability with household;</li>
  <li>Encouraging household to do property searches;</li>
  <li>Establishing links with prospective/new receiving council;</li>
  <li>Liaising with receiving council to give clear steer whether they can provide integration support to empower family to decide whether to choose a particular prs property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: receiving council will: check if property is appropriate; liaise with prospective landlord, determine deposit/rent financial support; welcome the new residents; and give notification of successful move-in.</p>

<p>d) Inter-council information sharing. Wraparound staff will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facilitate the transition of families across councils by sharing key information (including number of family members, gender, age, education levels, mental health issues, past experiences etc.) between councils and relevant statutory services.</li>
  <li>Facilitate conversations with the ‘receiving’ council where more information about a property/area is needed/requested by a family.</li>
  <li>Ensure continuity of support and that there is sufficient handover in place to support the transition of families and individuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: transport for all moves from hotels to settled accommodation is currently organised by the Home Office; however, this is subject to review and any changes will be confirmed to councils.</p>

<h6>2) Ensure new arrivals in bridging accommodation are welcomed/oriented and receive initial integration support.</h6>

<p>a) Welcome, orientation &amp; integration. To date, the funding instructions and wraparound support has in many cases focused primarily on welcoming arrivals and providing support to enable them to integrate into the UK. Although (as above) councils will now be encouraged to prioritise resource to support households to move on to settled accommodation, providing integration support remains important in general and as a part of enabling guests to move on to settled accommodation and settle into new communities, access jobs and services. Councils should provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mental health support signposting</li>
  <li>Ensure safeguarding, including working with relevant social services staff</li>
  <li>Support people with greater barriers to integration, including women</li>
  <li>Signposting to job centres and local DWP staff.</li>
  <li>Deliver ESOL support, including informal and/or formal training, to guests in hotels to support integration</li>
  <li>Continue to support new arrivals to access mainstream services including health, education, benefits, and employment services</li>
  <li>Facilitate social interaction amongst guests.</li>
</ul>

<h6>3) Deliver a case-worker role to facilitate homeless referrals on behalf of the Home Office for those that have refused two appropriate offers</h6>

<p>a) Case-worker role. Where the Home Office have issued notice to a family/individual to end their placement in bridging accommodation due to refusal of two appropriate offers of settled accommodation (without good reason), the council must provide a caseworker who will determine if the household have alternative accommodation available to them or may become homeless at the point of eviction. The caseworker must coordinate with the HOLO once notice has been served to a household. The caseworker will then deliver the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consent to referral. If the household are likely to be made homeless, the caseworker should – on behalf of the Home Office – obtain the household’s consent to a referral being made to a council for assessment of duties owed to them if homeless.</li>
  <li>Referral to appropriate council. Once consent has been obtained, the caseworker should refer the household to a council for a homelessness application in the following order of priority (further details will be provided separately):
    <ul>
      <li>Local connection (as defined in homelessness legislation and guidance)</li>
      <li>Council where second appropriate offer was made</li>
      <li>According to the agreed regional homelessness referral plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inter-council communication. Liaise with the receiving council on the progress of the household’s application and coordinate the household’s arrival at their accommodation.</li>
  <li>Update the Home Office. Councils will need to keep the Home Office matching team up to date with the progress of homelessness referrals, duties accepted and accommodation outcomes as households leave hotel accommodation (after refusing two property offers). This information will enable government to track referral outcomes at a household and cohort level, and in turn ensure the process can be adapted/improved according to emerging trends. The Home Office will request this information when a household begins the referral process, but the communication will necessarily continue as households move through the process. The Home Office will specifically ask for updates on the following areas:
    <ul>
      <li>which councils individuals/families were referred to, and whether the council accepted the duty;</li>
      <li>if accepted, did the individual/family proceed to settled accommodation or temporary accommodation;</li>
      <li>if not accepted, are the individual/family proceeding to alternative accommodation (e.g. friends/family); or are they at risk of rough sleeping (individuals only).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6>4) Integrate cross-cutting considerations into support for households</h6>

<p>a) Consideration of needs &amp; backgrounds. Throughout supporting individuals/families, consideration should be given to the varying needs and backgrounds of residents, including differences based on gender and protected characteristics more broadly. Individual needs within family units, for example, of women, should be considered as well as a family’s needs as a whole.</p>

<p>b) Interpreting. Ensure interpreting services are available where necessary.</p>

<p>c) Council commissioning. Councils can use funding to deliver support directly by council staff and/or other organisations including the VCS and statutory services staff.</p>

<p>d) Delivering in external settings. Where possible, wraparound staff should support families/individuals to access services in the places that council advice is delivered – such as council offices, libraries, community settings etc. This will improve integration outcomes and will also help ensure that councils do not automatically need to develop a separate offer for those in hotels.</p>

<h4>Home Office Liaison Officer (HOLO)</h4>

<h5>Summary of role:</h5>

<p>Home Office Liaison Officers (HOLOs) have responsibility for overseeing the operational functioning of, and associated stakeholder engagement, in the bridging hotels. They are contracted by the Home Office to accommodate people on the Afghan resettlement schemes.</p>

<p>The HOLOs are responsible for communicating official Government messaging to individuals/families, including about Home Office property offers and next steps.</p>

<p>The HOLOs work closely with the council wraparound staff to ensure that the HOLO engagement and property offer conversations compliment parallel conversations that the council wraparound staff are having with households about moving on to settled accommodation.</p>

<h5>Key components of the role:</h5>

<h6>1. Stakeholder engagement</h6>

<p>HOLOs manage stakeholder relationships and operational functions in hotels. HOLOs work with hotel personnel, councils, Government Departments, interpreters, and other stakeholders, as well as assisting in wellbeing, integration, and cultural events.</p>

<h6>2. Engagement surgeries</h6>

<p>HOLOs offer in-person and remote support to families/individuals, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Appointment-based surgeries to address queries ranging from Home Office case-related queries, general hotel / food standard issues, guest concerns and grievances.</li>
  <li>Distribute Government communications.</li>
  <li>HOLOs are the first point of contact to issue ASPEN cash cards and Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs).</li>
</ul>

<h6>3. Triage/information collection</h6>

<p>Triage and maintain accurate hotel occupancy data, including collecting data on needs and preferences of all guests in hotels in order to support effective matching to properties; and review every 4 weeks.</p>

<h6>4. Close working with wraparound staff</h6>

<p>HOLOs should meet regularly with wraparound staff to share intel and collaboratively problem-solve. As part of this, HOLOs should discuss the outcomes of triage exercises and homelessness referrals with relevant council staff, and record the outcomes in central systems.</p>

<h6>5. Matching</h6>

<p>HOLOs assist in the matching process by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holding discussions with families on specific property offers.</li>
  <li>Managing expectations e.g. that better properties are unlikely to be available and would be at best a similar size and quality; and that specific offers are the first step towards their longer-term plans in the UK, not the location they need to remain in for many years/decades to come.</li>
  <li>Act as a Home Office contact to families for accommodation moves.</li>
</ul>

<h6>6. Incidents</h6>

<p>HOLOs act as mediators to maintain positive multi-agency relations and will often lead unforeseen incident responses on the ground until it is resolved or referred on. e.g. incidents which require police intervention, or safeguarding referrals.</p>

<h6>7. Hotel closures</h6>

<p>When existing hotels are closed, HOLOs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run 1:1 sessions with guests, issue departure letters and manage expectations about new destinations.</li>
  <li>Feedback any safeguarding issues from the move</li>
  <li>Collate luggage information for transport requirements</li>
  <li>Collaborate with the hotels to manage logistics</li>
  <li>Confirm departure times to guests</li>
  <li>Ensure guests arrive safely in their receiving hotel and deal with any issues that may occur at receiving hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4>Home Office Local Authority Engagement Team</h4>

<h5>Summary of role:</h5>

<p>The Home Office Local Authority Engagement team are comprised of Bridging Hotel LA Engagement Officers and Contact Officers.</p>

<p>The Bridging Hotel LA Engagement Officers provide support to councils around the use of bridging hotels.</p>

<p>Contact Officers work to secure commitment to participate in resettlement schemes, secure property offers and support councils throughout the process of receiving families and with their long-term integration.</p>

<p>Each region has a dedicated LA Engagement Officer and Contact Officer.</p>

<h5>Key components of the role:</h5>

<h6>1. Bridging Hotel LA Engagement Officer role</h6>

<p>In relation to the ‘move-on’ process the LA Engagement Officer (sometimes referred to as “HOLA”) will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a regional single point of contact within the Home Office for councils and other internal and external stakeholders supporting residents of bridging hotels, including escalating any concerns such as safeguarding and behavioural issues.</li>
  <li>Develop and maintain positive relationships with councils and other external stakeholders to ensure appropriate accommodation is secured within the bridging hotel estate and escalate any concerns accordingly.</li>
  <li>Ensure appropriate Home Office-commissioned wraparound support is provided by councils and their partners.</li>
  <li>Facilitate dialogue with councils to commission and decommission hotels within the estate, and manage any concerns raised.</li>
</ul>

<h6>2. Contact Officer role</h6>

<p>In relation to the ‘move on’ process the Contact Officers will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Facilitate engagement with potential receiving councils where households wish to move to determine the level of integration support that may be available;</li>
      <li>Monitor property offers and accepted private accommodation offers against pledges from each council, ensuring they on track to deliver on their pledge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex: Guidance and Template for Home Office-commissioned bridging hotel wraparound staff to use to deliver 1:1 ‘move-on’ conversations with families/individuals on the Afghan resettlement schemes</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Councils with bridging hotels in their area have been commissioned by the Home Office to deliver hotel wraparound support to people on the Afghan resettlement schemes (and are reimbursed at a rate of £28 per person per day). Many councils will commission voluntary or community sector organisations to deliver this.</p>

<p>As part of this wraparound role, staff are expected to support people in hotels to progress effectively (‘move on’) to settled accommodation. The Home Office (via their Liaison Officers, HOLOs) will oversee and communicate Government-matched property offers to people on the schemes, so this is not included in the role of the wraparound staff (although they will want to integrate these developments into their wider conversations).</p>

<p>The wraparound staff’s focus should be on holistically building families/individuals’ knowledge, engagement and confidence around the wider resettlement and integration journey. This can include, but is not limited to, housing advice – and will encompass areas such as domestic budget management, the job market, education opportunities, community integration etc.</p>

<h3>Best practice for ‘move-on’ conversation</h3>

<p>As has been communicated to councils, the best practice when wraparound staff are having these conversations is as follows:</p>

<p>e) 1:1 ‘move-on’ conversations. Hold 1:1 or family conversations to understand the aims, skills, needs/preferences of the adults and children; and complete a ‘move-on plan’, either using the template provided by Government or adapting existing local approaches.</p>

<p>Note: these conversations are not intended to replace or duplicate HOLO triage conversations; however, if details useful to property matching arise here and are not already covered within the triage process then wraparound staff should share this with HOLOs.</p>

<p>Wraparound staff should give useful guidance to residents in seeking their own accommodation in the private rented sector including working with single guests to help them build a network which could see them moving into a house of multiple occupancy, which may be more readily available than one bedroomed accommodation.</p>

<p>‘Move-on’ conversations and plans should consider and seek to address the specific needs and potential barriers of individuals and families to progressing to settled accommodation. Barriers could include understanding of the housing context, mental health and English language. Councils, wherever possible, should seek to engage both men and women in ‘move-on’ conversations and support.</p>

<p>f) Information-sharing &amp; myth-busting. Provide information and support to enable guests to (i) make informed decisions about moving on to settled accommodation and to enable them to (ii) settle successfully into being tenants and accessing services in new communities. As part of proactive ‘move-on’ conversations, and where questions arise reactively, wraparound staff should provide accessible information and actively ‘myth-bust’ inaccurate expectations to ensure individuals/families are able to make informed decisions and they understand the wider rationale for property offers being made in specific areas of the country. For example, provide information around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>size/quality of UK housing; landlord relationship in private rented sector; home ownership; access to social housing.</li>
  <li>responsibilities for payment of Council Tax, insurance, utility bills, food and rent payments.</li>
  <li>financial position, eligibility and opportunities for housing in the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rate (via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/" rel="external">https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/</a>).</li>
  <li>jobs markets and availability.</li>
  <li>public service provision (e.g. availability of school places, health places etc).</li>
  <li>transport, including that many people are required to travel some distance to work, education, shops and places of worship.</li>
  <li>maps of the UK and help downloading relevant apps to provide clarity on times and distances to families, employment and amenities.</li>
  <li>work with DWP to provide ‘better off calculations’ and clarify financial position (and requirement to find employment).</li>
  <li>support guests to accept a matched property offer, by reiterating HOLO messaging (see HOLO section).</li>
  <li>help guests understand the role of the council once they move into settled accommodation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to use the Template below</h3>

<p>The Template below is intended to support these move-on conversations. To make them as effective as possible we suggest:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensuring that wraparound staff have received and read the Home Office triage information for the family/individual so that these personal circumstances and needs can be factored into advice and plans that are drawn up.</li>
  <li>Using the Template as a guide to prompt active engagement with a wide range of topics (as detailed above) which will aid the family/individuals’ longer-term integration in whichever community they settle in.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that the family/individual has a copy of their Home Office triage information and the ‘move-on’ plan that has been agreed between the wraparound staff and themselves, so that they can refer to it and iterate it as they progress on their resettlement journey.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Your personal ‘move-on’ plan</h3>

<h4>Introduction for families/individuals on the Afghan resettlement schemes</h4>

<p>Dear xxxx</p>

<p>As a current resident of a bridging hotel, you will be supported by hotel wraparound staff on behalf of the Home Office and Home Office Liaison Officers to build your knowledge on a wide range of topics which will help your integration once you move into settled accommodation. This will be written down in this personal ‘move-on’ plan to help you understand and keep track of what you discuss with the wraparound staff.</p>

<p>During your time in the hotel, you will be made an appropriate offer of settled accommodation by the Home Office. Your personal ‘move-on’ plan does not have an impact on this offer but is intended to give you the skills and knowledge to settle in better once you do accept the Home Office offer (it will have similar benefits if you find your own private rented sector property).</p>

<p>The ‘move-on’ plan is split into two sections: the first is a reminder of the key information you have already provided to Home Office about your individual/family circumstances; the second section is the plan you will make together for moving on with the help of the hotel wraparound support staff.</p>

<p>Please read your plan carefully so you understand the steps we are taking to assist you and what you must do to help yourself. If you have any questions regarding your plan or this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me: [Wraparound staff contact details]</p>

<p>I look forward to working with you.</p>

<p>[Name of hotel wraparound staff]</p>

<h4>Your ‘move-on’ plan</h4>

<p>Summary of the advice we have provided you with and the options we have discussed that are available to you are as follows:</p>

<h5>Accepting a matched property offer from the Home Office:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Home Office policy on offers of accommodation is that bridging hotel accommodation will end if you refuse two appropriate offers. If you refuse appropriate offers of accommodation and have not found housing for yourself, you will be referred to a local authority to assess what duties may be owed to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[For single people/childless couples]: local authorities have duties to assist homeless households to find accommodation, but they do not have to provide accommodation for all households without children (single people and couples) unless they are particularly vulnerable. It is therefore very important that you do not refuse offers of housing made by the Home Office if you do not have an alternative plan for where you live.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[For families]: local authorities have duties to assist homeless households to find accommodation and to provide temporary housing for families until they can offer settled housing, which is likely to be with a private landlord. The temporary or settled accommodation found under homelessness duties may not be in the same area as the local authority and waiting times could be extremely lengthy.</p>
