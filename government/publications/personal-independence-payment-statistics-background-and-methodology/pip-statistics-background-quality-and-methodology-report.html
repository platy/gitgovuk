<span class="number">2. </span> Statistical Presentation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Data Description</h3>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> is a benefit administered by the Department for Work and Pensions. It was introduced on 8 April 2013 to replace Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) for adults. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pip">more about <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr></a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics cover many different parts of the customer journey which are released as separate series in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat Xplore</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> customer journey can be complex and has many different stages from when a claimant first registers for a claim.</p>

<h4>2.1.1 Summary of Customer Journey</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/130324/Slide1.JPG"></div></figure>

<p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, some of the steps that a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claimant would follow have been changed.  A typical customer journey is given below, with COVID-19 changes highlighted:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Claimant registers their claim to PIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DWP issues the “How your disability affects you” (PIP2) form, for completion by the claimant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claimant completes and returns PIP2 form – this can lead to: a) automatic referral to the Assessment Provider (AP); b) disallowance of the claim based on the information in the PIP2 form; or c) disallowance of the claim if the claimant fails to return the PIP2 form without being identified as having additional support needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the claimant may have their claim assessed based on the paper evidence already submitted or may be called for a face-to-face assessment conducted by the AP. However, under COVID-19 provisions, telephone assessments have replaced the face-to-face channel. The claimant may: a) attend and participate in their assessment; or b) fail to attend or participate in the assessment, which can lead to a disallowance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DWP makes a decision based on the AP advice and any additional evidence received. The outcome may be: a) an award (including a monetary amount of the award for both Daily Living and Mobility components, the award type and, if appropriate, the period of time that should be allowed before a review of the award takes place); or b) a disallowance due to failing the assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment commences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the claim is in payment, a claimant must report any changes of circumstance relating to the claim, and this may lead to a review of the award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claims may undergo a planned award review when they reach the end of their review period (unless they received an ongoing award, where they will receive a light touch review after 10 years). Light touch reviews are in development and are due to begin in 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a reported change of circumstance or a planned award review, an “AR1” form is issued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the claimant disagrees with a decision on their claim, including where an award has been given, they can ask for a Mandatory Reconsideration (MR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the MR has been completed, if the claimant still disagrees with the decision they are able to lodge an appeal with Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some appeals are cleared without a tribunal hearing, where the following outcomes are possible: a) withdrawn by the customer, or struck out by the tribunal; or b) lapsed – where DWP change the decision in the customer’s favour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some appeals are cleared at a tribunal hearing, where the following outcomes are possible: a) DWP decision upheld by the tribunal; or b) DWP decision overturned by the tribunal. Under COVID-19 provisions, face to face hearings were replaced by telephone or video hearings, alongside paper-based hearings.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>2.1.2 Special Rules for End of Life</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has provided support to people nearing the end of their life through the Special Rules for Terminal Illness since 1990. A recent evaluation has shown that the clinical community has moved away from using ‘terminal illness’ and has instead adopted phrases like ‘End of Life’.</p>

<p>Current ‘Special Rules’ for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> apply to people who are likely to have 6 months or less to live. These rules ensure claims are dealt with quickly and sensitively. <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is changing the current 6-month Special Rules criteria to a model which considers whether an individual is likely to be in their final year of life, that is with a 12-month time-frame. In future, Special Rules will apply to people who have 12 months or less to live, and <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> are currently taking forward the necessary legislative change for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> in Parliament (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3157" rel="external">Social Security (Special Rules for End of Life) Bill</a>) with the change due to take effect following Royal Assent. For more detail on the Special Rules, see The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-factual-medical-reports-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals/the-special-rules-how-the-benefit-system-supports-people-nearing-the-end-of-life">‘Special Rules’: how the benefit system supports people nearing the end of life</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> Official Statistics formerly referred to Special Rules for Terminal Illness (<abbr title="Special Rules for Terminal Illness">SRTI</abbr>) but from June 2022 have been updated to use the term Special Rules for End of Life (SREL) instead. This change has been made for all commentary, tables, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>, with footnotes added to explain the amendment.</p>

<h4>2.1.3 Status of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics</h4>

<p>Published <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics are official statistics, with the exception of the following series which have experimental status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customer Journey Statistics</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Reference Area</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics published are available to view at country, region, local authority and parliamentary constituency level. The statistics represent <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims administered by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within Great Britain only. <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics relating to Northern Ireland are produced by the Department for Communications (<abbr title="Department for Communications">DfC</abbr>).</p>

<h4>2.2.1 <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> in Scotland</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/scotland.html" rel="external">Scotland Act 2016</a> gives Scottish Parliament powers over a number of social security benefits which had been administered to Scottish clients by the Department for Work and Pensions. From 1 April 2020, <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> became one of the benefits to have executive competency transferred from the <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to Social Security Scotland, the executive agency of Scottish Government which is responsible for delivering social security benefits for Scotland. From 1 September 2020, young people in Scotland can choose to remain on child <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> until the age of 18. From Autumn 2021, clients who live in Scotland and receive Disability Living Allowance for children will have their benefit replaced by Child Disability Payment. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mygov.scot/disability-living-allowance-children/" rel="external">Disability Living Allowance for children in Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>There has been a transitional period to allow administration of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> to be transferred to Scotland, during which time <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> continued to administer <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> on Social Security Scotland’s behalf.</p>

<p>The Scottish Government is now replacing <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment-launch" rel="external">Adult Disability Payment (ADP)</a>, a new benefit launched in 2022. Depending on where new claimants live, they have applied for ADP rather than <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> on or after these dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>21 March 2022, for those who live in Dundee City, Perth and Kinross or the Western Isles (Na h-Eileanan Siar)</li>
  <li>20 June 2022, for those who live in Angus, North Lanarkshire or South Lanarkshire</li>
  <li>25 July 2022, for those who live in Fife, Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray, North Ayrshire, East Ayrshire or South Ayrshire</li>
  <li>29 August 2022, for those who live elsewhere in Scotland</li>
</ul>

<p>For existing <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claimants who live in Scotland, Social Security Scotland began to move clients to ADP from Summer 2022. <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claimants in Scotland will be sent a letter telling them what will happen when they transfer, but will not have to do anything to start an ADP claim or end a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claim as this will be managed for them. <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to pay a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claim until the transfer is complete.</p>

<p>While Official <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> Statistics will continue to be produced and published for all claims administered by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, from September 2022 the following changes have been made to reflect the change in Scotland from <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> to ADP</p>

<ul>
  <li>commentary in the main body of the release bulletin focusses on statistics for England &amp; Wales, with a new separate section covering Scotland.</li>
  <li>Stat-Xplore continues to hold figures for Scotland alongside England &amp; Wales. A new high level geography breakdown has been added to allow users to easily select people with “<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy ownership” (England, Wales, plus abroad/unknown cases) or “Policy devolved to Scotland” (those residing in Scotland but with their <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claim still administered by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>). Footnotes have been added to alert users to the changes in Scotland.</li>
  <li>static tables published as ODS/Excel files have been split to give an England &amp; Wales version and a Scotland version.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach allows users to access statistics for all <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> cases administered by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, but focuses commentary on trends affecting cases in England &amp; Wales, while also showing the depleting caseload in Scotland.</p>

<p>Official <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> Statistics do not include anybody who is claiming ADP and residing in Scotland, and there are no plans to incorporate ADP statistics into the <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> publication, although they can be found as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/social-security-scotland-stats-publications/" rel="external">Social Security Scotland statistics: publications</a> collection published by the Scottish Government. In addition, Scotland publish <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics based on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/collections/social-security-scotland-stats-publications" rel="external"><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims within Scotland</a> only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Classification System</h3>

<h4>2.3.1 Data published on Stat Xplore</h4>

<p>All Stat Xplore datasets can be tabulated by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Residential Geographies (Great Britain, Country, Region, Local Authority and Westminster Parliament Constituency)</li>
  <li>Month</li>
  <li>Gender</li>
  <li>Reassessment Indicator</li>
  <li>Terminally Ill Indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>The “Policy Ownership” geographical breakdown allows users of these statistics to include/exclude claims in Scotland, where trends are expected to follow different patterns to the rest of Great Britain due to Scottish devolution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrieving “<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Policy Ownership” will return claims administered by with England, Wales, abroad and unknown addresses. The next level of geographical breakdown allows these four categories to be viewed separately.</li>
  <li>Retrieving “Policy Devolved to Scotland” will provide users with the residual claims in Scotland.</li>
  <li>Making no geographical selection at the “Policy Ownership” level will return all claims administered by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a disability classification is available, these statistics classify medical conditions or disabilities in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disability groupings based on <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> data standard (as at 7 March 2013)</li>
  <li>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (<abbr title="International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems">ICD</abbr>) categories and groupings</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment statistics published on Stat Xplore have main disability condition sourced from both the original <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claim and from the subsequent <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claim, and categorisations differ in structure. A claimant may also be re-categorised if their main disabling condition has changed between their <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> and <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims based on the information given during the claim process.</p>

<p>The following table lists the datasets and measures that are available within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat Xplore</a> and the additional breakdowns available within specific datasets.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Statistical Concepts and Definitions</h3>

<p>Three different measures are used within the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Count: a count of the number of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims within a dataset. This is specific to the dataset, for example Registrations data set shows a count of claims registered</li>
  <li>Median Measure: Where the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistic reported is a period of time – clearance times, outstanding times, mandatory reconsideration clearance times – the median measure is used. The median time is the middle value if all times are ordered from lowest to highest. The median is used rather than an arithmetic mean to avoid extreme values skewing the data</li>
  <li>Average financial award amount: This measure is available within the Cases with Entitlement and clearances datasets. It is calculated as the mean of all individual financial awards. For the Cases with Entitlement dataset, this is equivalent to the mean amount for each claim. For the clearances, <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment and child <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment datasets, the mean is only calculated for clearances where an award is made – disallowed or withdrawn cases are excluded from all mean financial award calculations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Statistical Unit</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics count <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims rather than individuals – one individual could make separate <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims at different points in time and these would be counted separately.</p>

<p>For the annual <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment statistics specifically, only the first claim per claimant is included. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="#count-of-reassessments">section 3.4.19</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Time Coverage</h3>

<p>From 8 April 2013 <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> started to replace <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> for working age people with <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. Statistics on <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> are published quarterly in March, June, September and December respectively. The exception to this, is the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment statistics which are published on an annual basis in December. The majority of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> data have a one and a half month time lag to the quarter the statistics are published in.</p>

<p>Customer journey statistics have a 6-month time lag for initial decisions (clearances) following a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> assessment and a 3-month time lag for corresponding <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr> and appeals data to the quarter it is published in. For example, the December 2019 release covered initial decisions following a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> assessment up to June 2019, and for <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr> and appeals to September 2019.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Statistical Processing</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Source Data</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics are based on administrative data sourced from the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> computer systems (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr>, <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr>), which are used by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to administer <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>/<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claims.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Data Collection</h3>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> data are transferred from the live system to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> Atomic Data Store (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Atomic Data Store">ADS</abbr>) daily with a lag of two to three days from when the live case management system records any changes. Data are extracted from the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Atomic Data Store">ADS</abbr> each quarter to produce the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Data validation</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff follow detailed guidance and undergo training to minimise errors during data entry. Further automatic validation checks are carried out after this and they include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details checked against Customer Information Systems (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>) data</li>
  <li>rule-based checks at different stages of a claims lifecycle</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>	Data Compilation</h3>

<p>This section describes the methodology behind the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics. It explains how data are linked together and how new variables are created.</p>

<h4>3.4.1 Geography</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> data is a central database containing details of individuals who have interacted with any <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems. <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> is used to provide the geographical data associated with each claim and is linked via the claimants National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>). Approximately 0 to 1% of claims have a missing <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>. Records without a <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> are classified as “Unknown” in the geography category.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Disability</h4>

<p>The main disabling condition of a claimant is recorded at assessment. A claimant may undergo more than one assessment – an initial assessment at the start of the claim and then further assessments if they report a change of circumstance or undergo a planned award review. The recorded disability may therefore change during the life of a claim. For the clearances, <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> clearances, award reviews and changes of circumstances disability is shown as at the relevant date (for example, date of clearance, award review etc.). For the cases with entitlement data, the latest known disability is shown as at caseload date.</p>

<h4>3.4.3 Age</h4>

<p>The age of a claimant (in years) is derived from their date of birth. Age is calculated as at the relevant time point of interest, for example as at registration date. <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claimants must be aged 16 or over, so, any records with a date of birth outside of this are classified as an error and are marked as “Unknown or missing”.</p>

<h4>3.4.4 State Pension Age</h4>

<p>Shows if a claimant is of state pension age at relevant time point as above. Derived using the age and gender variables and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-timetable-for-state-pension-changes-to-maintain-fair-and-sustainable-pension">state pension age government criteria</a>. When a claim has missing data within date of birth or gender variables, it will be classified as “Unknown”.</p>

<h4>3.4.5 Special rules for End of Life (SREL) Indicator</h4>

<p>A claim can be identified as SREL claim at different points in the process, including at the initial registration of the claim or before a claim is cleared. This means that it is possible for SREL clearances to be higher than SREL registrations in a given quarter.</p>

<h4>3.4.6 How volumes are counted</h4>

<p>Measure of counts for all datasets except <a class="govuk-link" href="#count-of-reassessments"><abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="#count-of-reassessments">Child <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#cases-with-entitlement">Cases with Entitlement</a>, is calculated by counting the number of unique claims. An individual can make a claim more than once and each time a claim is made; it is counted in the relevant dataset.</p>

<h4>3.4.7 Award Type</h4>

<p>The recommended review date of a claim is set to a date at which <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> considers that the claimant’s needs might change sufficiently to warrant a review. An expected end date is the date at which an award will come to an end. The Award Type variable is created using a claimants recommended review date and expected end date as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Award Type</th>
      <th scope="col">Recommended Review Date</th>
      <th scope="col">Expected End Date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Not Awarded</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short Term Award (no review date)</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>Required – 9 months to 2 years after assessment date</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>On-going award</td>
      <td>Required - 10 years after assessment date</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Awarded under Special Rules for Terminal Illness</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>Required – 3 years after assessment date</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fixed Term award with review</td>
      <td>Required – within a year of the end date</td>
      <td>Required – one year anniversary of review date</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The review period is calculated by finding the time between a claims assessment date and their recommended review date.</p>

<p>A small number of claims (less than 1% of all award types) have been incorrectly classified as “Short Term Award (no review date)”. These cases should have been recorded as “On-going award”. In addition to these, there are some claimants aged above state pension age who have been incorrectly recorded as having an award with a review date of less than 10 years. Work is underway to fix both these issues.</p>

<h4>3.4.8 Award Rate</h4>

<p>Award Rate is calculated as claims awarded in the month over all clearances in the month and can be viewed including or excluding withdrawn claims, as part of the calculation.</p>

<h4>3.4.9 Assessment Award Rate</h4>

<p>Assessment Award Rate is calculated as claims awarded in the month over all claims which have had an assessment in the month.</p>

<h4>3.4.10 Average Financial Award Measure (Mean)</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pip/what-youll-get">financial award amount</a> given to a claimant can vary based on their circumstances. The mean is calculated from the weekly financial award amount:</p>

<ul>
  <li>of all claims that have been awarded <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> as at clearance date (clearances dataset)</li>
  <li>or the 28th day of the caseload month (cases with entitlement dataset)</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.4.11 Count of Cases with Entitlement</h4>

<p>When a <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claim begins or ends, “on flow” or “off flow” events are captured in the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Atomic Data Store">ADS</abbr>. To calculate the cases with entitlement measure, for each month all on and off flow events that have occurred are selected and the latest event is retained only if it is an on flow, leading to a dataset that contains one record per claim per month. To ensure historical counts of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> cases with entitlement are accurate, the data is linked to <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>, using a claimant’s <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>, to identify and remove deceased claimants.</p>

<p>Approximately 0.1% of cases with entitlement are reported “nil” for both award components (daily living, mobility). This is because a review is in process, which means these cases are subject to revision.</p>

<h4>3.4.12 Median Clearance Times and Outstanding Times</h4>

<p>For each claim, clearance times are calculated by finding the difference between the dates for each customer journey stage. Outstanding times are calculated by finding the difference between the beginning of a customer journey stage and the end of the month in which the next stage is still outstanding.</p>

<p>The median of all clearance and outstanding times are calculated in working days. For normal rules clearance times and outstanding times this median is divided by 5 to report the clearance time in weeks. The median is used instead of an arithmetic mean to avoid the data being skewed by extremely long/short claims.</p>

<h4>3.4.13 Median <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> Clearance Time</h4>

<p>This is calculated by taking the difference between the <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> registration date and its clearance date, in calendar days, for claims made under normal rules, excluding all withdrawn/cancelled claims.  The median time is calculated by taking the middle value if all times are ordered from lowest to highest. The median is used rather than an arithmetic mean to avoid extreme values skewing the data.</p>

<h4>3.4.14 Financial Year</h4>

<p>Within the <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> clearance times dataset, this is created through defining each financial year as 1st April YYYY – 31st March YYYY+1. For example, the 2013 to 2014 Financial Year took place from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014.</p>

<h4>3.4.15 Customer Journey Statistics</h4>

<p>These statistics provide a cohort measure. These data link an initial decision, <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> and Appeal through the claim ID and the date of the occurrence of the claim.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> or Appeal can be raised up to 13 months after the initial <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> clearance or <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> clearances, respectively. Any registered outside of this timescale are excluded.</p>

<h4>3.4.16 <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> Award Changed Rate</h4>

<p>This is calculated as <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr> cleared where the award was changed in the period over all <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> decisions (excluding withdrawals and cancellations).</p>

<h4>3.4.17 Tribunal Overturn Rate</h4>

<p>This is calculated as appeals cleared at a tribunal hearing where the <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decision was overturned in the period over all appeals cleared at a tribunal hearing.</p>

<h4>3.4.18 Planned Award Review and Change of Circumstances Clearance Outcome</h4>

<p>Prior to 25 June 2016, the outcomes of a review or change of circumstances were “Changed” and “Unchanged”.</p>

<p>From 25 June 2016, where a claimant was awarded <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>, the award change is recorded as: “Increased”, “Decreased”, “Maintained”, “Disallowed”, “Award Voluntary Relinquished” or “Withdrawn”. The first three categories aforementioned are derived by comparing the award levels before and after the decision.</p>

<p>Due to this operational change, the clearances dataset is split into 2 series.</p>

<h4>3.4.19 Count of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessments (Child and Adult)</h4>

<p>Claimants can register multiple reassessment claims to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. Only the first claim will be included in the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment statistics. This is done through identifying all claims made by an individual using their <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> and then finding the first claim submitted for each claimant.</p>

<h4>3.4.20 <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> Data</h4>

<p>To produce the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> reassessment statistics a reassessed <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claim must be matched to its original <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claim, a claimants <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> is used to do this. The <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> is extracted from the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr>, through scanning through data from 2013 onwards and identifying the most recent occurrence of a claimants <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>. The first occurrence of a claimants <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> on the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr> is used.</p>

<h4>3.4.21 <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> Award Level</h4>

<p>The claimant’s final <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> award is taken from the most recent quarter that they were on the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> caseload.</p>

<h4>3.4.22 <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> Reassessment Outcome</h4>

<p>Award Increased/Unchanged/Decreased values for this variable are calculated through subtracting the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> award amount from the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> award amount and then assigning it to the corresponding group based on the result.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Quality Management</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Quality Assurance</h3>

<h4>4.1.1 Initial quality assurance conducted during data development</h4>

<p>During the initial data development various activities took place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visits to <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Benefit Centres to assess and understand claim processing activities and shape quality assurance procedures</li>
  <li>Collaboration with data providers to understand the impact of changes to source data on statistical outputs</li>
  <li>Collaboration with <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> colleagues from operations, policy and business support to ensure the policy is being delivered as intended.</li>
</ul>

<p>Checks were performed to assess:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reliability, completeness and level of disclosure of individual variables</li>
  <li>Levels of duplicate, missing or contradictory information</li>
  <li>Consistency across computer systems (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Atomic Data Store">ADS</abbr>) and management information</li>
  <li>Monthly accumulation of data in the system compared to expected patterns</li>
  <li>Trends and variation in characteristic, time series and geographical breakdowns</li>
  <li>Whether <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> claims, <abbr title="Assessment Providers">AP</abbr> referrals, <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr> and Appeals data have been linked together accurately</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.1.2 Quality Assurance Group</h4>

<p>This group contains members involved in analysis, operations and policy development of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. Their function is to scrutinise figures and commentary in advance of the publication, to ensure its accuracy and robustness.</p>

<h4>4.1.3 Routine Quality Assurance Checks</h4>

<p>A general quality assurance checklist is provided to all statistical producers in <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This checklist conforms to Quality Assurance of Administrative Data guidance. This has been tailored for the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics production process.</p>

<p>Each quarter a number of checks are made:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Ensuring code has been updated correctly during data extraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing figures with the last publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing figures with management information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparing trends over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussing any discrepancies and trends seen within the data with the Quality Assurance group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring all figures are correctly cited in the publication (i.e. release document, Stat-Xplore and summary tables).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring commentary and supporting information is accurate and impartial.</p>

<p>Users are invited to provide feedback through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/personal-independence-payment-statistics"><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> landing page</a> or release.</p>

<p>A quarterly meeting is held with <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To assess whether their needs are being met</li>
  <li>To prioritise and create developments</li>
  <li>To gather feedback on any potential changes</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1st August 2019 to the 10th October 2019, <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> carried out a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/dwp-statistics-publication-frequency-statistical-notice">consultation to review the frequency of a number of publications</a>, including <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>, with the view to scale down the publication cycle to biannual. Users were against this change in the initial phase of the consultation, so the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics were removed from the scope of this consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Accuracy and Reliability</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Overall Accuracy</h3>

<p>Measurements and processing errors could occur during data entry onto the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr>. To mitigate against these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data provided by the claimant is validated at different stages of the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> journey</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff undergo training on how to input data correctly</li>
  <li>A set of automated checks take place when data is input onto the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>The use of variables which are susceptible to processing errors are avoided</li>
</ul>

<p>To maintain confidentiality of claimants data within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat Xplore</a> are perturbed. This means that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/metadata/Data%20Confidentiality.html?dbid=UC_Monthly" rel="external">random error</a> is purposefully introduced.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Data Revision</h3>

<h4>6.2.1 Policy on Data Revisions</h4>

<h4>Planned Revisions</h4>

<p>Every quarter, all <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> data series are refreshed. This allows full retrospection of data to include any back-dated claims. The exception to this is Planned Award Review and Change of Circumstances clearances.</p>

<p>For customer journey statistics, as time passes, new <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr> or Appeals will be raised that are associated with initial decisions that have occurred in past quarters.</p>

<p>Planned Award Review and Change of Circumstances clearance statistics are not refreshed prior to June 2016, as methodology and data sources changed from this date onwards.</p>

<p>Any conceptual or methodological changes are taken through the usual route of; consulting relevant users, checking accuracy, impact, and robustness, of any proposed changes and finally, communicating back to users on the final changes.</p>

<h4>Unplanned Revisions to correct errors</h4>

<p>When an unplanned error occurs, data is revised and put out publicly as soon as practicable, with measures to ensure any corrections are accurate and robust.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Timeliness and punctuality</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Timeliness</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics have a lag of one and a half months from the publication date and the data reference period, except customer journey statistics and annual <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> reassessment statistics. This enables transfer of data from <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Computer System">CS</abbr> to the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Atomic Data Store">ADS</abbr> up to the end of the reference period and allows time for the statistics to be produced. This means we publish in the following quarters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>March (data to January)</li>
  <li>June (data to April)</li>
  <li>September (data to July)</li>
  <li>December (data to October) including annual <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> reassessment statistics</li>
</ul>

<p>All data begins from April 2013, when the service of <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> began.</p>

<p>The customer journey statistics have a time lag of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Five and a half months for initial decisions</li>
  <li>Two and a half months for <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Two and a half months for appeals</li>
</ul>

<p>This additional lag is to allow more time for cohorts to progress through the customer journey from initial decision through to <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> and Appeal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Punctuality</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics have been delivered on time, in line with preannouncement dates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Coherence and comparability</h2>

<p>Quarterly <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics originate from the same data source, and therefore are comparable over time.</p>

<p>Award Review and Change of Circumstances clearance data consist of two data series (pre- and post-June 2016), which can only be compared once data categories of the latter series are aggregated. This is because the <a class="govuk-link" href="#planned-award-review-clearance-outcome">outcome variable</a> changed in June 2016 to provide more detailed categories.</p>

<p><abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> geographical data is updated annually to reflect any geographical changes which may have occurred (for example a merging of a parliamentary constituency). Due to this, care should be taken if users decide to compare figures published at different time periods.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of Adult Disability Payment in Scotland, trends in Scottish <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> cases are expected to diverge from the rest of the country. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#pip-scotland">section 2.2.1</a> for more details of Scottish Devolution. From March 2022 onwards, care should be taken to examine Scottish data separately to England &amp; Wales (plus abroad &amp; unknown cases).</p>

<p>The volume of <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsiderations">MRs</abbr> and Appeals within the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> customer journey statistics will differ to other published sources, such as figures in Stat Xplore, and published tables within the quarterly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tribunals-statistics">Ministry of Justice tribunal statistics</a>. This is due to customer journey statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>publishing information on one <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> and appeal per initial <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> decision</li>
  <li>excluding decisions prior to an assessment completed</li>
  <li>excluding Award Reviews and Changes of Circumstances decisions</li>
  <li>lag of recording data</li>
  <li>methodological differences</li>
</ul>

<p>Appeals data published within <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> customer journey statistics are not comparable to appeals data published in the quarterly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/employment-and-support-allowance-outcomes-of-work-capability-assessment">Employment Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>): Work Capability Assessments (<abbr title="Work Capability Assessments">WCA</abbr>), Mandatory Reconsiderations and Appeals release</a>. <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics appeals data covers appeals lodged and their outcomes, whereas <abbr title="Employment Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>: <abbr title="Work Capability Assessments">WCA</abbr>, <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> and Appeals is based on appeals cleared at a hearing.</p>

<p>The average clearance times for individual parts of the claimant journey may not sum to the end-to-end times. The end-to-end median time is based on all cleared or in progress cases taken together, whereas the volume of cases and distribution of clearance times for individual stages will differ from stage to stage.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> clearance times are based on the clearance times from the point of registration to the date the <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> was cleared (excluding those withdrawn or cancelled). This is different to the <abbr title="Employment Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> <abbr title="Work Capability Assessments">WCA</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> clearance times. The <abbr title="Employment Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> <abbr title="Work Capability Assessments">WCA</abbr> <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> clearance times is derived using calendar days by calculating the median of the time taken from the date the Benefit Centre (<abbr title="Benefit Centre">BC</abbr>) has decided the <abbr title="Mandatory Reconsideration">MR</abbr> to be valid, having considered any new information, until the date the decision is cleared by the decision maker at the Dispute Resolution Team (<abbr title="Dispute Resolution Team">DRT</abbr>).</p>
