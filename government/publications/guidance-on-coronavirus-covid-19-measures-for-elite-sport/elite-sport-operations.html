<p><strong>Plan B: upcoming changes</strong></p>

<p>The government has announced that the measures put in place under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021/covid-19-response-autumn-and-winter-plan-2021#plan-b" class="govuk-link">Plan B of the Autumn/Winter COVID-19 response</a> in England will be lifted.</p>

<p>This means that workers are no longer asked to work from home if they can. Employers should talk to their workers to agree arrangements to return to the workplace.</p>

<p>From 27 January:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There will no longer be a legal requirement for people to wear face coverings. People are still advised to wear one in crowded and indoor spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet.</li>
  <li>Venues and events will no longer be required by law to check the COVID status of their customers. They can still choose to use the NHS COVID Pass on a voluntary basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance will be updated shortly to include more information on these changes. You should continue to follow all of the guidance on this page to keep yourself and others safe.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What’s changed</h2>

<p>This guidance was updated on 21 January to reflect changes to the rules on testing and quarantine when travelling to England. There have been changes to the sections on <a class="govuk-link" href="#internationaltravel">international travel</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#exemptions">elite sport exemptions</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#international">international sportspersons</a> and <a href="#domestic" class="govuk-link">domestic sportspersons</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document sets out a recommended framework for the operation of elite sport. It sets out guidance for elite sport organisations on how to reduce the risk from COVID-19 for athletes, coaches, support staff, and other members of the elite sport operational structure. This includes guidance for UK-based elite sports organisations and individuals travelling to competition or training outside the UK.</p>

<p>This replaces the previous elite sport guidance, which set out a phased 5-stage return to training and competition to ensure the successful resumption of elite sport.</p>

<p>It is supplemented by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which outlines how competition delivery partners and venues should plan and manage sporting events with spectators.</p>

<p>This guidance does not constitute legal advice or replace any other government or PHE advice; nor does it provide any commentary or advice on health-related issues. Any relevant government and guidance on public health measures will take precedence over any other standards (such as competition standards set by international competition organisers, international federations or governments), unless otherwise specified.</p>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Key principles</h2>

<p><strong>Sport organisations, venue operators and competition organisers should:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Complete a risk assessment that includes risks from COVID-19.</strong> For venue operators and other employers, this is an obligation under health and safety law. For sport organisations which are not employers, this is good practice which will help you to understand the risks relevant to your organisation and any steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Your risk assessment should consider the points below in the rest of this guidance. It should also take into account any reasonable adjustments needed for staff and customers with disabilities. It is considered good practice to nominate a COVID-19 officer to lead your COVID-19 risk assessment and put in place risk mitigation and appropriate protocols. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#risk">section on risk assessments</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider appointing a named COVID-19 medical officer</strong> to set protocols for infection management, medical cover and equipment, and oversee testing/symptom screening requirements and return of athletes following illness. This will depend on the size of your organisation and the provision you have. It could be an existing medical officer (where you have one) or the responsibility of one of the medical team. The medical officer should work with the COVID-19 officer (where you have one) to inform the medical aspects of the risk register and set appropriate protocols. There is further information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#medical">section on medical protocols</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that appropriate cleaning and hygiene protocols are in place to manage risk.</strong> Review your cleaning and hygiene protocols for training and competition facilities, and put in place any additional safety measures identified by your risk register. You should ask people in your organisation/using your facility to use hand sanitiser and clean their hands frequently, and provide them with advice to promote good hygiene. You can find more information in the <a href="#cleaning" class="govuk-link">section on cleaning and hygiene</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Check that any facilities you use/operate provide adequate ventilation.</strong> You should make sure there is a supply of fresh air to enclosed spaces where there are people present. This can be natural ventilation through windows, doors and vents; mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts; or a combination of both. If you operate a facility or venue, you should identify any poorly ventilated spaces in your premises and consider steps you can take to improve fresh air flow in these areas. In some places, a CO2 monitor can help to identify if the space is poorly ventilated. You can find more information in the <a href="#ventilation" class="govuk-link">section on ventilation</a> and the <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">HSE guidance on ventilation and air conditioning during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Enable people to check in at your venue.</strong> You are no longer legally required to collect contact details, however doing so will help to support NHS Test and Trace to reduce the spread of the virus. You can enable people to check in by providing an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster" class="govuk-link">NHS QR code poster</a>, though you do not have to ask customers to check in or turn them away if they refuse. If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details for those who ask to check in but do not have the app. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#qrcode">section on NHS QR codes</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider the impact of athletes or staff being required to isolate</strong> on planned training or competitions, and whether you can put in place any contingency arrangements to minimise disruption. Anyone who is notified by NHS Test and Trace that they need to self-isolate must do so. Should a known or suspected COVID-19 case occur in the elite environment, or an individual be identified as a contact of a known case, you should follow the protocols set by the COVID-19 medical officer. You can find more information in the <a href="#cases" class="govuk-link">section on cases and outbreaks</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure athletes and staff supporting elite sport are aware of the risks</strong> involved in elite sport activity, mitigating steps being taken and measures they should follow.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider any additional risks that may affect athletes or staff who have a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, or live with people in higher-risk groups.</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>If an elite sport event takes place at a venue which may require certification:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>People who are providing services at a venue or to an event (such as the athletes, referees and other officials) should not be counted towards the thresholds. They are not required to show their COVID status. You can ask these workers for evidence of their COVID status; however, you should consider whether this is proportionately beneficial as part of your event-specific mitigations. You also need to carefully consider how this fits with other obligations to workers and customers arising from e.g. employment rights, health and safety laws and equality legislation.</li>
      <li>Other attendees, including spectators, should be counted towards the number of attendees and are required to show their COVID status.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Review any other relevant guidance for further advice.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are planning events with spectators (or hosting other events open to visitors in your facility) you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out the points you should consider for events with spectators. There is advice on the types of measures you can take to reduce risk at events, and a risk management template to help you plan your event.</li>
      <li>Review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on face coverings</a>, which details when face coverings must be worn by law and when their use is optional.</li>
      <li>Those operating workplaces should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">guidance on working safely</a> in different types of environments such as offices, retail environments and hospitality facilities.</li>
      <li>If you are operating a sport facility, or you also cover grassroots sport provision, you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-the-public-and-sport-providers" class="govuk-link">guidance on grassroots sport</a>. This includes advice on sport participation and provision, as well as specific guidance for operators of sport facilities which may be relevant to your venue.</li>
      <li>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event" class="govuk-link">further guidance for organisations on how to use the NHS COVID Pass</a> at venues, events and settings in England.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Risk assessments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Who should do a risk assessment</h3>

<p>Sport organisations, venue operators and other relevant organisations (such as competition delivery partners) should have in place a risk assessment that includes risks from COVID-19. You should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a> and the <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" class="govuk-link">Health and Safety Executive’s guidance</a> for further information on risk assessments.</p>

<p>You can nominate a COVID-19 officer to lead your COVID-19 risk assessment and put in place risk mitigation and appropriate protocols. A COVID-19 officer would act as the person responsible for oversight of COVID-19 risk assessments and ensuring the necessary level of risk mitigations are in place. This should include any relevant partners, such as the medical officer who will advise on medical protocols. The COVID-19 officer will also coordinate sharing of risk assessments or risk management plans with their organisation, and with partner organisations they work with (e.g. with a competition organiser and venue, ahead of a competition).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Consider designating a member of staff as your COVID-19 officer.</strong> This would include oversight of venues and facilities which are operated by the sport, though they should assess and put in place a suitable structure for their sport. For example, sports may wish to nominate COVID-19 officers for clubs/teams/training groups or venues/facilities they operate, working within the protocols set by the lead COVID-19 officer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Facilities and venues which are not sport-run</strong> may have their own COVID-19 officer responsible for assessing and managing COVID-19 risks.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Where multiple sports/clubs are using the same site(s),</strong> all COVID-19 officers should share their risk assessments and operational plans to ensure alignment and avoid any potential conflict between plans. It may be helpful to appoint a lead COVID-19 officer to manage this process, such as the venue operator’s COVID-19 officer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>When delivering elite sport competitions,</strong> each operating partner should appoint a named COVID-19 officer for every competition in which they have an interest. All COVID-19 officers should share their risk assessments and operational plans to ensure alignment and avoid any potential conflict between plans. It may be helpful to appoint a lead COVID-19 officer to manage this process.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sport organisations which are not employers</strong></p>

<p>For sport organisations which are not employers, doing a risk assessment is good practice which will help you to understand the risks relevant to your organisation and any steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19. You should read the guidance in this section and introduce reasonable measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19. However, this is not a legal requirement unless you are an employer.</p>

<p><strong>Venue operators and other employers</strong></p>

<p>For venue operators and other employers, doing a risk assessment is an obligation under health and safety law. As an employer, by law you must protect workers and others (including contractors, volunteers and customers/users) from risks to their health and safety. This includes risks from COVID-19.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is a workplace hazard. You should manage it in the same way as other workplace hazards. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace</li>
  <li>identifying control measures to manage that risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to.</p>

<p><strong>Failure to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, and put in place control measures to manage the risk of COVID-19 in the workplace, may be considered a breach of health and safety law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consult your workers</strong></p>

<p>As an employer, you have a legal duty to consult workers on health and safety matters. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work they do and how you will manage the risks from COVID-19.</p>

<p>You may do this by consulting with any recognised trade union health and safety representatives. If you do not have any, you can consult with a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If you cannot do this, see below for other steps you can take.</p>

<p><strong>Raising concerns</strong></p>

<p>If you’re an employee, you can contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your employee representative</li>
  <li>your trade union if you have one</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also contact HSE’s COVID-19 enquiries team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online: <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://hsegov.microsoftcrmportals.com/workingsafelyenquiries/">working safely enquiry form</a>
</li>
  <li>telephone: 0300 790 6787 (Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 5pm)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>

<p>Enforcing authorities identify employers who do not take action to comply with the relevant law and guidance to control public health risks. When they do, they can take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. The HSE and your local authority are examples of enforcing authorities.</p>

<p>When they identify serious breaches, enforcing authorities can do a number of things. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sending you a letter.</li>
  <li>serving you with an improvement or prohibition notice.</li>
  <li>bringing a prosecution against you, in cases where they identify significant breaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an enforcing authority issues you with any advice or notices, you should respond rapidly and within their timescales. Inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<p>Under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 3) Regulations 2020, local authorities continue to have the power to place public health restrictions on businesses in cases where there is a serious and imminent threat to public health posed by COVID-19. However, coronavirus legislation does not impose any restrictions on the types of events which can take place, and local authorities may only exercise those powers by issuing a direction where that is necessary in public health terms, and any prohibitions, requirements or conditions imposed by the Direction are proportionate to the risk. Further information is available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-under-coronavirus-regulations/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-health-protection-coronavirus-restrictions-england-no3-regulations-2020" class="govuk-link">guidance on local authority powers to impose restrictions</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>How to do a risk assessment</h3>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">tools to support you</a>.</p>

<p>You do not have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have fewer than 5 workers</li>
  <li>are self-employed</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may still find it useful to do so.</p>

<p>To carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, you should consider the different ways the virus can be spread (aerosols, droplets and surfaces) and put in place measures to reduce the risk of each type of transmission. An example of the factors you should consider is included in the box below.</p>

<p>Some activities can increase the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19. This happens where people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe heavily, such as singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices. You should consider the specific risks of your facility or event, and take additional care to manage situations where there is a higher risk of catching or passing on COVID-19.</p>

<p>You will need to translate this into the specific actions you need to take. These will depend on the nature of your organisation, including the size and type of business, how it is organised, operated and managed. The risk assessment should be reviewed regularly to ensure the measures put in place are appropriate for the various settings elite sport is operating in (e.g. training schedules and competition). This will help you to ensure that you have appropriate protocols (such as cleaning and hygiene protocols and medical protocols) in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<p>This applies to sport organisations and venue operators as well as to events you may organise. If you are organising events, you should also consider the risk factors identified by the Events Research Programme when undertaking risk assessments. These are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, along with options for managing and reducing these risks and a risk management template to help you plan your event.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment should also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An up-to-date plan for what you will do in the event of an outbreak in your workplace. This includes nominating a member of staff as the single point of contact who will contact local public health teams. You can find more information in the <a href="#cases" class="govuk-link">section on cases and outbreaks</a>.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that workers, customers and visitors who feel unwell do not come to the workplace. By law, businesses must not require a worker who is legally required to self-isolate to work anywhere other than where they are self-isolating (normally their home).</li>
  <li>Risks arising from periods of closure. If your building is unoccupied or has reduced occupancy during a period of restrictions, you should take steps to manage any risks that could arise when reopening (for example, by reviewing <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/legionella-risks-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm" class="govuk-link">HSE’s guidance on the risk of legionella</a>.</li>
  <li>The impact of your policies on groups who have protected characteristics, and to those who are more at risk of being infected with COVID-19 or have a higher risk of serious illness.</li>
  <li>Managing risk in any unusual workplaces. This could include specialist construction sites, where it can be necessary for people to work in close contact in enclosed spaces (such as roof spaces). You should consider ways to modify the work area or working practices to mitigate risk, and may find relevant advice in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/construction-and-other-outdoor-work" class="govuk-link">guidance for construction and other outdoor work</a>.</li>
  <li>The security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place. Any revisions could present new or altered security risks you may need to mitigate.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Risks to consider</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aerosol and droplet transmission - ventilation</strong></p>

<p>The main way of spreading COVID-19 is through close contact with an infected person. When someone with COVID-19 breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they release particles (droplets and aerosols) containing the virus that causes COVID-19. These particles can be breathed in by another person.</p>

<p>To reduce aerosol transmission, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How best to increase ventilation in your facility. There are different ways of providing ventilation, including mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts, natural ventilation which relies on passive flow through openings (doors, windows, vents) or a combination of the two. Open doors, windows and air vents where possible, to improve natural ventilation.</li>
  <li>Identifying any poorly ventilated spaces and taking steps to improve fresh air flow in these areas. A CO2 monitor could help you assess whether a space is poorly ventilated, and if you should switch on additional mechanical ventilation or open windows. If you can’t improve ventilation in poorly ventilated spaces, consider restricting the number of people in these spaces or stop using them if possible.</li>
  <li>Encouraging the use of outdoor space wherever possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce droplet transmission, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Putting in place measures to reduce contact between people, particularly between customers and workers. Where practical, measures could include:
    <ul>
      <li>Keeping the activity time involved as short as possible.</li>
      <li>Using screens or barriers to separate people (which can be beneficial if placed between people who will come into close proximity with each other) or using back-to-back or side-to-side working for your staff, instead of face-to-face.</li>
      <li>Reducing the number of people your workers have contact with, for example by using fixed teams, partnering or cohorting, so that each person works with only a few others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Advocating the use of face coverings even where it is not legally required, particularly in crowded and enclosed spaces where others may come into contact with people they do not normally meet. Read the <a href="#facecoverings" class="govuk-link">section on face coverings</a> for further information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Surface transmission</strong></p>

<p>Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19, when people who are infected cough or sneeze near them or if they touch them.</p>

<p>To reduce surface transmission, consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintaining regular cleaning of surfaces, particularly surfaces that people touch regularly.</li>
  <li>Advising customers and workers to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser frequently. This is particularly important before and after touching shared objects or surfaces that other people touch regularly.</li>
  <li>Providing additional handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser, particularly in high-traffic or higher-risk areas, such as reception and entrance foyers, doorways, lifts and bathroom facilities.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Medical protocols</h2>

<p>Consider appointing COVID-19 medical officer to set protocols for infection management, medical cover and equipment, and oversee testing/symptom screening requirements and return of athletes following illness.</p>

<p><strong>It is recommended that each sport, venue and competition organiser has a named COVID-19 medical officer</strong> (except where these are part of the same organisation - e.g. a sport-run facility, or competition for your sport in your own facility). This will depend on the size of your organisation and the provision you have. It could be an existing medical officer (where you have one) or the responsibility of one of the medical team. It is good practice for this to be a physician who is familiar with the emerging evidence related to post-COVID-19 pathology.</p>

<p>The medical officer should work with the COVID-19 officer (where you have one) to inform the medical aspects of the risk register and set appropriate protocols.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 medical officer should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support the COVID-19 officer with any medical aspects of the risk assessment and mitigation process. This will include setting protocols for testing and screening, infection management, medical cover and equipment.</li>
  <li>Ensure any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases are managed in line with the sport’s COVID-19 case management protocols and relevant government guidance.  You can see further advice on managing cases in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#cases">section on cases and outbreaks</a> below.</li>
  <li>Set appropriate protocols for the return of athletes and staff following self-isolation or suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19, and how they should be medically assessed. Have medical oversight of the return of athletes, including a check-up before re-engaging in any training or competition.</li>
  <li>Determine what level of monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms or testing for COVID-19 is required, and how any regular screening for COVID-19 symptoms will take place. Screening should include a questionnaire as a minimum.</li>
  <li>Oversee testing and symptom screening requirements. Regular screening for symptoms within the training environment may be carried out by an appropriately trained healthcare professional working with a set of protocols defined in the risk assessment mitigation plan and signed off by the medical officer.</li>
  <li>Ensure an appropriate level of medical staffing is in place to manage any injuries and illness, alongside additional measures such as COVID-19 symptom screening.</li>
  <li>Ensure that staff receive appropriate training. For example, those working at a sport event should familiarise themselves with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov" class="govuk-link">guidance for first responders</a>, in case of emergency situations.</li>
  <li>Consider whether personal protective equipment (PPE) is required, and ensure it is available where appropriate (and that relevant staff are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">trained in appropriate usage and disposal</a>). You can see further advice on PPE below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 medical officer should consider whether personal protective equipment (PPE) is required for relevant staff, taking into account the following guidance. This should be considered through your risk assessment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where close face-to-face contact is required, the COVID-19 medical officer may decide that medical personnel and patients should wear face coverings. This is particularly important when they are conducting treatments which require them to be in close proximity to a person’s face, mouth and nose.</li>
  <li>Where there is a greater risk of exposure to the virus, they may recommend the use of PPE such as visors or specific types of face masks to protect the practitioner’s eyes, mouth and nose (for example, for practitioners who need to work in close contact with potentially symptomatic individuals, or for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov" class="govuk-link">first responders</a> in emergency situations).</li>
  <li>You should consider the guidance on where face coverings, which details when face coverings should legally be worn and when they are exempt.</li>
  <li>In most other cases, PPE would not be required, except where it is normally used in your work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks.</li>
  <li>If your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly. You should ensure that relevant staff are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">trained in their appropriate usage and disposal</a> of PPE.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Cases and outbreaks</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 medical officer should work with the COVID-19 officer to ensure they have appropriate protocols for managing cases or outbreaks of COVID-19. This should be set out in your risk register, and should include the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring that all NHS Test and Trace protocols are followed.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that any workers, visitors or athletes who have symptoms or who have tested positive leave the facility immediately to self-isolate.</li>
  <li>Where possible, the individual being assessed on-site by the COVID-19 medical officer (or another medical professional following the protocols set by the COVID-19 medical officer).</li>
  <li>Informing your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">local authority public health team</a>. Where possible, nominate a single point of contact to lead on contacting local public health teams. </li>
  <li>Ensuring your facility is thoroughly cleaned. Follow the measures set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are organising an event with spectators, review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a> and ensure you include appropriate protocols for managing cases in spectators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Sports, clubs and support service providers</h2>

<p>It is considered good practice for sport organisations, clubs and support service providers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clearly communicate that any individual involved with an elite sport training environment and/or competition has the right to ‘opt out’ of these activities at any time, highlighting that no unreasonable steps will be taken against them as a consequence.</li>
  <li>Ensure athletes and staff are aware of any relevant guidance or safety measures in place, such as training protocols, cleaning and hygiene measures at facilities, or competition requirements. Clearly communicate any changes to protocols or requirements.</li>
  <li>Ensure that you have appropriate insurance cover, and that any support staff within the training environment are operating to the minimum standards of practice required by any professional body endorsement and professional indemnity insurances.</li>
  <li>Consider any additional risks that may affect athletes or staff who are more at risk of being infected with COVID-19 or have a higher risk of serious illness.</li>
  <li>Consider how any measures you put in place will affect staff with protected characteristics, and any adjustments you should make to take account of your duties under the equalities legislation. Discuss with disabled workers and athletes what reasonable adjustments can be made so they can work, train and participate safely in the training or competition environment. Where relevant, consider whether you should take any additional actions to support Paralympic athletes who need support with complex impairments.</li>
  <li>Be aware of, and focus on, the importance of mental health during the pandemic recovery. Ensure that the mental wellbeing of athletes and staff is taken into account as well as their physical health. Review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-mental-health-and-wellbeing-aspects-of-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of COVID-19</a> and consider how best to provide support to athletes and staff.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Face coverings</h3>

<p>It is now a legal requirement to wear face coverings in most indoor public places and indoor areas of public transport, including but not limited to indoor sports stadia and indoor areas of open-air stadia (e.g. concourses).</p>

<p>Face coverings are not required to be worn in sport and exercise facilities such as gyms, or when taking part in strenuous activity, such as exercise or sport including training and competitions. You should review the guidance on where face coverings must be worn.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are also legally required to make sure all people are aware that they must wear face coverings in these areas (where there is no applicable exemption or reasonable excuse) by displaying signage or taking other measures. You should also review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> if you are organising an event with spectators.</li>
  <li>There are some circumstances where people cannot do their work effectively while wearing a face covering. These people are not required to wear a face covering while they are working. This includes elite athletes and coaches, professional dancers and choreographers, and sport officials like referees, when they are participating in competitions, events and training activities. Further information can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a>.</li>
  <li>Athletes and support staff should consider wearing face coverings in training and competition venues or events, when not participating in sporting activities. You should advise them to follow the competition or facility’s guidance where possible and appropriate.</li>
  <li>People in your organisation may also choose to wear a face covering in areas where it is not legally required. It is an offence to prevent, or seek to prevent, a person from wearing a face covering where legally required (unless it is required to verify their identity or provide them with medical support). This prohibition extends to some exempt areas as well, including hospitality and exercise facilities. You should also ensure they are aware of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">guidance on using face coverings safely</a>.</li>
  <li>Venue operators/competition organisers and organisations which are employers can also choose to ask their staff or customers to wear face coverings as a safety measure, even in areas where it is not legally required. When deciding whether you will choose to ask that people wear face coverings:
    <ul>
      <li>You need to consider the reasonable adjustments needed for workers and customers with disabilities. You also need to carefully consider how this fits with other obligations to workers and customers arising from e.g. employment rights, health and safety laws and equality legislation.</li>
      <li><strong>You should not ask people to wear face coverings while they are taking part in any strenuous activity or sport.</strong></li>
      <li>Remember that some people are not able to wear face coverings, and the reasons for this may not be visible to others. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances. Be aware that face coverings may make it harder to communicate with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you are organising an event with spectators, review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a> for further advice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>NHS QR Code</h3>

<p>Facility/venue operators should consider displaying an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code poster</a> so that people can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are no longer required to collect customer contact details, or keep a record of your staff and visitors.</li>
  <li>However, you are advised to continue to display an NHS QR code for people wishing to check in using the app, as this will help to reduce the spread of the virus and protect your athletes, visitors and staff. <strong>You do not have to ask people to check in, or turn them away if they refuse.</strong>
</li>
  <li>If you display an NHS QR code, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details, for those who ask to check in but who do not have access to a smartphone or who prefer not to use the app.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Cleaning / hygiene protocols</h3>

<p>Facility/venue operators should put in place cleaning protocols for the facility, which meet government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a> as a minimum.</p>

<p>Cleaning protocols should include provision for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Routine cleaning of all areas accessed by elite athletes, support staff and facilities staff at the beginning and end of the training day,</strong> paying particular attention to high-traffic areas and surfaces that are touched regularly, such as door handles, lift buttons and handrails.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Routine and thorough cleaning of all spectator areas where these are in use,</strong> including seating, concourse areas and toilets, including between each competition session. Particular attention should be paid to frequent touch-points such as doors, door handles, seat arms, handrails and taps. There is further guidance on management of spectators in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance on events and attractions</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Frequently cleaning of higher-risk areas, such as toilet facilities, changing rooms and showers,</strong> during the day and at the end of the day. Hosts/venue operators should set clear use and cleaning guidance to ensure these areas are kept clean, including putting up a visible and up-to-date cleaning schedule. Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks. Water fountains should be frequently cleaned, and only used to fill personal bottles (you should advise against face-to-tap drinking).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Deep-cleaning where required,</strong> such as after higher-risk activity in enclosed spaces, or where the area/equipment has been used by someone who later reports COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test. If you are cleaning after a known or suspected case of COVID-19, follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance on cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Any additional cleaning needs identified through your risk register,</strong> or in consultation with venues, competition organisers or other sport organisations.
    <ul>
      <li>This could include cleaning relevant areas or shared equipment between sessions for different groups of athletes, which should be agreed in advance with the relevant groups. Where users are expected to clean gym equipment (such as fixed machines, free weights and large equipment handles), the host/venue operator should place visible notices to remind them to do so, and ensure they have the materials they will need (such as sprays and paper towels).</li>
      <li>This could also include equipment being brought into the training venue (such as specialist technical equipment or wheelchairs).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleaning of clinical areas should meet any relevant standards set by Public Health England. This should be discussed with the COVID-19 medical officer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Put in place hygiene measures to reduce the risk of transmission. This should include providing handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser,</strong> particularly in high-traffic or higher-risk areas, such as concourse areas, doorways, lifts and bathroom facilities. This could include placing hand sanitiser stations at the entrances of different buildings or areas within your event site.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure handwashing facilities or hand sanitiser stations are available near shared facilities, equipment and objects.</strong> For example, at the entrance and exit of toilet facilities, and near food/drink kiosks.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that handwashing and hand sanitiser facilities are checked and refilled regularly,</strong> and that any equipment placed is accessible to (and does not impede) wheelchair users.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Maintain good hygiene practices, such as encouraging staff and customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands regularly.</strong> You could use signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing techniques, the need to increase handwashing frequency, and good hygiene practices (like avoiding touching your face, and coughing or sneezing into your arm). Consider how to ensure safety messages reach those with hearing or vision impairments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Ventilation</h3>

<p>Ventilation plays an important role in reducing the risk of aerosol (airborne) transmission of COVID-19. Use your risk assessment to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to make sure there is an adequate supply of fresh air in your workplace. This is particularly important for indoor spaces where there are people present. <a class="govuk-link" href="#ventilation-1">Read about improving ventilation</a>.</li>
  <li>Finding out if there are areas of your workplace which don’t have enough ventilation, and how you can improve fresh air flow in these areas. <a class="govuk-link" href="#ventilation-2">Read about poorly ventilated spaces</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improving ventilation</h4>

<p>Good ventilation brings fresh air into indoor spaces. The more fresh air that is brought inside, the more it will dilute any virus particles in the air. In spaces which don’t have enough ventilation, virus particles can remain in the air after an infected person has left and increase the risk of COVID-19 spreading.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external">Watch a video from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which explains how ventilation reduces the risk of transmission</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure there is an adequate supply of fresh air in your workplace. This can be natural ventilation (opening windows, doors and vents), mechanical ventilation (fans and ducts), or a combination of both. It’s particularly important to keep toilets and showers well-ventilated, as these can be areas of higher risk.</p>

<p><strong>How to improve natural ventilation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Open doors, windows and air vents where possible.</li>
  <li>Opening doors and windows even for a brief period can help to refresh the air and reduce COVID-19 particles.</li>
  <li>Opening the windows and doors fully will let the most fresh air into the space.</li>
  <li>Encourage people to use outside space where it’s practical, especially for higher-risk activities such as exercise, or when people are singing or raising their voices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to improve mechanical ventilation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that your systems are set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation.</li>
  <li>It’s not advised to recirculate air from one space to another. Systems which recirculate air from one space to another are likely to increase the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>Recirculation units that do not bring in fresh air can remain in operation as long as there is an alternative supply of fresh air.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heritage locations should take care to increase ventilation in a way which does not endanger historic items. Doors and windows can be propped open if they do not cause an environmental, collection, safety, fire or security risk.</p>

<p><strong>Ventilation and workplace temperature</strong></p>

<p>Providing adequate ventilation does not mean people have to work in an uncomfortably cold workplace.</p>

<p>There are steps you can take to make sure your workplace is adequately ventilated without being too cold, such as partially opening windows and doors and opening higher-level windows.</p>

<h4>Identify and manage poorly ventilated spaces</h4>

<p>It’s important to find out if there are poorly ventilated areas of your workplace that are usually occupied by people (workers or customers), so you can increase the flow of fresh air.</p>

<p><strong>How to identify poorly ventilated spaces</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Look for areas where people are usually present for an extended period of time, and where there is no mechanical ventilation and no natural ventilation (such as open windows, vents or doors).</li>
  <li>Use a carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitor to measure the level of ventilation (see below for more information). In an an area or room people are using, an average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of above 1500ppm indicates that it is poorly ventilated.</li>
  <li><strong>You should take action to improve ventilation where CO<sub>2</sub> readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider factors which may increase the risk</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>In a poorly ventilated space, the risk of COVID-19 transmission will increase where there are more virus particles being released into the air.</li>
  <li>When identifying poorly ventilated spaces, you should pay particular attention to areas of high occupancy (which are used by a larger number of people) and which are used for extended periods of time, as these factors will increase the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>You should also consider how the space is used. Some activities can increase the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19. This happens where people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe heavily, such as singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices.</li>
  <li><strong>Where there is continuous talking or singing, or high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercise), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels below 800ppm is recommended.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>What you should do<br><br>
</h4>

<p>If your risk assessment shows that there are poorly ventilated areas in your workplace, it’s important that you improve the ventilation to reduce the risk of COVID-19 being spread in these areas.</p>

<p>Follow the steps above to improve ventilation (internal link) by opening doors, windows and vents, if possible, and by ensuring that any mechanical ventilation system is set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation.</p>

<p>If these options are not available or do not provide sufficient ventilation (for example, if CO<sub>2</sub> readings remain above recommended levels, or the room continues to feel stuffy), you can think about other ways to reduce the risk in these spaces.</p>

<p><strong>Think about changing the way these spaces are used. For example, you could:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Restrict the number of people who can use the space at the same time.</li>
  <li>Restrict the length of time people spend in the space.</li>
  <li>Move activities which involve exercising, dancing or raising voices (singing, shouting or talking loudly) to an area with better ventilation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Think about ways to increase mechanical ventilation.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask a ventilation engineer to check the performance of your mechanical ventilation system, especially if it hasn’t been serviced recently.</li>
  <li>Install a mechanical ventilation system, if you don’t have mechanical ventilation or if the existing system does not provide fresh air.</li>
  <li>Install an air cleaning or filtration unit. Air cleaning or filtration is not a substitute for good ventilation. But where poor ventilation cannot be improved in other ways, a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or ultraviolet air purifier could help to reduce the number of COVID-19 particles in the air. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/air-cleaning-and-filtration-units.htm">Read HSE’s advice on air cleaning and filtration devices</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors to identify poorly ventilated spaces</strong></p>

<p><strong>Using Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors</strong><br>
People exhale carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) when they breathe out. If there is a build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> in an area it can indicate that ventilation needs improving.</p>

<p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> levels are not a direct measure of possible exposure to COVID-19, checking levels using a monitor can help you identify poorly ventilated areas. <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/identifying-poorly-ventilated-areas.htm" class="govuk-link">Read HSE advice on how to use a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How the measurements can help you take action</strong><br>
CO<sub>2</sub> measurements should be used as a broad guide to ventilation rather than treating them as safe thresholds.</p>

<p>Outdoor levels are around 400ppm (parts per million of carbon dioxide). Indoors, a consistent CO<sub>2</sub> value less than 800ppm is likely to indicate that a space is well-ventilated.</p>

<p>A CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of above 1500ppm when a room is occupied is an indicator of poor ventilation. You should take action to improve ventilation where CO<sub>2</sub> readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.</p>

<p>Where there is continuous talking or singing, or high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercising), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels below 800ppm is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Where CO<sub>2</sub> monitors can help</strong><br>
CO<sub>2</sub> monitors can be used to check ventilation in a wide range of settings.</p>

<p>In large areas such as concert halls or event spaces, multiple sensors may be required to provide meaningful information.</p>

<p>There are some spaces where CO<sub>2</sub> monitors are less likely to provide useful readings. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Areas occupied by people for short periods or for varying amounts of time. For example, a railway station or an atrium.</li>
  <li>Areas where air cleaning units are in use. Filtration can remove contaminants (such as COVID-19) from the air but will not remove CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
  <li>Spaces like changing rooms, toilets or small meeting rooms.</li>
  <li>Spaces used by low numbers of people.</li>
  <li>Areas where CO<sub>2</sub> is produced as part of a work process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/identifying-poorly-ventilated-areas.htm" class="govuk-link" rel="external">HSE advice on the suitability of CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring in different types of space</a>. Where CO<sub>2</sub> monitors cannot be used, you should still identify poorly ventilated spaces and provide adequate ventilation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Competition environments</h2>

<p>Elite sport competitions are typically delivered in partnership by multiple organisations and delivery models can be complex. There may be crossover in responsibilities between the competition delivery partners and elite sport organisations. All user groups should work collectively to ensure that competitions can be staged safely.</p>

<p>If you are planning events with spectators (or hosting other events open to visitors in your facility) you should review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out further advice on managing spectators. There is advice on the types of measures you can take to reduce risk at events, and a risk management template to help you plan your event. You should also consider whether your event or venue meets the criteria for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event" class="govuk-link">mandatory COVID status checks</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The competition delivery partners should regularly consult with the Safety Advisory Group, local authority and and local UKHSA representatives,</strong> to understand the prevailing risk environment and assess if the competition can be safely hosted. There is more detailed advice on working with local authorities and other partners in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" class="govuk-link">guidance for events and attractions</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to competition, competition delivery partners should ensure that the following minimum standards are in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement over the roles and responsibilities and command, control and coordination arrangements between the competition delivery partners and the elite sport organisation(s).</li>
  <li>A decision-making structure and agreed procedure in place to modify, restrict, postpone or cancel the competition, should this be required or indicated by government guidance or public health data/developments.</li>
  <li>Any measures required to comply with government/PHE guidelines (relating to sport-specific rules, technical requirements or equipment) are agreed and put in place by the national/international governing body for that sport.</li>
  <li>Where the competition organiser and venue operator are not the same person, those two parties should enter into a venue-use agreement to ensure that all relevant matters (including those set out in this guidance) are appropriately addressed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Cross-border competition</h2>

<p>Elite sport competitions are typically delivered in partnership by multiple organisations and delivery models can be complex. There may be crossover in responsibilities between the competition delivery partners and elite sport organisations. Complexity is increased in cross-border competition, when international elite sport organisations, international federations and other international user groups are introduced to the competition environment.</p>

<p>All user groups should work collectively to ensure that the competition can be staged safely. The roles, responsibilities, and command/control/coordination arrangements between the competition delivery partners and the elite sport organisation(s) should be agreed at the outset, including consideration of the role of the international federation(s), where appropriate, and any requirements of international elite sport organisations or individuals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Hosting cross-border elite sports events in England</h3>

<p>In addition to the considerations for elite sport competition (set out above, and in the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions</a>), competition delivery partners and elite sport organisations should make early contact with the international elite sport organisations/individuals, international federations (where appropriate) and other international user groups to discuss:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The current COVID-19 situation in the UK (including risk levels and government policy), and how this may impact entry to the UK/England, planned accommodation, training, transportation, and match fixtures. If you are concerned about the impact of self-isolation or quarantine requirements, see the sections on <a class="govuk-link" href="#listing">listing events as specified competitions</a> and <a href="#internationaltravel" class="govuk-link">international travel</a> for further advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether spectators/visitors will be required to provide evidence of their COVID status.

</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 plans and policies of national governing bodies (or their equivalents) of visiting international sportspersons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current COVID-19 regulations and guidance, and any implications they may have on international attendees’ medical requirements, or cultural, language, religious or vulnerability considerations which should be taken into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirement for international attendees to have in place appropriate medical insurance and/or funding to cover their medical needs outside the NHS. This should include routine medical and performance-related healthcare such as musculoskeletal injuries, including outpatient investigation. Insurance must include COVID-19 care if reciprocal home country arrangements do not apply. This should include the whole delegation for the duration of their stay in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel arrangements to the UK, including: <br><br> - The country of embarkation of international user groups and any requirements (such as visas, screening or isolation) to enter the UK. <br><br> - All countries that the individual(s) have been in within the 10 days preceding entry, and any relevant measures that will need to be taken (such as testing and quarantine). <br><br> - Travel and transit through international airports and specific COVID-19 risks associated with this. <br><br> - Procedures for arrivals/departures, and ground transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any equipment (sporting or non-sporting) that will be required to deliver the competition and will be imported from outside the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Planning for international travel to elite sport outside the UK</h3>

<p>Key points to consider for domestic elite sports organisations, sportspersons and essential operational or support staff travelling to competition or training outside the UK.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">international travel guidance</a>.</strong> Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice</a> for countries you plan to travel to, which sets out guidance on COVID-19 and other factors you should be aware of if you travel abroad. Review FCDO advice regularly prior to travel to ensure that any changes to measures can be incorporated into your plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure you are aware of relevant guidance for the country you travel to.</strong> Individuals and organisations must comply with the entry requirements of countries they travel to, including any quarantine or testing laws or guidance. The COVID-19 Officer and COVID-19 Medical Officer responsible for the elite sport organisation or individual(s) should liaise with the organisers of the competition in the early stages of planning, to ensure they are aware of any relevant exemptions or conditions for participating athletes, support staff or others travelling for the competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure those travelling are aware of relevant laws and guidance.</strong> The travelling athletes and support staff will be expected to abide by the laws and guidelines of the host country and organisation for the duration of their stay in the host country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Put in place protocols for managing cases of COVID-19 in the travelling party.</strong> The competition should have measures in place to follow in competition settings. Work with your COVID-19 Medical Officer to establish steps to take if athletes or staff develop symptoms and/or test positive in other settings (e.g. during travel). This should involve the relevant individual(s) isolating the relevant individual(s), maintaining appropriate contact tracing procedures, and planning their return to the UK when it is safe to do so (in line with travel and public health guidelines in the UK and in the country in which they are competing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for your return to the UK.</strong> Plan for your return to the UK. Take into account the relevant laws and guidance for entering the UK, such as testing and quarantine measures that may apply. The exemptions to self-isolation requirements for elite sport only apply to specific events and individuals, and cannot be used in other circumstances. Read the sections on <a href="#internationaltravel" class="govuk-link">international travel</a> and <a href="#exemptions" class="govuk-link">elite sport exemptions</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider post-travel arrangements for returning to sport and work.</strong> When athletes and staff are back in the UK (and have completed any quarantine requirements), they should return to following your sport’s protocols.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Listing of specified competitions and notification of events to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS)</h3>

<p>Competition organisers may seek to be listed as a ‘specified competition’ where, subject to meeting strict criteria, accredited attendees may be exempt from self-isolation requirements to enable them to participate in or help deliver the specified competition. These competitions have to be listed in the International Travel Regulations (“the Regulations”) before an exemption can apply.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the competition organiser to agree any listing of their event as a specified competition directly with the UK government, by contacting the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:elitesportexemptions@dcms.gov.uk">elitesportexemptions@dcms.gov.uk</a>). <strong>This must be done at least 6 weeks in advance of the event,</strong> to allow for consideration of the request and amending the legislation (if agreed) so that the event becomes a specified competition for the purposes of the Regulations. As part of this process, competition organisers must seek approval of their infection control protocols directly from the UK Health Security Agency (contact details will be provided by DCMS).</p>

<p>National governing bodies and event organisers routinely report to DCMS the number of exemptions they have issued for elite sports events and elite sportspersons. Those who are considering issuing an exemption who do not already report on this should contact DCMS (<a href="mailto:elitesportexemptions@dcms.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">elitesportexemptions@dcms.gov.uk</a>) so that they can be added to the reporting cycle.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>International travel - self-isolation and exemptions</h2>

<p>This section relates to the rules for entering England from overseas. If you are travelling to another part of the UK, you should check the relevant guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/pages/red-amber-and-green-list-countries/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a href="https://gov.wales/rules-foreign-travel-and-wales-coronavirus-covid-19-html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Wales</a> or <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>People arriving in England from abroad must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">complete a passenger locator form</a> and follow different rules depending on whether they qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England. Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">international travel guidance</a> for more information on who qualifies as fully vaccinated, and what you need to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>People who are not fully vaccinated under an approved programme</strong> (or are exempt from this requirement, for example because they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons) need to quarantine for 10 days after they arrive in England and take tests before they travel and during their quarantine. They can quarantine in a private residence, or in a hotel or other guest accommodation facility. In some circumstances, different rules (known as ‘exemptions’) apply to elite athletes and essential support or operational staff. You can find more information in the section on <a href="#exemptions" class="govuk-link">elite sport exemptions</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>People who are fully vaccinated under an approved programme</strong> are not required to take a COVID-19 test before they travel to England, or to quarantine when they arrive (unless they have a positive result on a COVID-19 test). Before they travel, they are required to book a COVID-19 test (<abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> or rapid lateral flow test) to take when they are in England. They can take the test any time between arriving in England (day 0) and the end of day 2. If they have a positive result on a rapid lateral flow test, they must self-isolate and take a <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> test to confirm the result. If they have a negative result on a <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> test, they do not need to self-isolate.

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Elite sport exemptions</h3>

<p>In some circumstances, different rules (known as ‘exemptions’) apply to elite athletes and essential support or operational staff, including how they should self-isolate if they are required to. This is in recognition that public health risks associated with these events will be very low, as a result of meticulous planning and mitigation strategies, effectively operating so far as possible within a distinct bubble of those involved in the competition, and within a distinct event footprint made up of the event venues and other relevant locations (such as athlete accommodation facilities).</p>

<p>These exemptions are relevant to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Travel from or through red list countries or territories (for <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/11" class="govuk-link">Schedule 11</a> events only).</li>
  <li>Travel from or through all other countries (for <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/5" class="govuk-link">Schedule 5</a> events) for international elite sportspersons; or for elite sport activities, such as training and competition, for domestic elite sportspersons).</li>
</ul>

<p>These exemptions apply differently to athletes and staff depending on whether they are <a class="govuk-link" href="#international">international athletes and essential staff travelling to compete in the UK</a>, or <a class="govuk-link" href="#domestic">domestic (UK) athletes</a> based in the UK or overseas. Review the relevant section(s) below for more information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Exemption for international (non-UK) sportspersons travelling to compete in the UK</h3>

<p>International elite sportspersons and essential organisational or support staff (e.g. coaches, medical and technical staff, and essential broadcast staff for the event) who are attending certain types of event listed in the Regulations can isolate within the event footprint, provided they comply with certain conditions.</p>

<p>This exemption applies to people who do not qualify under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">fully vaccinated rules for travel to England</a> and so would normally be required to quarantine when they arrive in England. This exemption allows them to leave self-isolation when they take part in the relevant activities of the event, isolating instead with other elite sportspersons and essential support or operational staff involved in the event as part of the event footprint.</p>

<p>There are two lists of competitions, and the exemptions that apply depend on the countries the relevant individuals have travelled from or through.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/11" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><strong>Events listed in Schedule 11 of the Regulations</strong></a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Schedule 11 events, international athletes and essential staff travelling from or through red list countries or territories do not have to enter managed quarantine, provided they comply with the relevant conditions set out below. If they cannot comply with these conditions, they must follow the requirements which would otherwise apply, including entering a managed quarantine hotel for 10 full days.</li>
</ul>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/5"><strong>Events listed under Schedule 5 of the Regulations</strong></a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Schedule 5 events, international athletes and essential staff travelling from non-red list countries can use this exemption to isolate within the event footprint (i.e within the event’s facilities, including hotels or other accommodation used for the event).</li>
  <li>This means that international athletes and essential staff who would usually be required to self-isolate can isolate within the event footprint so they can take part in the competition as part of the competition ‘bubble’. In order to use this exemption, individuals must comply with the relevant conditions set out below. If they cannot comply with these conditions, they must follow the requirements which would otherwise apply.</li>
  <li>This exemption does not apply to red list countries or territories. People who have been in a country or territory on the red list (in the 10 days preceding their arrival in England) cannot use this exemption. They must follow the requirements which would otherwise apply, including entering a managed quarantine hotel for 10 full days, unless the event is also listed in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/11" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schedule 11 of the Regulations</a> and the person complies with the applicable conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Relevant conditions which must be followed</strong></p>

<p>For these exemptions to apply, the individual(s) are required to stay within the footprint of the listed elite sports event. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going directly to, and staying within, the relevant event location(s), which may include provision of hotel or other suitable accommodation. If the event has multiple venues, they can travel between those locations.</li>
  <li>Self-isolating when not attending relevant activities. For example, staying away from others they did not travel with when in the event accommodation.
    <ul>
      <li>It is recommended that individual(s) only leave self-isolation to attend relevant activities once they have received a negative result on their Day 2 <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> test. In exceptional or critical circumstances where the individual(s) must leave self-isolation before this point (for example, for work activity which could not be re-arranged), they should take a rapid lateral flow test and check that the result is negative before leaving self-isolation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When attending relevant activities (such as training and competition), staying within the event footprint, isolating with other elite sportspersons and essential support or operational staff involved in the event.</li>
  <li>If the individual(s) stay somewhere other than the event footprint (e.g. if they own a residence in England) they must self-isolate in that place when they are not within the event footprint. They are allowed to travel between that location and the event, subject to any additional protocols imposed by the event organiser.</li>
</ul>

<p>These conditions apply until their departure from England or for the period they would otherwise be in self-isolation.</p>

<p><strong>How to qualify for a Schedule 5 or Schedule 11 exemption</strong></p>

<p>In order to qualify for this exemption, the event must be listed in Schedule 5 or Schedule 11 of the Travel Regulations. The relevant individual(s) must provide written evidence from the UK or England national governing body for their sport, confirming that they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an international elite sportsperson <strong>or</strong> essential ancillary organisational or support staff (e.g. coaches, medical and technical staff, and essential broadcast staff for the event); <strong>and</strong>
</li>
  <li>attending a competition listed in the Regulations.</li>

<span class="number">10.3 </span>Exemption for domestic (UK) sportspersons travelling to or returning to the UK</h3>

<p>Domestic athletes and support/operational staff travelling or returning to the UK who do not qualify under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#check-if-you-qualify-as-fully-vaccinated">fully vaccinated rules for travel</a> are required to quarantine when they arrive in England, but are sometimes permitted to self-isolate in a different way to the general public.</p>

<p>They can leave self-isolation to attend elite sport activities such as training or competition, provided they follow the relevant conditions. There are different rules for relevant athletes and staff, depending on whether they are based in the UK or overseas.</p>

<p>This exemption will only be needed by those who travel from non-red list countries and are required to self-isolate when they enter the UK (people who do not qualify as fully vaccinated). It is not needed if they have only travelled from or through the common travel area (the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) as there is no requirement to self-isolate.</p>

<p>This exemption does not apply if they have been in a country or territory on the red list in the 10 days before their arrival. In that case, they must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">follow the requirements for arrivals from red list countries</a>, including quarantining in a managed quarantine hotel, unless they are participating in an event which is listed under <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/11">Schedule 11 of the Regulations</a>.</p>

<div class="example">
<h4>Domestic sportspersons based in the UK</h4>

<p>This exemption applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK elite athletes, who are returning to England from competing in an elite sports event overseas, or participating in training for the Beijing or Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games.</li>
  <li>Staff providing essential support to the team or athlete (such as medical and technical support staff, horse grooms and trainers, motorsport mechanics, and the parent/carer of a relevant athlete under the age of 18) at such an event.</li>
  <li>Operational staff essential to the running of an elite sports event (such as event officials, referees and broadcast staff/journalists).</li>
</ul>

<p>If people in these groups are required to self-isolate on their return to England, this exemption permits them to leave self-isolation for certain exempt activities.</p>

<p>These activities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>competing in or training for an elite sports event;</li>
  <li>providing essential support to a domestic elite sportsperson in their competition or training; or</li>
  <li>providing essential operational support to the running of an elite sports event.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where they need to leave self-isolation to attend elite sport activities such as training or competition, they must travel directly to or between the locations of elite sports events or training, and stay within the event footprint (isolating with the athletes and support staff involved in the event).</p>

<p>It is recommended that individual(s) only leave self-isolation to attend relevant activities once they have received a negative result on their Day 2 PCR test. In exceptional or critical circumstances where the individual(s) must leave self-isolation before this point (for example, for work activity which could not be re-arranged) the individual should take a rapid lateral flow test and check that the result is negative before leaving self-isolation.</p>

<p>This exemption is conditional and only applies while they are engaging in these elite sport activities. When not taking part in these activities, they are required to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">self-isolation rules which would otherwise apply</a>. Individuals using this exemption are also able to opt-in to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel" class="govuk-link">Test to Release scheme</a>.</p>

<p><strong>In order to qualify for this exemption, the relevant individual(s) must provide written evidence from the UK or England national governing body for their sport, confirming:</strong></p>

<p>a) their status as a UK elite sportsperson (or essential operational or support staff) who has travelled overseas to train for or participate in an elite sports event; <strong>and</strong>
(b) that they will be continuing those activities on their return.</p>

<h4>Domestic sportspersons based overseas</h4>

<p>This exemption applies to UK elite sportspersons based overseas. It does not apply to support or operational staff based overseas.</p>

<p>If UK elite sportspersons based overseas are required to self-isolate on their return to England, this exemption permits them to leave self-isolation for certain exempt activities such as training or competition.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Summary: international athletes/staff travelling to compete in the UK</h2>

<p>This section provides a summary of the rules that apply to international elite sportspersons and essential support or operational staff who are travelling from overseas for competitions in the UK. This guidance relates to arrivals in England. If you arrive in a different part of the UK, you should check the relevant guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/pages/red-amber-and-green-list-countries/" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/rules-foreign-travel-and-wales-coronavirus-covid-19-html">Wales</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Self-isolation requirements</strong></p>

<p>Check if you qualify as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England</a>. Your vaccination status will determine whether you are required to self-isolate when you travel to England from a non-red list country.</p>

<p>If you are travelling to competitions that are listed in Schedule 5 or 11 of the Regulations, the elite sport exemption may apply. This means that you can isolate in a different way to other people travelling to the UK, which allows you to take part in your event, provided you comply with certain conditions, such as staying within the event footprint. You should check whether your event is listed in the Regulations to find out whether you may be exempt from any quarantine requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Red list</strong> - if you have been in a country or territory on the red list in the 10 days prior to your arrival:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Specified competitions (Schedule 11):</strong> if your event is listed under <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/11">Schedule 11 of the Regulations</a> the exemption will apply, provided you comply with the conditions in the box below.</li>
  <li>
<strong>All other events:</strong> if your event is not listed under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/11" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schedule 11 of the Regulations</a>, you should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">rules for arrivals from red list countries</a>. Entry to the UK is restricted to British and Irish Nationals, or those with residence rights in the UK, who must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/booking-and-staying-in-a-quarantine-hotel-when-you-arrive-in-england" class="govuk-link">book and stay in a managed quarantine hotel</a>. This applies regardless of your vaccination status.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All other countries</strong> - if you have not been in a country or territory on the red list in the 10 days prior to your arrival:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Specified competitions (Schedule 5):</strong> If your event is listed under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/5" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Schedule 5 of the Regulations</a>, the exemption will apply.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Non-specified competitions:</strong> if your event is not listed under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/582/schedule/5" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Schedule 5 of the Regulations</a>, the exemption will not apply. You must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">rules for travel to England</a> including quarantine for the appropriate amount of time before you can leave self-isolation (including to participate in elite sport events).</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Competitions that qualify for exemptions (through listing in Schedule 5 or 11 of the Regulations) - what you must do</strong></p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">international travel guidance</a> to find out the rules you will need to follow when travelling to England.</p>

<p>When travelling for a qualifying competition, to benefit from the relevant exemption you must provide written evidence from the UK or England national governing body for your sport, confirming that you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an international elite sportsperson <strong>or</strong> essential ancillary organisational or support staff (e.g. coaches, medical and technical staff, and essential broadcast staff for the event); <strong>and</strong>
</li>
  <li>attending a specified competition listed in the Regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When you are in England, you must:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Stay within the footprint of the listed elite sports event.</strong> This means going directly to, and staying within, the relevant event location(s), which may include provision of hotel or other suitable accommodation. If the event has multiple venues, you can travel between these locations.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Self-isolate when you are not attending relevant activities.</strong> For example, staying away from others you did not travel with when in the event accommodation. It is recommended that you only leave self-isolation to attend relevant activities once you have received a negative result on your Day 2 PCR test. If you must leave self-isolation before this point (for example, for work activity which could not be re-arranged) you should take a rapid lateral flow test and check that the result is negative before leaving self-isolation.</li>
  <li>
<strong>When attending relevant activities (such as training and competition), staying within the event bubble,</strong> isolating with other elite sportspersons and essential support or operational staff involved in the event.</li>
  <li>If you are staying somewhere other than the event footprint (e.g. if you own a residence in England) you must self-isolate in this place when you are not within the event footprint. You are allowed to travel between this location and the event, subject to any additional protocols imposed by the event organiser.</li>
  <li><strong>These conditions apply until your departure from the UK or for the period you would otherwise be in self-isolation.</strong></li>
