<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document sets out a recommended framework for the operation of elite sport. It sets out guidance for elite sport organisations on how to reduce the risk from COVID-19 for athletes, coaches, support staff, and other members of the elite sport operational structure. This includes guidance for UK-based elite sports organisations and individuals travelling to competition or training outside the UK.</p>

<p>It is supplemented by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which outlines how competition delivery partners and venues should plan and manage sporting events with spectators.</p>

<p>This guidance does not constitute legal advice or replace any other government or UKHSA advice; nor does it provide any commentary or advice on health-related issues. Any relevant government and guidance on public health measures will take precedence over any other standards (such as competition standards set by international competition organisers, international federations or governments), unless otherwise specified.</p>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Key principles</h2>

<p><strong>Sport organisations, venue operators and competition organisers can take the following steps to protect against COVID-19:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Complete a risk assessment that includes risks from COVID-19.</strong> For venue operators and other employers, this is an obligation under health and safety law. For sport organisations which are not employers, this is good practice which will help you to understand the risks relevant to your organisation and any steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Your risk assessment should consider the points below in the rest of this guidance. It should also take into account any reasonable adjustments needed for staff and customers with disabilities. It is considered good practice to nominate a COVID-19 officer to lead your COVID-19 risk assessment and put in place risk mitigation and appropriate protocols. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#risk">section on risk assessments</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider appointing a named COVID-19 medical officer</strong> to set protocols for infection management, medical cover and equipment, and oversee testing/symptom screening requirements and return of athletes following illness. This will depend on the size of your organisation and the provision you have. It could be an existing medical officer (where you have one) or the responsibility of one of the medical team. The medical officer should work with the COVID-19 officer (where you have one) to inform the medical aspects of the risk register and set appropriate protocols. There is further information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#medical">section on medical protocols</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that appropriate cleaning and hygiene protocols are in place to manage risk.</strong> Review your cleaning and hygiene protocols for training and competition facilities, and put in place any additional safety measures identified by your risk register. You should ask people in your organisation/using your facility to use hand sanitiser and clean their hands frequently, and provide them with advice to promote good hygiene. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#cleaning">section on cleaning and hygiene</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Check that any facilities you use/operate provide adequate ventilation.</strong> You should make sure there is a supply of fresh air to enclosed spaces where there are people present. This can be natural ventilation through windows, doors and vents; mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts; or a combination of both. If you operate a facility or venue, you should identify any poorly ventilated spaces in your premises and consider steps you can take to improve fresh air flow in these areas. In some places, a CO2 monitor can help to identify if the space is poorly ventilated. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#ventilation">section on ventilation</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external">HSE guidance on ventilation and air conditioning during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Consider the impact of athletes or staff being required to isolate</strong> on planned training or competitions, and whether you can put in place any contingency arrangements to minimise disruption. Anyone who tests positive or is notified by NHS Test and Trace that they need to self-isolate must do so. People who are legally required to self-isolate must follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/if-youre-told-to-self-isolate-by-nhs-test-and-trace-or-the-covid-19-app/" rel="external">guidance on self-isolation</a>, even if they have no symptoms and/or are fully vaccinated. Should a known or suspected COVID-19 case occur in the elite environment, or an individual be identified as a contact of a known case, you should follow the protocols set by the COVID-19 medical officer. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#cases">section on cases and outbreaks</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure athletes and staff supporting elite sport are aware of the risks</strong> involved in elite sport activity, mitigating steps being taken and measures they should follow.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider any additional risks that may affect athletes or staff who have a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, or live with people in higher-risk groups.</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>Think about the steps you should take to reduce risks at your facilities, competitions and events</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You may want to display an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code poster</a> so that customers can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app. This will help NHS Test and Trace to reduce the spread of the virus. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#qrcode">NHS QR codes</a>
</li>
      <li>If there will be large crowds at your competitions and events, or people are likely to mix in close contact, you may also want to check the COVID-19 status of attendees and workers, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 being transmitted. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event">COVID-19 status checks</a>.</li>
      <li>You may also want to ask or recommend that people wear face coverings in areas of your event that are crowded and enclosed. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#facecoverings">face coverings</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Review any other relevant guidance for further advice.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are planning events with spectators (or hosting other events open to visitors in your facility) you should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out the points you should consider for events with spectators. This guidance includes advice on the types of measures you can take to reduce risk at events, how you can engage with local authorities and other partners, how you can communicate with customers, and a risk management template you can use to help you plan your event.</li>
      <li>Those operating workplaces should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">guidance on working safely</a> in different types of environments such as offices, retail environments and hospitality facilities.</li>
      <li>National governing bodies and sport providers who also provide grassroots sport should also review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-the-public-and-sport-providers">guidance on grassroots sport</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Risk assessments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Who should do a risk assessment</h3>

<p>Sport organisations, venue operators and other relevant organisations (such as competition delivery partners) should have in place a risk assessment that includes risks from COVID-19. You should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive’s guidance</a> for further information on risk assessments.</p>

<p>You can nominate a COVID-19 officer to lead your COVID-19 risk assessment and put in place risk mitigation and appropriate protocols. A COVID-19 officer would act as the person responsible for oversight of COVID-19 risk assessments and ensuring the necessary level of risk mitigations are in place. This should include any relevant partners, such as the medical officer who will advise on medical protocols. The COVID-19 officer will also coordinate sharing of risk assessments or risk management plans with their organisation, and with partner organisations they work with (e.g. with a competition organiser and venue, ahead of a competition).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Consider designating a member of staff as your COVID-19 officer.</strong> This would include oversight of venues and facilities which are operated by the sport, though they should assess and put in place a suitable structure for their sport. For example, sports may wish to nominate COVID-19 officers for clubs/teams/training groups or venues/facilities they operate, working within the protocols set by the lead COVID-19 officer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Facilities and venues which are not sport-run</strong> may have their own COVID-19 officer responsible for assessing and managing COVID-19 risks.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Where multiple sports/clubs are using the same site(s),</strong> all COVID-19 officers should share their risk assessments and operational plans to ensure alignment and avoid any potential conflict between plans. It may be helpful to appoint a lead COVID-19 officer to manage this process, such as the venue operator’s COVID-19 officer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>When delivering elite sport competitions,</strong> each operating partner should appoint a named COVID-19 officer for every competition in which they have an interest. All COVID-19 officers should share their risk assessments and operational plans to ensure alignment and avoid any potential conflict between plans. It may be helpful to appoint a lead COVID-19 officer to manage this process.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sport organisations which are not employers</strong></p>

<p>For sport organisations which are not employers, doing a risk assessment is good practice which will help you to understand the risks relevant to your organisation and any steps you can take to reduce the risk of COVID-19. You should read the guidance in this section and introduce reasonable measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19. However, this is not a legal requirement unless you are an employer.</p>

<p><strong>Venue operators and other employers</strong></p>

<p>For venue operators and other employers, doing a risk assessment is an obligation under health and safety law. As an employer, by law you must protect workers and others (including contractors, volunteers and customers/users) from risks to their health and safety. This includes risks from COVID-19.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is a workplace hazard. You should manage it in the same way as other workplace hazards. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace</li>
  <li>identifying control measures to manage that risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to.</p>

<p><strong>Failure to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, and put in place control measures to manage the risk of COVID-19 in the workplace, may be considered a breach of health and safety law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consult your workers</strong></p>

<p>As an employer, you have a legal duty to consult workers on health and safety matters. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work they do and how you will manage the risks from COVID-19.</p>

<p>You may do this by consulting with any recognised trade union health and safety representatives. If you do not have any, you can consult with a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be.</p>

<p>Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If you cannot do this, see below for other steps you can take.</p>

<p><strong>Raising concerns</strong></p>

<p>If you’re an employee, you can contact:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your employee representative</li>
  <li>your trade union if you have one</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also contact HSE’s COVID-19 enquiries team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hsegov.microsoftcrmportals.com/workingsafelyenquiries/" rel="external">working safely enquiry form</a>
</li>
  <li>telephone: 0300 790 6787 (Monday to Friday, 8:30am to 5pm)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>

<p>Enforcing authorities identify employers who do not take action to comply with the relevant law and guidance to control public health risks. When they do, they can take a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. The HSE and your local authority are examples of enforcing authorities.</p>

<p>When they identify serious breaches, enforcing authorities can do a number of things. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sending you a letter.</li>
  <li>serving you with an improvement or prohibition notice.</li>
  <li>bringing a prosecution against you, in cases where they identify significant breaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an enforcing authority issues you with any advice or notices, you should respond rapidly and within their timescales. Inspectors are carrying out compliance checks nationwide to ensure that employers are taking the necessary steps.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Local authority powers - public health</strong></p>

<p>Local authorities have temporary powers to help them to protect public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This means they can place restrictions on a business if there is a serious and imminent threat to public health because of COVID-19. This could mean limiting the number of people who can attend an event, changing the way a venue operates to reduce the risk of transmission or prohibiting an event from happening.</p>

<p>These powers can only be used where they are necessary to protect public health. The measures imposed by the local authority must be a proportionate way to secure that protection. They cannot be used to place blanket restrictions on types of events or venues. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-under-coronavirus-regulations/local-authority-powers-to-impose-restrictions-health-protection-coronavirus-restrictions-england-no3-regulations-2020">guidance on local authority powers to impose restrictions</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>How to do a risk assessment</h3>

<p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" rel="external">tools to support you</a>.</p>

<p>You do not have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have fewer than 5 workers</li>
  <li>are self-employed</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may still find it useful to do so.</p>

<p>To carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, you should consider the different ways the virus can be spread (aerosols, droplets and surfaces) and put in place measures to reduce the risk of each type of transmission. An example of the factors you should consider is included in the box below.</p>

<p>Some activities can increase the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19. This happens where people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe heavily, such as singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices. You should consider the specific risks of your facility or event, and take additional care to manage situations where there is a higher risk of catching or passing on COVID-19.</p>

<p>You will need to translate this into the specific actions you need to take. These will depend on the nature of your organisation, including the size and type of business, how it is organised, operated and managed. The risk assessment should be reviewed regularly to ensure the measures put in place are appropriate for the various settings elite sport is operating in (e.g. training schedules and competition). This will help you to ensure that you have appropriate protocols (such as cleaning and hygiene protocols and medical protocols) in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<p>This applies to sport organisations and venue operators as well as to events you may organise. If you are organising events, you should also consider the risk factors identified by the Events Research Programme when undertaking risk assessments. These are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, along with options for managing and reducing these risks and a risk management template to help you plan your event.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment should also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An up-to-date plan for what you will do in the event of an outbreak in your workplace. This includes nominating a member of staff as the single point of contact who will contact local public health teams. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#cases">section on cases and outbreaks</a>.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that workers, customers and visitors who feel unwell do not come to the workplace. By law, businesses must not require a worker who is legally required to self-isolate to work anywhere other than where they are self-isolating (normally their home).</li>
  <li>Risks arising from periods of closure. If your building is unoccupied or has reduced occupancy during a period of restrictions, you should take steps to manage any risks that could arise when reopening (for example, by reviewing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/legionella-risks-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm" rel="external">HSE’s guidance on the risk of legionella</a>).</li>
  <li>The impact of your policies on groups who have protected characteristics, and to those who are more at risk of being infected with COVID-19 or have a higher risk of serious illness.</li>
  <li>Managing risk in any unusual workplaces. This could include specialist construction sites, where it can be necessary for people to work in close contact in enclosed spaces (such as roof spaces). You should consider ways to modify the work area or working practices to mitigate risk, and may find relevant advice in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/construction-and-other-outdoor-work">guidance for construction and other outdoor work</a>.</li>
  <li>The security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place. Any revisions could present new or altered security risks you may need to mitigate.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The main way of spreading COVID-19 is through close contact with an infected person. When someone with COVID-19 breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they release particles containing the virus that causes COVID-19. These particles can be breathed in by another person as aerosols or droplets.</p>

<p>You can reduce aerosol (airborne) transmission by ensuring the workplace is well-ventilated. This could mean increasing natural ventilation by letting in fresh air, increasing mechanical ventilation using fans and ducts, and using outdoor space where possible. It’s important to identify poorly ventilated spaces that are usually occupied and improve fresh air flow in these areas. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#ventilation">ventilation</a>.</p>

<p>You can reduce droplet transmission by putting in place measures which reduce contact between people who do not normally mix. This could mean placing screens or barriers between people who will come into close proximity to each other, reducing the amount of time involved in customer-facing activities, or thinking about whether you can organise your teams or arrange your workplace in a different way. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#workforce-5">reducing contact for workers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions#customers-3">managing customers, crowds and events</a>.</p>

<p>Surfaces and objects can be contaminated with COVID-19 when people who are infected cough or sneeze near them, or if they touch them.</p>

<p>You can reduce surface transmission by keeping your workplace clean (particularly surfaces that people touch regularly), providing hand sanitiser and encouraging good hygiene behaviours such as regular handwashing. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#cleaning">cleaning and hygiene</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Medical protocols</h2>

<p>Consider appointing a COVID-19 medical officer to set protocols for infection management, medical cover and equipment, and oversee testing/symptom screening requirements and return of athletes following illness.</p>

<p><strong>It is recommended that each sport, venue and competition organiser has a named COVID-19 medical officer</strong> (except where these are part of the same organisation - e.g. a sport-run facility, or competition for your sport in your own facility). This will depend on the size of your organisation and the provision you have. It could be an existing medical officer (where you have one) or the responsibility of one of the medical team. It is good practice for this to be a physician who is familiar with the emerging evidence related to post-COVID-19 pathology.</p>

<p>The medical officer should work with the COVID-19 officer (where you have one) to inform the medical aspects of the risk register and set appropriate protocols.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 medical officer should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support the COVID-19 officer with any medical aspects of the risk assessment and mitigation process. This will include setting protocols for testing and screening, infection management, medical cover and equipment.</li>
  <li>Ensure any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases are managed in line with the sport’s COVID-19 case management protocols and relevant government guidance.  You can see further advice on managing cases in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#cases">section on cases and outbreaks</a> below.</li>
  <li>Set appropriate protocols for the return of athletes and staff following self-isolation or suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19, and how they should be medically assessed. Have medical oversight of the return of athletes, including a check-up before re-engaging in any training or competition.</li>
  <li>Determine what level of monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms or testing for COVID-19 is required, and how any regular screening for COVID-19 symptoms will take place. Screening should include a questionnaire as a minimum.</li>
  <li>Oversee testing and symptom screening requirements. Regular screening for symptoms within the training environment may be carried out by an appropriately trained healthcare professional working with a set of protocols defined in the risk assessment mitigation plan and signed off by the medical officer.</li>
  <li>Ensure an appropriate level of medical staffing is in place to manage any injuries and illness, alongside additional measures such as COVID-19 symptom screening.</li>
  <li>Ensure that staff receive appropriate training. For example, those working at a sport event should familiarise themselves with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov">guidance for first responders</a>, in case of emergency situations.</li>
  <li>Consider whether personal protective equipment (PPE) is required, and ensure it is available where appropriate (and that relevant staff are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">trained in appropriate usage and disposal</a>). You can see further advice on PPE below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Personal protective equipment (PPE)</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 medical officer should consider whether personal protective equipment (PPE) is required for relevant staff, taking into account the following guidance. This should be considered through your risk assessment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where close face-to-face contact is required, the COVID-19 medical officer may decide that medical personnel and patients should wear face coverings. This is particularly important when they are conducting treatments which require them to be in close proximity to a person’s face, mouth and nose.</li>
  <li>Where there is a greater risk of exposure to the virus, they may recommend the use of PPE such as visors and  specific types of face masks to protect the practitioner’s eyes, mouth and nose (for example, for practitioners who need to work in close contact with potentially symptomatic individuals, or for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders/interim-guidance-for-first-responders-and-others-in-close-contact-with-symptomatic-people-with-potential-2019-ncov">first responders</a> in emergency situations).</li>
  <li>In most other cases, PPE would not be required, except where it is normally used in your work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks.</li>
  <li>If your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly. You should ensure that relevant staff are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">trained in their appropriate usage and disposal</a> of PPE.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Cases and outbreaks</h3>

<p>The COVID-19 medical officer should work with the COVID-19 officer to ensure they have appropriate protocols for managing cases or outbreaks of COVID-19. This should be set out in your risk register, and should include the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring that all NHS Test and Trace protocols are followed.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that any workers, visitors or athletes who have symptoms or who have tested positive leave the facility immediately to self-isolate.</li>
  <li>Where possible, the individual being assessed on-site by the COVID-19 medical officer (or another medical professional following the protocols set by the COVID-19 medical officer).</li>
  <li>Informing your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">local authority public health team</a>. Where possible, nominate a single point of contact to lead on contacting local public health teams. </li>
  <li>Ensuring your facility is thoroughly cleaned. Follow the measures set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are organising an event with spectators, reviewing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a> and ensuring you include appropriate protocols for managing cases in spectators.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Sports, clubs and support service providers</h2>

<p>It is considered good practice for sport organisations, clubs and support service providers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clearly communicate that any individual involved with an elite sport training environment and/or competition has the right to ‘opt out’ of these activities at any time, highlighting that no unreasonable steps will be taken against them as a consequence.</li>
  <li>Ensure athletes and staff are aware of any relevant guidance or safety measures in place, such as training protocols, cleaning and hygiene measures at facilities, or competition requirements. Clearly communicate any changes to protocols or requirements.</li>
  <li>Ensure that you have appropriate insurance cover, and that any support staff within the training environment are operating to the minimum standards of practice required by any professional body endorsement and professional indemnity insurances.</li>
  <li>Consider any additional risks that may affect athletes or staff who are more at risk of being infected with COVID-19 or have a higher risk of serious illness.</li>
  <li>Consider how any measures you put in place will affect staff with protected characteristics, and any adjustments you should make to take account of your duties under the equalities legislation. Discuss with disabled workers and athletes what reasonable adjustments can be made so they can work, train and participate safely in the training or competition environment. Where relevant, consider whether you should take any additional actions to support athletes who need support with complex impairments.</li>
  <li>Be aware of, and focus on, the importance of mental health during the pandemic recovery. Ensure that the mental wellbeing of athletes and staff is taken into account as well as their physical health. Review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-mental-health-and-wellbeing-aspects-of-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of COVID-19</a> and consider how best to provide support to athletes and staff.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Face coverings</h3>

<p>Sport organisations should encourage their staff/volunteers, athletes and visitors to wear face coverings where they will be in enclosed and crowded spaces (but not when taking part in sport, including training and competitions).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, people should wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed settings where they come into contact with people they do not normally meet. Where worn correctly, this can reduce the risk of transmission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Athletes and support staff may be asked to wear face coverings in training and competition venues or events, when not participating in sporting activities. You should advise them to follow the competition or facility’s guidance where possible and appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People in your organisation may choose to wear face coverings. You should support them in doing so, and ensure they are aware of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">guidance on using face coverings safely</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Venue operators/competition organisers and organisations which are employers should consider recommending the use of face coverings as a safety measure, where people will be in enclosed and crowded spaces and come into contact with others they don’t normally meet. When deciding whether you will recommend that people wear face coverings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You need to consider the reasonable adjustments needed for workers and customers with disabilities. You also need to carefully consider how this fits with other obligations to workers and customers arising from the law on employment rights, health and safety and equality legislation.</li>
      <li>You should not ask people to wear face coverings while taking part in any strenuous activity or sport.</li>
      <li>Remember that some people are not able to wear face coverings, and the reasons for this may not be visible to others. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances. Be aware that face coverings may make it harder to communicate with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are organising an event with spectators, review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20211206214344mp_/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions" rel="external">guidance for events and attractions</a> for further advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission</h3>

<p>You should take steps to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading at your organisation, and any facilities you operate in or competitions and events you hold.</p>

<h4>Facility/venue operators should consider displaying an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code poster</a> so that people can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You can choose to display an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">NHS QR code</a> so that visitors customers can check in using the NHS COVID-19 app.
    <ul>
      <li>You are not required to display an NHS QR code, to collect customer contact details, or keep a record of your staff and visitors.</li>
      <li>However, allowing customers to check in using the NHS COVID-19 app will help NHS Test and Trace to reduce the spread of the virus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to display an NHS QR code, you do not have to ask visitors to check in, or turn them away if they refuse. However, you should also have a system to collect (and securely store) names and contact details, for those who ask to check in but who do not have access to a smartphone or who prefer not to use the app. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">how to keep records for NHS Test and Trace</a>.</p>

<h4>Consider using COVID-19 status checks to reduce the risk of transmission at your venue or events you hold.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You are not required to check the COVID-19 status of your organisation’s workers and volunteers, athletes and visitors. However, if you hold events where large crowds gather, or people are likely to mix in close contact at your organisation or your facilities/venues, you may choose to ask people to demonstrate their COVID-19 status. This will reduce the risk of COVID-19 being transmitted at your venue or event.</li>
  <li>You should consider how COVID-19 status checks fit with your legal obligations, such as health and safety and equalities legislation.</li>
  <li>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance on events and attractions</a> for more information about how you can manage this at your venue event, including guidance on how to check NHS COVID Passes and managing crowds. You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event">guidance on carrying out COVID-19 status checks</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Cleaning / hygiene protocols</h3>

<p>Facility/venue operators should put in place cleaning protocols for the facility, which meet government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a> as a minimum.</p>

<p>Cleaning protocols should include provision for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Routine cleaning of all areas accessed by elite athletes, support staff and facilities staff at the beginning and end of the training day,</strong> paying particular attention to high-traffic areas and surfaces that are touched regularly, such as door handles, lift buttons and handrails.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Routine and thorough cleaning of all spectator areas where these are in use,</strong> including seating, concourse areas and toilets, including between each competition session. Particular attention should be paid to frequent touch-points such as doors, door handles, seat arms, handrails and taps. There is further guidance on management of spectators in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance on events and attractions</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Frequently cleaning of higher-risk areas, such as toilet facilities, changing rooms and showers,</strong> during the day and at the end of the day. Hosts/venue operators should set clear use and cleaning guidance to ensure these areas are kept clean, including putting up a visible and up-to-date cleaning schedule. Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks. Water fountains should be frequently cleaned, and only used to fill personal bottles (you should advise against face-to-tap drinking).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Deep-cleaning where required,</strong> such as after higher-risk activity in enclosed spaces, or where the area/equipment has been used by someone who later reports COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test. If you are cleaning after a known or suspected case of COVID-19, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance on cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Any additional cleaning needs identified through your risk register,</strong> or in consultation with venues, competition organisers or other sport organisations.
    <ul>
      <li>This could include cleaning relevant areas or shared equipment between sessions for different groups of athletes, which should be agreed in advance with the relevant groups. Where users are expected to clean gym equipment (such as fixed machines, free weights and large equipment handles), the host/venue operator should place visible notices to remind them to do so, and ensure they have the materials they will need (such as sprays and paper towels).</li>
      <li>This could also include equipment being brought into the training venue (such as specialist technical equipment or wheelchairs).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleaning of clinical areas should meet any relevant standards set by Public Health England. This should be discussed with the COVID-19 medical officer.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Put in place hygiene measures to reduce the risk of transmission. This should include providing handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser,</strong> particularly in high-traffic or higher-risk areas, such as concourse areas, doorways, lifts and bathroom facilities. This could include placing hand sanitiser stations at the entrances of different buildings or areas within your event site.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure handwashing facilities or hand sanitiser stations are available near shared facilities, equipment and objects.</strong> For example, at the entrance and exit of toilet facilities, and near food/drink kiosks.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Ensure that handwashing and hand sanitiser facilities are checked and refilled regularly,</strong> and that any equipment placed is accessible to (and does not impede) wheelchair users.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Maintain good hygiene practices, such as encouraging staff and customers to use hand sanitiser and wash their hands regularly.</strong> You could use signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing techniques, the need to increase handwashing frequency, and good hygiene practices (like avoiding touching your face, and coughing or sneezing into your arm). Consider how to ensure safety messages reach those with hearing or vision impairments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Ventilation</h3>

<p>Ventilation plays an important role in reducing the risk of aerosol (airborne) transmission of COVID-19. Use your risk assessment to think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to make sure there is an adequate supply of fresh air in your workplace. This is particularly important for indoor spaces where there are people present. <a class="govuk-link" href="#ventilation-1">Read about improving ventilation</a>.</li>
  <li>Finding out if there are areas of your workplace which don’t have enough ventilation, and how you can improve fresh air flow in these areas. <a class="govuk-link" href="#ventilation-2">Read about poorly ventilated spaces</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improving ventilation</h4>

<p>Good ventilation brings fresh air into indoor spaces. The more fresh air that is brought inside, the more it will dilute any virus particles in the air. In spaces which don’t have enough ventilation, virus particles can remain in the air after an infected person has left and increase the risk of COVID-19 spreading.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external">Watch a video from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) which explains how ventilation reduces the risk of transmission</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure there is an adequate supply of fresh air in your workplace. This can be natural ventilation (opening windows, doors and vents), mechanical ventilation (fans and ducts), or a combination of both. It’s particularly important to keep toilets and showers well-ventilated, as these can be areas of higher risk.</p>

<p><strong>How to improve natural ventilation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Open doors, windows and air vents where possible.</li>
  <li>Opening doors and windows even for a brief period can help to refresh the air and reduce COVID-19 particles.</li>
  <li>Opening the windows and doors fully will let the most fresh air into the space.</li>
  <li>Encourage people to use outside space where it’s practical, especially for higher-risk activities such as exercise, or when people are singing or raising their voices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to improve mechanical ventilation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that your systems are set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation.</li>
  <li>It’s not advised to recirculate air from one space to another. Systems which recirculate air from one space to another are likely to increase the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>Recirculation units that do not bring in fresh air can remain in operation as long as there is an alternative supply of fresh air.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Ventilation and workplace temperature</strong></p>

<p>Providing adequate ventilation does not mean people have to work in an uncomfortably cold workplace.</p>

<p>There are steps you can take to make sure your workplace is adequately ventilated without being too cold, such as partially opening windows and doors and opening higher-level windows.</p>

</div>

<h4>Identify and manage poorly ventilated spaces</h4>

<p>It’s important to find out if there are poorly ventilated areas of your workplace that are usually occupied by people (workers or customers), so you can increase the flow of fresh air.</p>

<p><strong>How to identify poorly ventilated spaces</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Look for areas where people are usually present for an extended period of time, and where there is no mechanical ventilation and no natural ventilation (such as open windows, vents or doors).</li>
  <li>Use a carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitor to measure the level of ventilation (see below for more information). In an area or room people are using, an average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of above 1500ppm indicates that it is poorly ventilated.</li>
  <li><strong>You should take action to improve ventilation where CO<sub>2</sub> readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider factors which may increase the risk</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>In a poorly ventilated space, the risk of COVID-19 transmission will increase where there are more virus particles being released into the air.</li>
  <li>When identifying poorly ventilated spaces, you should pay particular attention to areas of high occupancy (which are used by a larger number of people) and which are used for extended periods of time, as these factors will increase the risk of transmission.</li>
  <li>You should also consider how the space is used. Some activities can increase the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19. This happens where people are doing activities which generate more particles as they breathe heavily, such as singing, dancing, exercising or raising their voices.</li>
  <li><strong>Where there is continuous talking or singing, or high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercise), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels below 800ppm is recommended.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>What you should do<br><br>
</h4>

<p>If your risk assessment shows that there are poorly ventilated areas in your workplace, it’s important that you improve the ventilation to reduce the risk of COVID-19 being spread in these areas.</p>

<p>Follow the steps above to improve ventilation by opening doors, windows and vents, if possible, and by ensuring that any mechanical ventilation system is set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation.</p>

<p>If these options are not available or do not provide sufficient ventilation (for example, if CO<sub>2</sub> readings remain above recommended levels, or the room continues to feel stuffy), you can think about other ways to reduce the risk in these spaces.</p>

<p><strong>Think about changing the way these spaces are used. For example, you could:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Restrict the number of people who can use the space at the same time.</li>
  <li>Restrict the length of time people spend in the space.</li>
  <li>Move activities which involve exercising, dancing or raising voices (singing, shouting or talking loudly) to an area with better ventilation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Think about ways to increase mechanical ventilation.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask a ventilation engineer to check the performance of your mechanical ventilation system, especially if it hasn’t been serviced recently.</li>
  <li>Install a mechanical ventilation system, if you don’t have mechanical ventilation or if the existing system does not provide fresh air.</li>
  <li>Install an air cleaning or filtration unit. Air cleaning or filtration is not a substitute for good ventilation. But where poor ventilation cannot be improved in other ways, a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter or ultraviolet air purifier could help to reduce the number of COVID-19 particles in the air. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/air-cleaning-and-filtration-units.htm" rel="external">Read HSE’s advice on air cleaning and filtration devices</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors to identify poorly ventilated spaces</strong></p>

<p><strong>Using Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors</strong><br>
People exhale carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) when they breathe out. If there is a build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> in an area it can indicate that ventilation needs improving.</p>

<p>Although CO<sub>2</sub> levels are not a direct measure of possible exposure to COVID-19, checking levels using a monitor can help you identify poorly ventilated areas. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/identifying-poorly-ventilated-areas.htm" rel="external">Read HSE advice on how to use a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How the measurements can help you take action</strong><br>
CO<sub>2</sub> measurements should be used as a broad guide to ventilation rather than treating them as safe thresholds.</p>

<p>Outdoor levels are around 400ppm (parts per million of carbon dioxide). Indoors, a consistent CO<sub>2</sub> value less than 800ppm is likely to indicate that a space is well-ventilated.</p>

<p>A CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of above 1500ppm when a room is occupied is an indicator of poor ventilation. You should take action to improve ventilation where CO<sub>2</sub> readings are consistently higher than 1500ppm.</p>

<p>Where there is continuous talking or singing, or high levels of physical activity (such as dancing, playing sport or exercising), providing ventilation sufficient to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels below 800ppm is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Where CO<sub>2</sub> monitors can help</strong><br>
CO<sub>2</sub> monitors can be used to check ventilation in a wide range of settings.</p>

<p>In large areas such as concert halls or event spaces, multiple sensors may be required to provide meaningful information.</p>

<p>There are some spaces where CO<sub>2</sub> monitors are less likely to provide useful readings. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Areas occupied by people for short periods or for varying amounts of time. For example, a railway station or an atrium.</li>
  <li>Areas where air cleaning units are in use. Filtration can remove contaminants (such as COVID-19) from the air but will not remove CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
  <li>Spaces like changing rooms, toilets or small meeting rooms.</li>
  <li>Spaces used by low numbers of people.</li>
  <li>Areas where CO<sub>2</sub> is produced as part of a work process.</li>
</ul>

Where CO<sub>2</sub> monitors cannot be used, you should still identify poorly ventilated spaces and provide adequate ventilation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Competition environments</h2>

<p>Elite sport competitions are typically delivered in partnership by multiple organisations and delivery models can be complex. There may be crossover in responsibilities between the competition delivery partners and elite sport organisations. All user groups should work collectively to ensure that competitions can be staged safely.</p>

<p>If you are planning events with spectators (or hosting other events open to visitors in your facility) you should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>, which sets out further advice on managing spectators. There is advice on the types of measures you can take to reduce risk at events, and a risk management template to help you plan your event.</p>

<p><strong>The competition delivery partners should regularly consult with the Safety Advisory Group, local authority and local UKHSA representatives,</strong> to understand the prevailing risk environment and assess if the competition can be safely hosted. There is more detailed advice on working with local authorities and other partners in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">guidance for events and attractions</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to competition, competition delivery partners should ensure that the following minimum standards are in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Agreement over the roles and responsibilities and command, control and coordination arrangements between the competition delivery partners and the elite sport organisation(s).</li>
  <li>A decision-making structure and agreed procedure in place to modify, restrict, postpone or cancel the competition, should this be required or indicated by government guidance or public health data/developments.</li>
  <li>Any measures required to comply with government/PHE guidelines (relating to sport-specific rules, technical requirements or equipment) are agreed and put in place by the national/international governing body for that sport.</li>
  <li>Where the competition organiser and venue operator are not the same person, those two parties should enter into a venue-use agreement to ensure that all relevant matters (including those set out in this guidance) are appropriately addressed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Cross-border competition</h2>

<p>Elite sport competitions are typically delivered in partnership by multiple organisations and delivery models can be complex. There may be crossover in responsibilities between the competition delivery partners and elite sport organisations. Complexity is increased in cross-border competition, when international elite sport organisations, international federations and other international user groups are introduced to the competition environment.</p>

<p>All user groups should work collectively to ensure that the competition can be staged safely. The roles, responsibilities, and command/control/coordination arrangements between the competition delivery partners and the elite sport organisation(s) should be agreed at the outset, including consideration of the role of the international federation(s), where appropriate, and any requirements of international elite sport organisations or individuals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Hosting cross-border elite sports events in England</h3>

<p>In addition to the considerations for elite sport competition (set out above, and in the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/events-and-attractions">events and attractions</a>), competition delivery partners and elite sport organisations should make early contact with the international elite sport organisations/individuals, international federations (where appropriate) and other international user groups to discuss:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The current COVID-19 situation in the UK (including risk levels and government policy), and how this may impact entry to the UK/England, planned accommodation, training, transportation, and match fixtures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether spectators/visitors will be required to provide evidence of their COVID-19 status as a condition of entering the event. See further information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/carrying-out-mandatory-covid-19-status-checks-at-your-venue-or-event">requirements for entry to indoor and outdoor events</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 plans and policies of national governing bodies (or their equivalents) of visiting international sportspersons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current COVID-19 regulations and guidance, and any implications they may have on international attendees’ medical requirements, or cultural, language, religious or vulnerability considerations which should be taken into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirement for international attendees to have in place appropriate medical insurance and/or funding to cover their medical needs outside the NHS. This should include routine medical and performance-related healthcare such as musculoskeletal injuries, including outpatient investigation. Insurance must include COVID-19 care if reciprocal home country arrangements do not apply. This should include the whole delegation for the duration of their stay in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel arrangements to the UK, including: <br><br> - The country of embarkation of international user groups and any requirements (such as visas, screening or isolation) to enter the UK. <br><br> - All countries that the individual(s) have been in within the 10 days preceding entry, and any relevant measures that will need to be taken (such as testing). <br><br> - Travel and transit through international airports and specific COVID-19 risks associated with this. <br><br> - Procedures for arrivals/departures, and ground transport.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any equipment (sporting or non-sporting) that will be required to deliver the competition and will be imported from outside the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirement to adhere to a code of behaviour, and any sanctions in place for breaches of protocols, guidance and laws.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Planning for international travel to elite sport outside the UK</h3>

<p>Key points to consider for domestic elite sports organisations, sportspersons and essential operational or support staff travelling to competition or training outside the UK.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p><strong>Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">international travel guidance</a>.</strong> Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) travel advice</a> for countries you plan to travel to, which sets out guidance on COVID-19 and other factors you should be aware of if you travel abroad. Review FCDO advice regularly prior to travel to ensure that any changes to measures can be incorporated into your plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure you are aware of relevant laws and guidance for the country you travel to.</strong> Individuals and organisations must comply with the entry requirements of countries they travel to, including any quarantine or testing laws or guidance. The COVID-19 Officer and COVID-19 Medical Officer responsible for the elite sport organisation or individual(s) should liaise with the organisers of the competition in the early stages of planning, to ensure they are aware of any relevant exemptions or conditions for participating athletes, support staff or others travelling for the competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure those travelling are aware of relevant laws and guidance.</strong> The travelling athletes and support staff will be expected to abide by the laws and guidelines of the host country (and any country through which they may travel) and organisation for the duration of their stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Put in place protocols for managing cases of COVID-19 in the travelling party.</strong> The competition should have measures in place to follow in competition settings. If applicable, work with your COVID-19 Medical Officer to establish steps to take if athletes or staff develop symptoms and/or test positive in other settings (e.g. during travel). This should involve the relevant individual(s) isolating, appropriate contact tracing procedures being followed, and planning for their return to the UK when it is safe to do so (in line with travel and public health rules and guidelines in the UK and in the country in which they are competing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for your return to the UK.</strong> Take into account the relevant laws and guidance for entering the UK, such as testing measures that may apply, for example for travellers who are not fully vaccinated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider post-travel arrangements for returning to sport and work.</strong> When athletes and staff are back in the UK, they should return to following their sport’s protocols.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>International travel to England</h2>

<p>This section relates to the rules for entering England from overseas. If you are travelling to another part of the UK, you should check the relevant guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/pages/red-amber-and-green-list-countries/" rel="external">Scotland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/rules-foreign-travel-and-wales-coronavirus-covid-19-html" rel="external">Wales</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>People arriving in England from abroad must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk">complete a passenger locator form</a> in the 48 hours before they arrive in England and follow different rules depending on whether they qualify as fully vaccinated under the rules for travel to England. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">international travel guidance</a> for more information on who qualifies as fully vaccinated, and what you need to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>People who are fully vaccinated under an approved programme</strong> are not required to take a COVID-19 test before or after they travel to England, or to quarantine when they arrive (though should consider self-isolating if they have a positive result on a COVID-19 test).
    <ul>
      <li>The rules for fully vaccinated people also apply to children under 18, people taking part in approved vaccine trials and people who are exempt from vaccination on medical grounds. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19#travelling-with-children">Read more about exemptions and how the rules apply to children</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>People who are not fully vaccinated under an approved programme</strong> need to:
    <ul>
      <li>take a COVID-19 test in the 2 days before they travel to England</li>
      <li>before travelling to England, book and pay for a COVID-19 <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> test – to be taken after they arrive (on day 0) in England on or before day 2</li>
      <li>self-isolate if the COVID-19 <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> arrival test result is positive or unclear</li>
      <li>enter their <abbr title="Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test]">PCR</abbr> arrival test booking reference number in the passenger locator form</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are different rules for countries and territories on the red list. Entry to the UK from red-list areas is restricted to British and Irish Nationals, or those with residence rights in the UK. People who meet this requirement and have been in a red-list country or territory in the 10 days before they arrive in England must book and stay in a managed quarantine hotel, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories">rules for countries and territories on the red list</a> for more information.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The requirements for people arriving in England do not apply to the ‘common travel area’, which includes the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. People who have only travelled from or through countries in the common travel area in the 10 days before they arrive in England are not required by the Regulations to complete a passenger locator form, take any COVID-19 tests, or quarantine when they arrive.</p>
