<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Defining climate-related investment beliefs</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>investment beliefs can help focus trustees’ investment decision-making and make it more effective. Climate change should be considered as part of these beliefs</li>
  <li>trustees should allow appropriate time and ongoing training to ensure that they have a sufficient understanding of climate change to define their investment beliefs</li>
  <li>trustees should consider the roles and responsibilities within the trustee board (and, where applicable, any sub-committees and/or individuals/organisations providing executive support to the trustees) for climate-related issues</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1. </span> Investment beliefs</h3>

<p>1. Trustee boards may find it helpful to develop and maintain a set of beliefs about how investment markets function and which factors lead to good investment outcomes.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> Investment beliefs, developed by reference to research and experience, can help focus trustees’ investment decision-making and make it more effective. Viewed as a statement of intent, investment beliefs should be reviewed regularly in order to maintain relevance. Climate change should be considered as part of these beliefs and, when documented, be integrated within them. Trustees’ investment beliefs should not be confused with their personal (i.e. ethical or moral) beliefs.</p>

<p>2. Trustees should define their climate-related investment beliefs (for example, about potential future climate change scenarios, how to manage their impacts, both through the integration into the investment process and through acting as effective stewards, and take climate-related opportunities). Beliefs should take into account practical circumstances (for example, scheme size/resources, internally/externally managed assets and preference for an active/passive investment approach).</p>

<p>3. Trustees may wish to consider including the following in their investment beliefs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trustees should consider how their overarching strategic aims and investment objectives will influence incorporation of climate change into their frameworks</li>
  <li>trustees should consider the balance between engagement, voting and/or divestment as appropriate tools to manage climate-related risks</li>
  <li>trustees should understand what their collective investment beliefs mean for the portfolio and how they will shape member engagement</li>
  <li>trustees should ensure that their beliefs are actionable and they should consider any potential consequences that they could result in, as well as impacts to the investment budget</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Trustees should consider the internal consistency of their investment beliefs. For example, trustees of defined contribution schemes who believe in the efficacy for the scheme’s default fund of a pure passive market-cap weighted fund with no flexibility to reduce allocations selectively should consider how this will reconcile with strong beliefs in relation to the impact of climate change on markets during the time horizon of the scheme’s members. Likewise, trustees who believe in the ability of asset managers to identify and exploit asset mispricing should consider how this reconciles with a view that climate-related risks alone have been adequately “priced in” to company valuations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2. </span> Trustee climate competence: knowledge and understanding required to define investment beliefs</h3>

<p>5. Where trustees identify a lack of sufficient understanding of climate-related financial risks to define their investment beliefs on the issue with confidence (or that there has previously been insufficient time allocated on board agendas to it), they should allocate specific time at a future board meeting or an investment strategy session dedicated to climate-related risk issues.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Trustees should ensure that they allow adequate time to look at the issue in sufficient depth to ensure that they are meeting their legal duties. This might include more detailed sessions on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the latest evidence on the investment impacts of climate change and views from investment consultants, asset managers, independent experts and other advisers on how climate-related risks and opportunities have the potential to affect different investment portfolios</li>
  <li>the trustees’ legal obligations to consider and act on climate-related issues (and the extent to which the trustees’ policies need to be disclosed or reported on)</li>
  <li>in a defined benefit scheme, the potential impact of climate-related risks on the scheme sponsor’s covenant</li>
  <li>the range of possible actions that might be taken to help manage climate-related risks (and capture the opportunities), including case studies of good practice actions across the investment community. Trustees may also wish to consider the potential impacts if there is an active decision to ‘do nothing’</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Setting scheme investment strategy and manager selection, review and monitoring</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>trustees should consider how different investments and investment strategies could be affected by the transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient economy and under different future climate scenarios</li>
  <li>scenario analysis and modelling are helpful tools to use in considering climate risks in setting the scheme’s investment strategy</li>
  <li>trustees should consider their risk appetite and time horizons in the context of their scheme and their current investment strategy, noting the need for well-defined risk management processes to ensure climate related-risks are effectively measured and managed</li>
  <li>trustees should consider how climate risks may affect different asset classes and sectors in which the scheme has invested and the investment approaches in each portfolio</li>
  <li>having determined their overall strategic asset allocation, trustees should consider the mandates set for each asset class and the method by which investments are made; and they should identify strategic actions to reduce exposure to climate-related risks, as well as options for investment in climate-related opportunities</li>
  <li>climate competence should be factored into both manager selection, review and monitoring to execute agreed mandates for each asset class and method of investment</li>
  <li>trustees must be able to assess the potential size and scope of risks, which pose the most significant potential loss and which are the most likely to occur. This process of assessing risk can be multi-tiered, taking place at various levels of risk at the scheme, portfolio or asset-level</li>
  <li>trustees should make use of the expertise of their investment consultants and advisers but should not be overly reliant on them to set the agenda. Trustees should challenge advisers and set objectives for them to factor climate-related risks into their advice. Climate competence should be considered when reviewing advisers</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span> Investment (and investment adviser) objectives</h3>

<p>6. Trustees should set clear investment objectives for their scheme (and their advisers) and identify how and when they should be achieved. A scheme’s investment strategy (and any adviser objectives to support that strategy) should support and be consistent with the trustees’ objectives, taking account of the trustees’ view of climate-related risks in the circumstances of the scheme and allowing for the fact that the objectives may evolve over time.</p>

<p>7. Trustees should distinguish between strategies for defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. In a defined benefit scheme, this will involve considering the scheme’s funding levels and employer covenant as part of an integrated risk management (<abbr title="integrated risk management">IRM</abbr>) approach.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> In a defined contribution scheme, trustees should consider the risk/return profile appropriate to the membership and in particular the design of the default investment strategy. This will involve consideration of the needs of the scheme’s members, and how these might change in the future.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2. </span> Considering risk appetite</h3>

<p>8. Considering risk appetite can help trustees determine whether their current investment strategy is appropriate. Trustees should consider how different investments and investment strategies could be affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy and/or the physical impacts of climate change under different scenarios and whether implementing an alternative strategy may be more likely to achieve the scheme’s objectives. Trustees should also consider their risk appetite for capitalising on investment opportunities connected with the transition to a low-carbon economy and, if applicable, their belief that they should help to fund investments that are needed to achieve the low carbon transition.</p>

<p>9. Adequate risk management depends on having the right processes and the right metrics in place. However, it is worth reiterating that climate change represents a negative externality that carries potentially very high and costly market-wide risks which may be largely unpriced or mispriced. The scale and complexity of climate change and its resulting impacts requires strong and well-defined risk management processes to ensure that the risks are being measured and managed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3. </span> Considering time horizons</h3>

<p>10. Trustees need to understand how climate-related issues may affect the scheme’s investment strategy and, where relevant, funding strategy over the short, medium and long term. They should set out what they consider to be the relevant short, medium and long term time horizons for their scheme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>trustees should describe the relevant short and medium term time horizons; longest horizons</li>
  <li>in <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes, the longest time horizon to be considered will be the time over which the benefits will be paid to their members from the scheme</li>
  <li>in <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> schemes, the longest time horizon to be considered will be the time over which members’ money will be invested via the scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>11. It is up to trustees how they determine their time horizons, but trustees could approach this by thinking about their shorter horizons relative to their longest horizon. For example, If the longest time horizon is less than 10 years, trustees may decide to only have a short and a long time horizon. Trustees should consider the time horizons which would be most suitable based on the range of climate-related risks and opportunities that the scheme may face.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4. </span> Use of scenario analysis</h3>

<p>12. Trustees should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>undertake climate scenario analysis and/or modelling, considering the scenarios to be used, how the impacts are calculated and the output of the analysis (by asset class, sector, strategic asset allocation etc.)</li>
  <li>consider how they use scenario analysis (including the impact of different scenarios on different types of assets, sectors and investment approaches within each portfolio) to manage climate related risks and opportunities, including how the analysis has been interpreted and acted on and any future plans</li>
</ul>

<p>13. See Part III of this guidance for further details on scenario analysis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5. </span> Considering climate-related risks as part of strategic asset allocation</h3>

<p>14. Trustees should consider how climate-related risks may affect the different asset classes the pension scheme is invested in over time.</p>

<p>15. The proportion of different types of growth, matching and other assets held will vary by scheme (depending in a defined benefit scheme on the maturity of the scheme, its funding levels and employer covenant). In a defined contribution scheme a default fund may have a pre-determined process by which assets are transitioned from higher growth to lower volatility as a member approaches retirement age.</p>

<p>16. Growth assets are generally expected to be more sensitive to climate-related risks than matching assets<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> but trustees should consider the impact of different climate change scenarios on all asset classes (see Part III of this guidance). This should be factored into investment decision-making as part of a scheme’s strategic asset allocation – i.e. a top-down integration instead of employing a case-by-case bottom-up approach to climate change.</p>

<p>17. The consideration of climate-related risks, using scenario analysis, may prompt trustees to make changes in their overall strategic allocations to different asset classes or the timeframe over which an agreed transition from growth to matching assets will occur. Trustees may also wish to consider whether certain asset classes and sectors may be expected to benefit from the low carbon transition and may wish to make positive allocations to these and/or make changes to the scheme’s strategic allocation targets (for example, set targets to increase exposure to certain types of infrastructure, real estate, private equity, etc. within a set timeframe).</p>

<p>18. Trustees may also wish to consider how agreed asset allocation targets and ranges may be impacted by climate change and whether it is necessary to increase ranges around existing asset class allocations to provide more leeway for significant moves towards the upper and lower boundaries during times of high volatility.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6. </span> Determining how climate-related risks are incorporated within investment mandates and portfolio construction</h3>

<p>19. Having determined their overall strategic asset allocation, trustees must consider the mandates they intend to set for each asset class and the method by which the investments will be made.</p>

<p>20. Because trustees generally do not choose specific investments themselves,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> they will usually delegate this power to authorised asset managers.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> Whilst some larger pension schemes may invest through a manager who will manage a segregated portfolio of assets on behalf of the trustees, in many cases trustees will invest via pooled funds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>actively managed pooled funds – In relation to the selection of an actively managed pooled fund (or the appointment of an active manager in relation to a segregated mandate), trustees should carefully consider the investment objectives and restrictions under which the manager will make investment decisions. Trustees should identify funds and managers which adopt an investment approach which is aligned with the trustees’ investment beliefs (including engagement and, where applicable, voting policies – see chapter 3). Manager capabilities should be considered carefully (see [2.7] below)</li>
  <li>passively managed pooled funds - In relation to passively managed funds, trustees should consider the indices that might be suitable to track. To date, market-capitalisation weighted indices have been used by the majority of pension trustees (particularly in defined contribution schemes). However, these indices usually reflect business-as-usual scenarios and as allocation guidelines for sector diversification, such indices may tend to overweight high carbon sectors (for example, oil and gas). Trustees may wish to consider the use of alternative indices if they wish to maintain a passive approach. However, in doing so care should be taken as <abbr title="environmental, social and governance">ESG</abbr> or climate tilted indices may suffer from the same flaw by maintaining overall sector allocations (going overweight for some oil and gas firms to compensate for being underweight in another)</li>
</ul>

<p>21. Where applicable, trustees may consider a number of strategic actions to reduce identified exposure to risks and/or take advantage of opportunities. These might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making positive allocations to certain assets and sectors that may benefit from the low-carbon transition</li>
  <li>reducing exposure to certain assets and sectors that may be harmed by the low-carbon transition</li>
  <li>making changes to the scheme’s strategic allocation targets (for example, set targets to increase exposure to certain types of infrastructure, real estate etc. within a set timeframe)</li>
  <li>changing the timeframe over which an agreed transition from growth to matching assets will occur (<abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes)</li>
  <li>a shift in passive investments to low carbon benchmarks rather than tracking a market-capitalisation weighted index (which have tended to reflect ‘business as usual’ scenarios)</li>
  <li>making use of funds which take other “factor-based” approaches reflecting climate-related risks rather than tracking an index</li>
  <li>changes to the investment objectives and restrictions under which a manager will make investment decisions in actively managed pooled funds or a segregated mandate</li>
  <li>engagement with asset managers and investee companies on climate-related risks (more about this in chapter 2.7-2.8), collaborating with trustees of other schemes as appropriate and other managers, investors or campaign groups</li>
  <li>replacing existing asset managers to ones better aligned with trustees’ concerns and ambitions on climate change</li>
  <li>collaborating with other investors as appropriate on climate-related risks for example, through shareholder coalitions, shareholder resolutions etc.</li>
  <li>accelerating funding plans for example, if trustees are less confident about longer-term covenant support in light of climate risks</li>
  <li>amending the assumed future investment returns due to a revised assessment in light of climate impacts</li>
  <li>putting in place contingent funding arrangements to offer protection against adverse transition developments for covenant</li>
  <li>reviewing the design of the scheme’s <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> Default funds; and</li>
  <li>revising the range of self-select funds for <abbr title="defined contribution">DC</abbr> schemes and communicating to members on this</li>
</ul>

<p>22. Trustees should establish their preferred approach(es) and consider and document any changes to the trustees’ strategy over time. These should be embedded into the trustees’ governance, investment strategy, risk management and reporting processes.</p>

<p>23. Trustees may also wish to consider the potential strategic options for investing in climate-related opportunities and agree priority areas for further research (including the extent to which the trustees expect their investment consultants or asset managers to investigate and present opportunities in these areas).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7. </span> Factoring climate-related risk management capabilities into the selection, review and monitoring of asset managers</h3>

<p>24. Having decided upon the mandates they intend to set for each asset class, as well as the method of investment, trustees must consider the process and requirements for the selection, review and monitoring of managers to execute these mandates. This may begin with a review of the climate policies of existing or prospective managers. However, it also requires rigorous due diligence on how these are executed. An assessment of an asset manager’s governance of climate issues and the broader integration of climate impacts into their business strategy is recommended. Appendix 2 provides a number of suggestions for trustees to help them carry out due diligence of asset managers’ capabilities and approach to climate-related risk management.</p>

<p>25. Climate competence should therefore be factored into the choice of managers. Challenging asset managers over their current practices will prevent greenwashing; engaging with them will promote better understanding of climate related issues. The fund manager should be capable of explaining underlying carbon-risk exposures, as well as demonstrating that environmental considerations have been considered during portfolio construction and engagement activities.</p>

<p>26. Where schemes invest through a segregated portfolio, whether active or passive, trustees should seek to ensure that their existing managers take an approach to climate which largely aligns with the trustee’s investment beliefs. Where trustees carry out a tender exercise for the appointment of a new manager trustees may wish to consider in addition the prospective managers’ broader investment offering and approach and potentially the expertise, capability and track record of the manager to work with the trustees to develop and deliver solutions aligned with their investment beliefs around climate change.</p>

<p>27. For those schemes investing via pooled funds, whether active or passive, trustees should assess the integration capabilities of managers and approach taken for that fund/strategy; these should cover a range of approaches.</p>

<p>28. For active (and factor-based) strategies, it is important to consider how the asset manager applies climate research, data and beliefs to enhance their fundamental analysis (or factor-based approach), and how this is reflected in and complemented by stewardship activities and voting policies (see chapter 3). Trustees should consider the extent to which the approach aligns with their investment beliefs on climate-related issues and delivers on the pension scheme’s strategy. Trustees should assess manager performance against any climate-related mandates, performance benchmarks, or targets set by trustees and consider asking managers for examples of recent cases where climate factors have influenced buy/hold/sell investment decisions.</p>

<p>29. For passive strategies, trustees will need to have considered the suitability of market-cap based solutions, against alternative index offerings. When selecting an asset manager to provide these, trustees should in all cases rigorously assess the stewardship activities and voting policies of asset managers. When selecting climate indices, they should seek to ensure that the manager’s approach to climate more broadly, and in particularly its stewardship activities, complement the index solutions on offer.</p>

<p>30. In their monitoring and review of existing managers, trustees may also consider the following strategic actions to hold managers to account on their management of climate-related issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess quality of climate-related disclosure provided by managers, preferably against the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations</li>
  <li>assess quality of climate-related voting and engagement practices by managers (see chapter 3)</li>
  <li>require managers to perform and report back on climate scenario analysis on their holdings (see Part III)</li>
  <li>require managers to undergo periodic climate-related assessments (such as carbon auditing or stranded assets)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8. </span> Investment consultants (and fiduciary management)</h3>

<p>31. In practice, many trustees will rely heavily on their advisers and consultants to provide strategic advice about investment strategies, asset allocation and asset manager selection. Increasingly, trustees will rely on other consultant and adviser services, including manager research and analysis and reporting on asset manager performance. Although trustees will usually have ultimate responsibility for making decisions on these issues, investment consultants’ advice will often be highly influential.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>32. Where trustees have legal duties to consider and address climate risk, consultants will need to have regard to these when providing their advice. However, trustees retain ultimate responsibility to effectively monitor and oversee their advisers.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> Trustees are also required to set objectives for their investment consultants.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>33. Trustees should consider setting specific objectives for their investment consultants to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advise so as to help trustees develop climate-related strategies (and processes to manage risk) that are aligned with trustees’ investment beliefs on climate-related issues</li>
  <li>address climate-related risks and opportunities material to the scheme in their investment advice, adapting their core services accordingly (including demonstrating a robust track-record that shows the adviser’s capacity to assess and address the issues); and</li>
  <li>assess the climate-related performance (and resilience to climate related risks) of the schemes’ asset managers and funds and to proactively suggest alternative approaches where these are not aligned with the trustees’ investment beliefs on climate-related issues</li>
</ul>

<p>34. Where trustees delegate both the consultancy and implementation of investment strategy to a fiduciary manager, trustees should apply the principles relating to both asset managers and consultants as set out above. Trustees should agree with the fiduciary manager where responsibility lies in relation to each of the actions set out below, depending on the extent to which investment strategy decisions are delegated by the trustees to the fiduciary manager.</p>

<p>35. The Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group (<abbr title="Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group">ICSWG</abbr>) have a produced a helpful “Guide for assessing climate competency of Investment Consultants” which can be found in Annex 2.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The trustees’ approach to stewardship on climate issues</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>stewardship sits alongside the integration of long-term factors into investment decision-making, governance and processes</li>
  <li>it is therefore important that trustees consider how they fulfil their stewardship role (including both engagement and voting) on climate change issues to create “long-term value for…beneficiaries” and disclose their activities in this respect</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1. </span> Why stewardship forms a key part of an integrated approach to climate-risk</h3>

<p>36. The UK Stewardship Code<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> defines stewardship as “the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.”</p>

<p>37. There is a growing body of evidence<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> which demonstrates the benefits of active ownership, or good stewardship, to corporate performance. Engagement activity with investee companies (including through appointed managers) can help to encourage better practices and corporate behaviours related to climate-related risks as well as improving disclosures by those companies to enable better assessment of climate-related risks by asset owners. It should therefore form a key part of the integration of climate issues into trustee investment processes.</p>

<p>38. Although there is only one specific <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommended disclosure on stewardship or engagement, it is difficult for trustees to have a meaningful and effective governance and decision-making framework – for instance regarding investment beliefs, or use of metrics, or in disclosing their approach on climate change – without consideration of how they fulfil their stewardship role. Good Stewardship can also be an effective form of post-investment risk management.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2. </span> Principles for effective climate stewardship</h3>

<p>39. What good stewardship looks like will vary for each trustee board, depending on the scheme’s resources and the trustees’ investment beliefs. However, in all cases trustees should be clear on how stewardship fits within the scheme’s investment strategy and how it helps meet the trustees’ climate-related investment objectives.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Manager delegated approach<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup>
</h4>

<p>40. In many cases, trustees will delegate stewardship activities to the scheme’s asset managers. Where this is the case, trustees should:</p>

<p>41. Familiarise themselves with their asset manager’s stewardship policies in relation to climate-related issues (seeking to influence them where appropriate). This should include talking to their advisers and asset managers about how climate-related risks and opportunities are currently built into their engagement and voting policies and, where applicable, how they sit alongside measures taken to reflect climate-related risks within investment portfolios. Trustees should have a clear understanding of what ‘success’ by their asset managers on climate issues looks like.</p>

<p>42. Ensure that asset managers’ climate approaches are in line with the trustees’ climate-related investment beliefs and support the scheme’s investment strategy and objectives in relation to climate issues.</p>

<p>43. Hold their asset managers to account in relation to their engagement activities and voting record on climate issues. Agreeing a schedule for monitoring and reviewing outsourced stewardship activities would be good practice and will assist trustees comply with their own requirements to produce an annual statement in the scheme’s report and accounts setting out how the trustees’ voting and engagement policies have been implemented during each scheme year (see 3.2(C) above).</p>

<p>44. When appointing new asset managers, using due diligence and the asset manager appointment process to gain a clear understanding of how the prospective manager considers and integrates climate factors in their engagement and voting behaviour (including, the asset manager’s approach to securities lending).</p>

<p>45. Where asset managers outsource activities on climate stewardship, explicitly setting out expectations for such outsourced activities on climate stewardship and approaches in legal documents. This could include in documents such as the Investment Management Agreement (<abbr title="Investment Management Agreement">IMA</abbr>) or side letters to pooled fund documentation.</p>

<p>46. Encourage your asset managers to be active participants in climate-related initiatives. For example, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (<abbr title="Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change">IIGCC</abbr>), Transition Pathway Initiative (<abbr title="Transition Pathway Initiative">TPI</abbr>) and Climate Action 100+.</p>

<h4>Scheme’s own strategy</h4>

<p>47. Some trustees may have strategies to carry out their own engagement and/or voting. In this case, trustees should articulate a clear process and policy for voting on climate issues. This should identify what issues will be taken into account when deciding how to cast their vote and also set out their approach to exercising voting rights, having a clear understanding of what ‘success’ on climate issues looks like. Key issues to consider could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to make systematic use of all voting powers at trustees’ disposal to support the highest standards of climate governance and approach at investee companies</li>
  <li>under what circumstances the trustees will seek to support climate-related resolutions. Key issues for consideration would include: whether the resolution conflicts with other climate resolutions; whether it is supported by management; whether the resolution is binding or non-binding; whether the solution sought is appropriate and consistent with the business’ long-term success</li>
  <li>where scheme investments are held in pooled arrangements, the extent to which the scheme’s asset manager policies enable the casting of client votes</li>
  <li>developing an engagement strategy beyond listed equity to include assets such as fixed income, real estate, bonds and infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>48. In addition to the above, trustees might also like to consider the following as part of their overall stewardship approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>joining collective or collaborative engagement efforts. The 2012 Kay Review noted that greater collective engagement could address concerns about fragmented and disparate ownership of companies. Collaborative engagement may be particularly appropriate for those trustees with fewer resources for specific engagement activities and who can maximise their influence by joining their voice with those of others. Trustees of these schemes can work within membership bodies such as the <abbr title="Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association">PLSA</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association">UKSIF</abbr> to press for stronger co-ordinated actions. Schemes can also collaborate and join with industry groups promoting Paris alignment, including the <abbr title="Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change">IIGCC</abbr>’s Paris Aligned Investment Initiative, the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance and Transition Pathways Initiative</li>
  <li>influencing the public policy debate on climate. Investor stewardship takes place within a policy and regulatory framework which is shaped by various forces including governments, political parties, membership associations, campaign groups and public opinion. If trustees feel that the legislative framework does not sufficiently support them in acting as good stewards of their assets, they should seek to influence policy and regulatory initiatives</li>
  <li>aiming to follow and engage with the UK Stewardship Code, including becoming a signatory where possible</li>
  <li>agreeing a policy and approach for communication of stewardship activities and outcomes to stakeholders. As well as reporting duties under statutory requirements around engagement (see [3.2] above), stewardship should also be communicated with beneficiaries. Trustees could consider a standalone stewardship or responsible investment report, additional information on members’ annual benefit statements or, for defined contribution schemes, content in the Chair’s Statement</li>
</ul>

Amendments to the Investment regulations<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup> taking effect in October 2019 required all schemes to have a stewardship policy. Trustees should therefore already have considered their approach in some detail.</p>

<p>50. Whilst larger schemes are better placed to undertake direct engagement individually or through collaboration with other large investors, smaller schemes should still be able to demonstrate that they have engaged effectively with an asset manager both at appointment and through ongoing monitoring to implement this on their behalf. They should also ensure that their consultants give weight to asset managers’ track records in climate change stewardship – and stewardship more broadly - in shortlisting and recommendations.</p>

<p>51. Trustees of such schemes should refer to Appendix 1 at the end of this section which provides a list of questions aimed at obtaining detailed information from asset managers, which will help them identify a manager to deliver their stewardship policy effectively.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3. </span> Holding investee companies to account on <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>
</h3>

<p>52. The <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations apply not just to asset owners, but to intermediaries such as asset managers, and the investee companies themselves<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>. Trustees should be working with their advisers and managers to ensure a joined-up approach on <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> which extends through to these companies. This should include engagement and, where necessary, applying a voting sanction to company boards which are not effectively monitoring, assessing and providing oversight of the company’s approach to managing the risks and opportunities from climate change.</p>

<p>53. Some of the largest companies are already reporting using <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>. This can either be done in a separate Sustainability Report or integrated throughout the Annual Report – which is the approach many investors prefer. Although trustees should make allowances for smaller firms in their use of specific third-party frameworks like <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>, there should be evidence that all companies are at least broadly considering their approach to climate risk in terms of governance, strategy and risk management – and which are also making use of appropriate metrics and scenario analysis.</p>

<p>54. Trustees should look for the following as signs of good corporate behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a discussion of climate change in terms of strategic, financial and operational factors. The potential impact of different scenarios – including reactions from policymakers and regulators – on value creation in the long-term should be clearly discussed. There should also be a clear link to risk management at the executive level and risk oversight at the board level. The impact of climate risk and opportunities on the firm’s strategy over the short-, medium- and long-term should be clearly outlined</li>
  <li>clear climate-related governance and oversight structures and processes. This includes climate change expertise at board level, identification of which Director is accountable for climate issues and management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Every Director should demonstrate an understanding and awareness of the potential range of impacts which climate change may have on the company<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>a proactive approach both to identifying and managing climate risks (and opportunities) and providing sufficient disclosures on climate change. Although at this stage this does not need to include reporting using the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> framework, there should already be evidence that companies are considering the issue of climate change across the high-level <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> areas of governance, risk management, strategy, metrics and targets, and scenario analysis</li>
  <li>active consideration and discussion in reporting of both the expected physical impacts of climate change and transition impacts. In terms of physical impacts of climate change, the resilience of assets and supply chains in the face of, for example, changing weather patterns and rising sea levels should be considered as relevant. Companies also need to demonstrate consideration of the potential impact of changes in public policy and regulation around the transition to a low carbon economy</li>
  <li>clear reference in the Annual Report and Accounts to, and use of, credible industry climate reporting metrics. This should include reference to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) <abbr title="Climate Disclosure Standards Board">CDSB</abbr> (Climate Disclosures Standards Board), or other established third party frameworks. Companies should provide explanations as to the rationale for their choice of framework and the extent to which, if at all, relevant metrics have been “blended” with others. Please note: smaller and medium sized companies should be allowed some discretion and flexibility regarding their choice of framework and timescales.</li>
  <li>references in disclosures mention the Paris Agreement and mention Net Zero. Companies should disclose whether or not they have assessed whether their business model is compatible with global commitments to mitigate temperature increases and, where they do not feel this is currently the case, have outlined a process – complete with relevant timescales – under which they hope to achieve compatibility
This should include a discussion of the metrics which the company has chosen to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management. These metrics could include Scope 1, 2 or (where relevant) Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions</li>
  <li>financial disclosures include transparency on the underlying assumptions used to calculate balance sheet valuations and earnings.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> Many key valuation and profit measures disclosed by companies depend on assumptions about future returns. Investors may wish to challenge the calculations and/or substitute alternative assumptions in their own financial analysis should there be concern that these may rely on the Paris Agreement not being delivered in practice. In order to be open to such discussion, companies should be transparent on the assumptions underlying their calculations</li>
  <li>a company’s political donations and membership of trade associations are aligned with their stance on climate change. Investors have become increasingly concerned about corporate support for organisations and individuals whose lobbying activities and objectives are considered to frustrate climate change mitigation. Such support may take the form of political donations, trade association membership, or the establishment of charitable or educational trusts that undertake lobbying against progressive climate legislation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>55. Asset owners should describe, where appropriate, engagement activity with investee companies (including through appointed managers) to encourage better disclosure and practices related to climate-related risks to improve data availability and asset owners’ ability to assess climate-related risks.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Additional points for defined benefit schemes</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key Considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>trustees need to take an integrated risk management (IRM) approach to DB scheme funding and investment, looking at how climate-related risks around the employer covenant, funding, and investment strategy may be linked and inter-dependent</li>
  <li>scenario testing can help trustees and their covenant advisers assess risks to investments, funding and covenant arising from climate change</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1. </span> Assessing the impact of climate-related risks on sponsor covenant</h3>

<p>56. For <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes, the sponsor covenant is the extent of the employer’s legal obligation and financial ability to support the scheme now and in the future. TPR has previously set out in guidance its view of how the sponsor covenant should be assessed.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>57. As with any other risk, trustees need to consider risks from climate change on the sponsoring employer when assessing the strength of the current covenant.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup> Trustees should take independent external advice where they lack the objectivity or expertise required to perform an appropriate assessment.</p>

<p>58. All sponsoring employers will be exposed to climate-related risks and opportunities to some extent, although their nature and magnitude will vary considerably. Trustees of schemes with direct exposure to fossil fuels companies should be aware that their scheme will likely have above-average exposure to climate-related risks through the scheme’s sponsor covenant. However, climate-related risks may be more difficult to identify where they are longer-term in nature or primarily arise through indirect routes such as supply chain exposure.</p>

<p>59. There are various routes through which climate-related risks can affect businesses, with both direct and indirect effects on their financial strength. For example:<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>cost and availability of inputs – due to interaction of supply and demand, possibly affected (positively or negatively) by government intervention</li>
  <li>valuation of company assets – for example, fossil fuel reserves (stranded assets), high carbon infrastructure, buildings on flood plains</li>
  <li>legislative and regulatory change – mechanisms may be market-based (e.g. carbon taxes, emission trading schemes, renewable subsidies) or non-market-based (for example, vehicle emission limits, bans on certain chemicals, water quality standards)</li>
  <li>technological change and product evolution – for example, rapid advances in renewable energy technology is reducing costs and threatening the cost-competitiveness of fossil fuels</li>
  <li>changes in customer demand and social norms – prompted by environmental concerns, either voluntarily, or in response to, or anticipation of, policy changes</li>
  <li>reputational damage – caused by failing to meet public expectations and/or legislative requirements</li>
  <li>shareholder sentiment – businesses that are seen as environmentally risky or inconsistent with a low carbon future may become unpopular with investors (for example, high profile campaigns are encouraging divestment from fossil fuels)</li>
  <li>business disruption – for example, caused by damage to business premises, infrastructure or the transport network, affecting the business directly or its suppliers and customers</li>
  <li>fines and litigation risk – climate change is a new source of litigation risk as people affected by climate change, or organisations campaigning on their behalf, seek compensation</li>
</ul>

<p>60. As schemes rely on sponsor contributions for many years into the future, trustee assessments of their sponsor covenant should be forward-looking, taking account of the impact of potential medium and long-term climate scenarios on the employer business (considering both transition and physical risks) and the market in which it operates.</p>

<p>61. Trustees should consider their sponsor’s business resilience in the face of future uncertainties. This might involve exploring the employer’s risk management processes, including how it identifies emerging risks and factors them into long-term business planning. Where applicable, trustees may wish to consider the appropriateness of the sponsor providing information to the trustees (or their professional covenant assessors) in line with the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommended disclosures.</p>

<p>62. Emphasis should also be placed on qualitative information, including information about the employer values and culture in relation to climate issues and risk management.</p>

<p>63. Trustees may wish to consider raising the following questions with their sponsoring employer<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what are the main climate-related risks faced by the business over the short, medium and long-term?</li>
  <li>how does the company identify, assess and mitigate these risks?</li>
  <li>what climate-related risks might affect business viability over the term of the scheme’s recovery plan and long-term funding target?</li>
  <li>how does the company seek to achieve a resilient business model which is robust to a wide range of potential climate scenarios?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2. </span> The role of the covenant adviser</h3>

<p>64. In selecting a covenant advisor, trustees should ensure that the prospective adviser demonstrates an understanding of the issues and the possible impact that climate change could have on the sponsor. Ideally, they would also be able to demonstrate tools to incorporate these risks into their assessment of covenant, and suggestions for how risks might be mitigated.</p>

<p>65. Potential advisors should be able to demonstrate an ability to work with management teams to source and interpret information. As always in <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> pensions, it is crucial that advisers are able to provide advice which can be integrated into a scheme’s investment, funding, legal and administration advice.</p>

<p>66. Trustees of larger schemes should ensure that such skills and knowledge are held within their proposed delivery team and not drawn purely from ‘specialists’ who will not be part of core services.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3. </span> Taking account of climate issues in <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> funding</h3>

<p>67. As for any area of risk, the funding implications of climate issues on <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes are affected by the covenant and investment implications and vice versa. For example, a scheme that is actively managing climate-related risks to its investments and has a sponsor with relatively low exposure to climate-related risks, may conclude that no adjustments are needed to the current financial assumptions.</p>

<p>68. Conversely, scheme actuaries may want to suggest a more prudent funding approach in schemes where mitigation of climate-related risks is not explicitly addressed in the trustees’ investment strategy or where climate-related risks are a major source of covenant risk.</p>

<p>69. More broadly, scheme liabilities may be affected through wider financial and mortality assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actuaries use market yields when setting financial assumptions, and compare the resulting value of liabilities with a market value of assets. Where markets are not pricing climate-related risks correctly (or are underestimating the downside risks) this may have a knock-on effect on financial assumptions</li>
  <li>current mortality rate assumptions are affected by environmental factors such as cold winters and poor air quality, and these effects are reflected in the data used to construct base tables and initial rates of mortality improvement. Assumptions may, however, be impacted by climate-related issues. This may go wider than the direct effects of rising temperatures and more extreme weather events. Other factors may have an effect such as increasing energy prices and a resource-constrained economy. Conversely efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions may improve health.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup> All of these effects are difficult to quantify, however and impacts may vary by age and location</li>
</ul>

<p>70. Given the uncertainty surrounding these effects, trustees may wish to consider asking their actuaries to illustrate a range of possible financial assumptions and mortality improvements in their advice, taking into account different potential climate scenarios.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup></p>

<p>71. Buy-out funding targets for schemes may also be affected as insurers start to price in climate impacts, although anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been little, if any, impact on annuity pricing to date.</p>

<ul>
  <li>trustees should seek to inform members of actions taken to manage climate-related risks and opportunities across their portfolios</li>

<span class="number">5.1. </span> Disclosure</h3>

<p>72. Preparing for public reporting in line with the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations may help trustees meet other existing and forthcoming regulatory disclosure requirements around climate change.</p>

<p>73. Subject to consultation and Parliamentary approval, Government regulations will come into force from 1 October 2021. Trustees can consider the following approaches to publishing <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>-aligned disclosures based on whether or not they are in scope of the requirements:</p>

<table>

      <td>- publish a <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> report on a publicly available website and make it accessible free of charge<br>- reference the report from the scheme’s Annual Report<br>- tell members via the annual benefit statement (and the annual funding statement for <abbr title="defined benefit">DB</abbr> schemes) that the information has been published and where they can locate it<br>- incorporate <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr>-aligned disclosures into one or more other forms of member communication (such as member newsletters or a responsible investment report)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>74. Regardless of which of the above approaches are used for disclosure, the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommends that climate-related financial disclosures should be subject to appropriate governance processes “that are the same or substantially similar to those used for financial reporting.”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup></p>

<p>75. The <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> offers further guidance on how to make the 11 recommended disclosures, noting that “When used by organisations in preparing their climate-related financial disclosures, these principles can help achieve high-quality and decision-useful disclosures that enable users to understand the impact of climate change on their organisations”. Trustees should consider the following principles when deciding upon and reviewing their climate-related financial disclosures:</p>

<h4>Auditing</h4>

<p>76. The reasonable level of assurance provided by the auditors in their audit report relates only to the financial statements included with a company’s Annual report, not to the Annual report as a whole. With limited exception<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup> the auditor does not, in their audit of the financial statements, provide an assurance opinion on the ‘Other Information’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup> included in the Annual Report.</p>

<p>77. Therefore, trustees do not need to secure additional auditors assurance as a result of including the disclosures in the Annual Report. However, Trustees may still wish to ask to have their <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> reports audited to provide further confidence that they are both accurate and complete.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2. </span> Member communication</h3>

<p>78. Communicating clearly with members on how climate-related risks and opportunities are being managed can also help build trust and public confidence, especially as members’ interest in climate change continues to escalate. The UK Stewardship Code also requires signatories to communicate the activities and outcomes of their stewardship and investment (see chapter 3).</p>

<p>79. In addition to public reporting, trustees can consider including more tailored member communication on climate change in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular newsletters</li>
  <li>online content including social media</li>
  <li>member events and representative programs</li>
</ul>

<p>80. Trustees interested in improving their member communications on important topics like climate change are encouraged to read ShareAction’s report, “Pensions for the Next Generation: Communicating What Matters”.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup> Trustees should also read <abbr title="Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association">PLSA</abbr>’s “Implementation Statement Guidance for Trustees”<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:36" rel="footnote">[footnote 36]</a></sup> which includes a specific chapter on how to produce clear, effective and meaningful disclosures on voting behaviour in the Implementation Statement.</p>

<h2>Appendix 1 – Enquiries to make of asset managers</h2>

<p>Trustees should be careful to ensure that the products and services they buy are genuinely managing climate risk. They need to be able to identify and avoid greenwash.</p>

<p>As with any other investment or governance issues, they should not be afraid to dig deeper, keep asking questions and challenge what they hear. They should also be willing to move the discussion onto their own territory. How do the managers’ strategies and outcomes reflect the trustees’ own investment beliefs, stewardship and investment policies? Rather than allow fund managers to pick their own case studies, what engagement and voting do they carry out in relation to the firms chosen by the trustees.</p>

<p>In line with their fiduciary duty, trustees should rigorously assess the capabilities and approach to climate management of new and existing managers. Below we have included a ‘Top 10’ list of questions to prioritise when assessing asset managers, and a list of further questions structured in line with the <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> recommendations.</p>

<h3>Top 10</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Has the manager produced a <abbr title="Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures">TCFD</abbr> report which outlines their governance of climate related issues? (Governance)</li>
  <li>Will the manager share climate-related scenario analysis undertaken as part of their investment process? (Strategy)</li>
  <li>Do they support shareholder resolutions on climate change - if so, how many, which ones, and what was the rationale for their decision? (Strategy)</li>

<h2>Appendix 2 – Guide for assessing climate competency of Investment Consultants</h2>

<p>The guide sets out five themes against which trustees should expect their Investment Consultants to demonstrate their climate competency. Examples of positive and best practice indicators are included against each theme to help judge competency.  The indicators are deliberately stretching with the aim of raising investment consultants’ standards and it should be acknowledged that some of these indicators will be aspirational.</p>

<p>As with assessing asset managers, trustees should ask their Investment Consultants for evidence of action to support their reported competencies.  Trustees should test the depth of application and integration of these climate competencies in the services they receive from their Investment Consultants.  This guide is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>This guide has been prepared by the Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group (<abbr title="Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group">ICSWG</abbr>), with helpful input from independent parties including ShareAction, The Pensions Regulator and the UN <abbr title="Principles for Responsible Investment">PRI</abbr>.  The <abbr title="Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group">ICSWG</abbr> is a collaboration between 17 firms formed in 2020 taking action to support and accelerate sustainable investment initiatives in the UK. The <abbr title="Investment Consultants Sustainability Working Group">ICSWG</abbr> members are:</p>
