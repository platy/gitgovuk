<p>Every organisation that delivers charitable activities has a responsibility to safeguard people from harm or abuse, whether they are staff members, volunteers, or people supported by the charity.</p>

<p>This guidance will help you report safeguarding concerns about the behaviour or actions of a charity employee or volunteer.</p>

<h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> When you’ve been told something</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Action must be taken no matter if the information you received is non-recent or from an anonymous source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must make appropriate referrals and consultations to your local Safeguarding Adults Board or Safeguarding Children Partnership within 24 hours. If you are unsure if this is required, please contact them as you should take action promptly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always make sure the person speaking up feels they’re being listened to and supported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t promise to keep information confidential between you and them. Refer to and follow your organisation’s policy and procedures to make sure information is only shared with people who need and have the right to know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is an immediate risk then action should be taken to put safeguarding measures in place, for example the suspension of the individual that this concerns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Have you written a clear statement of what you have been told, seen, or heard?</h3>

<p>If your charity does not have specific procedures in place use our guides to help with recording safeguarding concerns:</p>

<div class="example">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/safeguarding/steps-to-a-safer-organisation/policies-and-procedures" rel="external">Guide to writing reporting policies and procedures</a></p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-duties-for-charity-trustees">Checking your charity’s policies, procedures and practice</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Have you spoken to the relevant people in your charity about any concerns?</h3>

<p>If you are a volunteer or employee we advise you speak to all the relevant people in your charity as they can help with the handling and internal processes. If your charity has a safeguarding lead, you should speak to them in the first instance.</p>

<p>If you are unsure who this is, or if your charity does not have a safeguarding lead this guidance explains about the roles and responsibilities:</p>

<div class="example">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://test.knowhownonprofit.org/safeguarding/steps-to-a-safer-organisation/roles-and-responsibilities" rel="external">Understanding roles and responsibilities</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Have you spoken to your local Safeguarding Adults Board or Safeguarding Children Partnership?</h3>

<p>The Boards publish policies and procedures in their area and provide other support. Contact your local Safeguarding Adults Board or Safeguarding Children Partnership for more information.</p>

<p>You must make appropriate referrals and consultations to your local Safeguarding Adults Board or Safeguarding Children Partnership within 24 hours. If you are unsure if this is required talk to your appropriate agency, as you must take action promptly.</p>

<h3>Have the actions observed or described met the threshold for statutory involvement?</h3>

<p>Your local Safeguarding Adults Board or Safeguarding Children Partnership will assist you in understanding if your concern reaches the threshold for involvement. If you do do not hear back from them you should contact them again to request an update on progress.</p>

<h3>Questions to consider if the actions do not meet the threshold for statutory involvement?</h3>

<p>There are things you must consider when the matter does not meet the statutory threshold, or it has been passed back your charity to deal with internally. If your charity has a safeguarding lead, they can help with the handling and internal processes.</p>

<p>You may also re-refer a case at any point of your internal processes, if new concerns arise which may change case direction.</p>

<h4>Have you made the individual aware of the information received?</h4>

<p>You should not inform the person about whom there is a concern until you have taken advice. Individual refers to the person who the safeguarding concern is about</p>

<h4>Have you offered them the right to respond?</h4>

<p>Depending on your concern this may or may not be appropriate. You should not inform the person about whom there is concern until you have taken advice</p>

<h4>Do any follow up referrals need to be undertaken?</h4>

<h4>Has a decision been made on the individual’s ongoing involvement with the charity?</h4>

<p>You must make a clear decision on the individual’s suitability to continue their role in your charity. Some of the actions below will depend on your role and responsibilities in your organisation. If you are in doubt, speak to the relevant people within your organisation. If you have a safeguarding lead in your charity, you should speak to them in the first instance.</p>

<h4>Is this a ‘serious incident’ which requires Charity Commission to be notified?</h4>

<p>A serious incident is an adverse event, whether actual or alleged, which results in or risks significant: harm to your charity’s beneficiaries, staff, volunteers or others who come into contact with your charity through its work.</p>

<h4>Do you need to inform other external governing bodies such as OFSTED?</h4>

<h4>Does the individual need further training and support?</h4>

<p>Get the right support and help for you to improve safeguarding in your organisation.</p>

<h4>Does the individual need to be dismissed or has resigned?</h4>

<p>Dismissal requires a DBS referral. If the individual resigned during at any point during the process this requires a DBS referral</p>
