<h3>HMRC’s support for customers who need extra help</h3>

<p>HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-charter/hmrcs-principles-of-support-for-customers-who-need-extra-help">principles of support for customers who need extra help</a> set out our commitment to support customers according to their needs, and underpin the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-charter">HMRC Charter</a>.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-hmrc-extra-support">how to get help and the extra support available</a>.</p>

<h2><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr></h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreements — introducing new digital version of the PSA1 form</h3>
<p>HMRC has recently completed a review of customer feedback from employers who make use of <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreements. Acting on that feedback we have redesigned the PSA1 form in line with your needs. We have also introduced a more efficient digital submission route. The new form is available from <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-paye-settlement-agreement-psa1"><abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement (PSA1)</a>.</p>

<p>HMRC encourages all employers to take up the new reporting method. This is the most efficient way to submit PSA1 and is HMRC’s preferred method of receiving it.</p>

<p>The new digital format offers many benefits for employers. These include easy, standardised reporting, improved accuracy, speedier processing times and fewer resulting queries.</p>

<p>If using the paper version, employers may have to complete more than one PSA1 depending on where employees live. The new digital PSA1 will allow employers to submit one form for all employees regardless of their location.</p>

<h3>Payment deadline and calculation reminder</h3>
<p>You must pay any tax and National Insurance owed under a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement by 22 October after the tax year to which the <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement applies (19 October if you pay by post). ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-psa">Pay a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement’</a> gives more information on how to pay.</p>

<p>You may incur a penalty or be charged interest if you do not pay, or your payment is late.</p>

<p>You also must send your calculation to HMRC. The <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-paye-settlement-agreement-psa1">PSA1 calculation form</a> is available. You must submit a calculation even if you have no amount due to pay.</p>

<p>If HMRC approves your <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Settlement Agreement before the start of a tax year, you can include any expenses and benefits contained in the agreement. If they approve it after the start of the tax year, you might need to report some items separately.</p>

<h3>Employers <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> — introduction of variable payment plan</h3>
<p>From 3 October 2022, in response to customer feedback, employers’ <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> customers will be able to take advantage of a new variable Direct Debit payment plan.</p>

<p>The service can be accessed through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-paye-tax">Pay employers’ <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr></a> or directly through the business tax account and the employers <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> service.</p>

<p>There will be changes to the business tax account and the employers’ liabilities and payments screens on the employers <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> service. A new link ‘Set up a Direct Debit’ will be introduced and this will allow customers to set up a Direct Debit instruction, authorising HMRC to collect direct from their bank account based on their return submissions.</p>

<p>Following set up, the link will change to ‘Manage your Direct Debit’ and an employer will be able to view, change or cancel the Direct Debit online.</p>

<p>The facility to create, view, amend and cancel a Direct Debit is restricted to employers only, there is no scope for agents to do this.</p>

<p>If signed up to variable payment plan, the following charges will be collected on receipt of the returns to HMRC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full Payment Submission</li>
  <li>Employer Payment Summary</li>
  <li>Construction Industry Scheme</li>
  <li>Apprenticeship Levy</li>
  <li>Class 1A National Insurance</li>
  <li>Earlier Year Update</li>
</ul>

<h3>First Full Payment Submission for new starters: the importance of using the correct employee addresses — correction</h3>
<p>This article was originally published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-revenue-and-customs-employer-bulletin">in the June 2022 Employer Bulletin</a> with incorrect guidance around what to do when receiving a late P45.</p>

<p>When completing the first Full Payment Submission for new starters it is important that you obtain and enter your employee’s correct address and postcode and use the employee’s P45 information to record their previous pay, tax and student loan (if applicable).</p>

<p>If the employee does not have a P45 you can use the following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-starter-checklist">starter checklist for <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If you use the starter checklist to add the employee onto your payroll records and you receive the P45 after you have received a tax code from HMRC, you do not need to update the previous pay, tax, or tax code on your payroll software, only update student loan details (if applicable).</p>

<p>Using the correct postcode and address is important because HMRC uses the postcode to verify the employee’s address. If you enter an incorrect address or postcode this could result in the employee’s address being changed on our systems leading to correspondence being issued to the wrong address. An incorrect address held on HMRC’s systems may also affect the Department for Work and Pensions ability to process Universal Credit claims and issue correspondence to claimants.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates and information</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> deferred due to COVID-19 — act now to avoid a penalty</h3>

<p>HMRC will support any taxpayer in financial distress as a result of COVID-19. Contact us as soon as possible if you are struggling to pay your deferred <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> to make an arrangement to pay.</p>

<p>Businesses that deferred <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> payments due between 20 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 were able to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay in full by 31 March 2021</li>

<h2>Tax updates and changes to Guidance</h2>

<h3>Tax avoidance — don’t get caught out</h3>
<p>HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://taxavoidanceexplained.campaign.gov.uk/?&amp;utm_source=emp_bull&amp;utm_medium=stk&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_" rel="external">‘Tax avoidance — don’t get caught out’</a> campaign helps contractors to spot the signs of tax avoidance, understand the financial risks and check their pay arrangements to prevent an unexpected tax bill.</p>

<p>A ‘contractor’ is someone who provides services to clients that do not directly engage them. This may be through an ‘umbrella company’, an agency, a partnership, or their own company, such as a Personal Service Company. This applies to employed and self-employed individuals.</p>

<p>To support your contractors and agency workers, we ask that you keep sharing the campaign messages and signpost them to:</p>

<h3>Employees applying for a certificate of liability to pay Social Security contributions only in the UK — new attachment facility</h3>
<p>We have now extended the attachment facility to all five of our forms for employees applying online for a certificate of liability to pay Social Security contributions only in the UK while working abroad. Previously only 2 of these forms had this facility.</p>

<p>This means that 64-8s and any supporting information may now be attached at the time when any of these forms are submitted online. This will help improve processing of applications and is one of the improvements we are making following the recent research HMRC commissioned Kantar to carry out with employers.</p>

<h3>Bringing commercial goods into Great Britain&nbsp;in baggage — moving to the Customs Declaration Service to submit declarations</h3>
<p>After 30 September 2022, the Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system will close for import declarations.</p>

<p>Business travellers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bringing-commercial-goods-into-great-britainin-your-baggage">bringing commercial goods into Great Britain&nbsp;in baggage</a> after 30 September 2022 will need to submit their declarations through the Customs Declaration Service — either individually or through a customs agent.</p>

<h3>New Tax Residence Indicator tool</h3>
<p>HMRC has launched a new tool to help customers to determine their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-foreign-income/residence">tax residence status</a>.</p>

<p>The tool applies the rules as set out in the Statutory Residence Test (<abbr title="Statutory Residence Test">SRT</abbr>) to help determine an individual’s residence status for tax purposes. Guidance on the <abbr title="Statutory Residence Test">SRT</abbr> can be found here in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rdr3-statutory-residence-test-srt">RDR3: Statutory Residence Test notes</a>.</p>

<p>The tool is suitable for most people whose affairs are straightforward and covers the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatic overseas test</li>
  <li>automatic UK tests</li>
  <li>sufficient ties test</li>
</ul>

<p>For detailed information on the Statutory Residence Test read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis/rdrm11000">Residence, Domicile and Remittance Basis Manual from RDRM11000 onwards</a>.</p>

<h2>General information and customer support</h2>

<h3>New professions able to issue fit notes</h3>
<p>New legislation to allow a wider range of healthcare professionals to certify fit notes has been introduced by the UK government.</p>

<p>From 1 July, nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists, and physiotherapists are all able to legally certify fit notes in addition to doctors.</p>

<p>This change does not otherwise alter the purpose and function of the fit note. It will continue to support and empower better conversations about work and health between employers and staff. This change makes it easier to get advice certified by the most relevant healthcare professional.</p>

<p>These professionals should be working within general practice or delivering NHS services as access to the new version of the fit note is limited to these settings.</p>

<p>Updated guidance and training for the healthcare professionals in scope has been delivered, and updated guidance for employers and patients is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fit-note">fit note</a>.</p>

<h3>Pension Credit — help your employees to understand who might be eligible</h3>
<p>Pension Credit is designed to help people over State Pension age and on a low income. Share this information with your employees, as they may be eligible themselves or have family or friends who could receive support.</p>

<p>Pension Credit could provide on average around £3,300 extra income a year. But around one third of those eligible for Pension Credit are not claiming it, which is around 850,000 households. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is running a campaign to encourage those pensioners on low income to claim Pension Credits.</p>

<p>Those who are eligible can also claim other benefits too, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help with housing costs including heating bills</li>
  <li>free NHS dental care and glasses</li>
  <li>travel costs to hospital appointments</li>
  <li>free TV licence for those over 75</li>
</ul>

<h3>Organised labour fraud</h3>
<p>Organised labour fraud is the collective name HMRC gives to three main frauds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>labour fraud in construction</li>
  <li>mini-umbrella company fraud</li>
  <li>payroll company fraud</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s ‘organised’ because it is orchestrated and conducted by organised crime groups. It’s ‘labour fraud’ because it always involves a genuine supply of labour.</p>

<p>HMRC groups the three frauds together because they share similar features. Organised labour fraud may grow to include other types of fraud where a labour supply is at the heart of the business operation.</p>

<h4>Labour fraud in construction</h4>

<p>HMRC defines this as the fraudulent use of contrived labour supply chains in the construction industry. It involves the abuse of the Construction Industry Scheme to move labour-related <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> (not subject to the Domestic Reverse Charge) and Income Tax liabilities into shell companies that go missing or default owing a debt to HMRC.</p>

<h4>Mini-umbrella company fraud</h4>

<p>This is an employment intermediary model which fragments a temporary workforce, who would typically be supplied by a single umbrella company, into many small, limited companies each with a few employees. Each of the micro companies may fraudulently claim Employment Allowance and, or abuse the <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> Flat Rate Scheme. These are both government incentives aimed at helping small businesses.</p>

<h4>Payroll company fraud</h4>

<p>This is when an active business transfers staff, along with payroll responsibilities, to a fraudulent entity. This entity purports to be a ‘payroll company’. The ‘payroll company’ then supplies the staff back to the business but fails to pay Income Tax, National Insurance and <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> to HMRC.</p>

<h4>Common themes</h4>

<p>All 3 frauds share some common traits, some shared by all 3 and others may be specific to just 2. Here are a few examples from a lengthy list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fraudulent businesses in the labour supply chain have a short life span — sometimes as little as 12 months — they will then be abandoned or become insolvent — another entity will then take their place</li>

<h4>Impact on workers</h4>

<p>With these types of fraud there is always an impact on the workers that affects their employment rights and may impact on their ability to claim benefits in the future.</p>

<h4>HMRC’s response</h4>

<p>Such fraudulent behaviour steals the vital revenue that funds UK public services. HMRC is committed to tackling organised labour fraud and supporting the victims.</p>

<h4>HMRC’s ask</h4>

<p>HMRC recommends that businesses apply the due diligence principles when they receive a supply of labour. This can be broken down into ‘Check, Act and Review’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check — know the risks: legal, financial, tax and the social obligations of suppliers</li>
  <li>Act — conduct robust due diligence on suppliers and act to mitigate or remove risks</li>
  <li>Review — effective due diligence requires continuous monitoring and review</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC also recommends that individuals register for their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account">Personal Tax Account</a>.</p>

<p>Regular checking ensures that the information shown there is accurate.</p>
