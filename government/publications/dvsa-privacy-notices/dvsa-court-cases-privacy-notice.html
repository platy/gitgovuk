DfT’s registration number is Z7122992</p>

<h2>

  <li>name of the instructor and instructor’s personal reference number (if necessary)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Small claims court proceeding</h3>

<p>The personal data we collect from parties to a small claims court proceeding include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>driving licence number</li>
  <li>driving test information such as date, time and location of test, category of test</li>
  <li>bank account details to arrange any payment (where necessary)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Personal injury claim</h3>

<p>The personal data we collect from parties to a personal injury claim include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>

  <li>medical test reports containing the nature of the mental or physical condition, treatment and prognosis</li>
  <li>any witness information such as name and address</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Other court proceedings</h3>

<p>The personal data we collect from parties to other court proceedings in which <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is the defendant include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>

  <li>staff number</li>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Legal basis</h3>

<p>The legal basis for processing this data is a legal obligation. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part32" rel="external">Part 32 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998</a> sets out the legal requirements.</p>

<p>When a claim goes to court, the law says we have to disclose any relevant documents that we hold. It’s a right in law that someone in regulatory proceedings is allowed to see any documents which might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support their case</li>
  <li>tend to undermine our case as the regulator</li>
</ul>

<p>We would be very likely to contravene the right to a fair hearing under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 47 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights if we did not disclose the documents.</p>

<p>It’s a basic aspect of the right to a fair trial that the parties are allowed to see all relevant evidence, except where public interest immunity applies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Why we need it</h2>

<p>We will process your personal data as part of the preparation for the defence of any appeals, small claims court and personal injury claims brought against <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>As part of our defence, we will review data we hold which is relevant to the case and any reports we hold about the alleged incident or test.</p>

<p>These cases are regularly brought against the agency by the complainant or appellant who has already provided their personal information to the courts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What we do with it</h2>

<p>We collect, use and store the data you give us for the reasons set out in this policy.</p>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
  <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>Personal data collected is shared with the Government Legal Department (GLD) who provide legal advice to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> and with external counsel or lawyers who are engaged by GLD to represent the agency.</p>

<p>We will share your data if required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How long we keep your data</h2>

<p>We’ll only keep your personal data for as long as it is needed for the reasons set out in this policy or as long as is required by law.</p>

<p>We will hold your personal data for no later than 20 years after we close our file. This is normally once the court has made a decision or any settlement awarded has been paid.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Where it might go</h2>

<p>Paper records are either kept securely within locked cabinets in <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> offices or are securely stored by our contracted records management provider in the UK.</p>

<p>Electronic records are held on <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> servers currently hosted in the UK or hosted on the cloud from servers based within the EEA.</p>

<p>Third-party storage suppliers are bound by contracts which detail what they can do with the data they hold and as they are based within the EEA are bound by the same Data Protection legislation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Protecting your data and your rights</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-standards-agency/about/personal-information-charter"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> personal information charter</a> sets out what steps are taken to protect your data, and the rights you have over your data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Automated decision making and profiling</h2>

<p>Your data is not subject to automated decision making or profiling as defined in data protection legislation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Changes to this notice</h2>

<p>We may change this privacy notice at its discretion at any time.</p>

<p>When we change this notice, the date on the page will be updated.  Any changes to this privacy notice will be applied to you and your data as of the revision date.</p>

<p>We encourage you to periodically review this privacy notice to be informed about how your data is protected.</p>
