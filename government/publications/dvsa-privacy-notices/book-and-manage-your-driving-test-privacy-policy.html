<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>About this service</h2>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) provides the service to book and manage your driving test. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT).</p>

<p>We carry out driving tests in Great Britain. This service lets you choose the date, time and driving test centre you want to take your driving test. It also lets you change your appointment or cancel it.</p>

<p>The data controller for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is DfT - a data controller determines the reasons and how personal data is processed.

DfT’s registration number is  Z7122992.</p>

<p>We may use GOV.UK Notify to send you emails or text messages about your driving test. This is a service provided by the Government Digital Service, which is part of the Cabinet Office. We are the data controller for your data within that service. The Cabinet Office is the data processor.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What we do with it</h2>

We’ll do this either by using one of our shredders or we will use an external company called Restore DataShred to securely destroy it on our behalf.</p>
