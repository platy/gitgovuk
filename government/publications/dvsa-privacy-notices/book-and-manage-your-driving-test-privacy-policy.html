<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>About this service</h2>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) provides the service to book and manage your driving test. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT).</p>

<p>We carry out driving tests in Great Britain. This service lets you choose the date, time and driving test centre you want to take your driving test. It also lets you change your appointment or cancel it.</p>

<p>The data controller for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is DfT - a data controller determines the reasons and how personal data is processed.

DfT’s registration number is  Z7122992.</p>

<p>We may use GOV.UK Notify to send you emails or text messages about your driving test. This is a service provided by the Government Digital Service, which is part of the Cabinet Office. We are the data controller for your data within that service. The Cabinet Office is the data processor.</p>

<ul>
  <li>check you’re entitled to take a driving test</li>

</ul>

<p>We shall also use your data and that of other candidates presented for test by your instructor to produce your instructor with driver test analysis reports. This data will be anonymised.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What we do with it</h2>

</ul>

<p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

<p>If you pass your driving test, we will share your data with DVLA so they can issue you with a full driving licence. We shall also securely destroy your provisional licence if you’ve agreed for us to do so. We’ll do this either by using one of our shredders or we will use an external company called Restore DataShred to securely destroy it on our behalf.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>All data related to coronavirus (COVID-19) has been deleted in line with guidance from the Cabinet Office. Where contact tracing is still in place, for example in Wales, we still hold data. Appropriate action will be taken when further advice is given.</p>
</div>

  <li>electronic copies of your driving test report for 5 years - including a record of whether we passed your information to the NHS for coronavirus tracing</li>
  <li>paper copies of your driving test for 2 years</li>
</ul>

<p>We only hold your personal data shared by DVLA to check you’re eligible to take a driving test for 10 days from the date you book your test.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Where it might go</h2>

<p>Our IT infrastructure and technology has been checked to make sure it’s safe and secure.</p>

<p>All your data is held on <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> servers based in the UK or hosted within cloud servers (Amazon Web Services) in Ireland.</p>
