<h2>

<p>We will tell <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> when you become an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr>. They will then tell us if you get any motoring convictions. This is because being an <abbr title="approved driving instructor">ADI</abbr> is considered as a ‘notifiable occupation’ for motoring convictions.</p>

<p>We will share your data with the driving instructor associations who are members of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://n-a-s-p.co.uk/" rel="external">National Associations Strategic Partnership</a> (NASP).

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>All data related to coronavirus (COVID-19) has been deleted in line with guidance from the cabinet office. Where contact tracing is still in place, for example in Wales, we still hold data. Appropriate action will be taken when further advice is given</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How long we keep your data</h2>

  <li>5 years if we have passed your information to the NHS for coronavirus tracing</li>
  <li>10 years from the last activity when its held on our system</li>
