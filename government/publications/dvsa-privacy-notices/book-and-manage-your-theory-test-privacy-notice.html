<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>About this service</h2>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) provides the service to book and manage your driving test. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT).</p>

<p>We carry out theory tests in Great Britain. This service lets you choose the date, time and theory test centre you want to take your theory test at. It also lets you change your appointment or cancel it.</p>

<p>The data controller for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is DfT - a data controller determines the reasons and how personal data is processed. For more information see the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7122992" rel="external">Data Protection Public Register</a>. DfT’s registration number is  Z7122992.</p>

<p>We may use GOV.UK Notify to send you emails or text messages about your theory test. This is a service provided by the Government Digital Service, which is part of the Cabinet Office. We are the data controller for your data within that service. The Cabinet Office is the data processor.</p>

<h2>

</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Why we needed it</h2>

<p>We needed the personal data we collected from you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check you’re entitled to take a theory test</li>
  <li>book your theory test appointment</li>
  <li>take the payment for your theory test and give you a refund if you cancel your test giving 3 clear working days’ notice (Sundays and public holidays do not count as working days)</li>
  <li>send you a confirmation of your appointment</li>
  <li>contact you if we needed to change your test appointment or let you know about disruption to our services</li>
  <li>contact you if the way the theory test works is changing, and you need the information to properly prepare for your test</li>
  <li>carry out your theory test - including making any reasonable adjustments for any disability, health condition or learning difficulty</li>
  <li>give you your test result</li>
  <li>record your test result so we know if you’re eligible to take your driving test</li>
  <li>produce anonymised statistics and</li>
  <li>ask you to take part in research projects to help us understand how easy our services are to use and how we improve road safety</li>
  <li>where local guidance exists, be able to send your information to the appropriate organisation if a theory test centre member of staff tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What we do with it</h2>

<p>We collect, use and store the data you give us for the reasons set out in this policy.</p>

<p>Pearson VUE acts as our data processor to administer and carry out theory tests. They are allowed to collect and process personal data on our behalf.</p>

<p>Our contract with Pearson VUE says they must make sure any of their subcontractors meet the same data protection requirements and standards.</p>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
  <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>We will share your data if we are required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>All data related to coronavirus (COVID-19) has been deleted in line with guidance from the Cabinet Office. Where contact tracing is still in place, for example in Wales, we still hold data. Appropriate action will be taken when further advice is given.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How long we keep your data</h2>

<p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as it is needed for the reasons set out in this policy or for as long as is required by law.</p>

<p>We will hold your personal data for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30 months to administer your theory test booking, including checking you’re eligible to take the test</li>
  <li>7 years for your payment details</li>
  <li>42 months for data about your Safe Road User Award, if you have one</li>
</ul>

<p>We will hold personal data about you and your behaviour that’s a threat to our staff or other candidates for whichever of these is the shortest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>until you’ve passed your theory test</li>
  <li>until you’ve failed your theory test, but didn’t display any further abusive behaviour</li>
  <li>2 years since your last test, unless you’ve been charged with a criminal offence - in this case, your data is kept until you pass your theory test</li>
  <li>where a quarterly review shows the threat you pose has reduced</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Where it might go</h2>

<p>Our IT infrastructure and technology has been checked to make sure it is safe and secure.</p>

<p>Pearson VUE is allowed to collect and process personal information in both the UK and the USA.</p>

<p>We have agreed standard contractual clauses for data processing outside of the European Economic Area. Pearson VUE has signed up to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/Individuals-in-Europe" rel="external">EU-US Privacy Shield Framework</a>.</p>

<p>Pearson VUE has its own separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www9.pearsonvue.com/legal/appprivacy/" rel="external">privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>Pearson VUE will share your theory test result with us so you can book your driving test.</p>
