<span class="number">1. </span>About this activity</h2>

<p>The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) uses an operator compliance risk score (<abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr>) system to decide which vehicles to inspect.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is an executive agency of the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>).</p>

<p>We calculate the risk of an operator not following the rules on roadworthiness (the condition of its vehicles) and traffic, for example drivers’ hours or weighing checks, to decide which vehicles to inspect.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr> risk scores are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>green - low risk operator</li>
  <li>amber - medium risk operator</li>
  <li>red - high risk operator</li>
  <li>grey - unknown operator</li>
  <li>blue - earned recognition operator</li>
</ul>

<p>The data controller for <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> - a data controller determines the reasons and how personal data is processed. For more information, see the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner's Office">ICO</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7122992" rel="external">Data Protection Public Register</a>. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s registration number is Z7122992.</p>

<p>The legal basis for processing this data is legal obligation.</p>

<p>Article 9 (risk rating system) of Directive 2006/22/EC requires <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> to have a risk rating system with those who present the highest risk being inspected more closely.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Why we need it</h2>

<p>We need the personal data we collect from you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>create and provide operator details and risk rating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact you based on your <abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr> score</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide which vehicles to inspect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>carry out analysis of the data and identify trends</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrange for a desk or fleet assessment of your vehicles</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr> is primarily used as an operational targeting tool. The score and the data within it that identifies road safety risks, may be used for other road safety interventions – potentially by correspondence – where necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What we do with it</h2>

<p>We collect, use, and store the data you give us for the reasons set out in this policy.</p>

<p>We will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sell or rent your data to third parties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We share data with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Freight Compliance Unit comprising:
    <ul>
      <li>Transport for London</li>
      <li>The Metropolitan Police where they request data and receive details of the operator’s banding</li>
      <li>City of London Police</li>
      <li>Surrey Police</li>
      <li>Essex Police</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Environment Agency</li>
  <li>Office of the Traffic Commissioner</li>
  <li>Transport Regulation Unit (Northern Ireland)</li>
  <li>Driver and Vehicle Agency (Northern Ireland)</li>
</ul>

<p>We will share your data if required to do so by law - for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How long we keep your data</h2>

<p>We’ll only keep your personal data for as long as it is needed for the reasons set out in this policy or as long as is required by law.</p>

<p>We will hold your personal data for up to 7 years.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Where it might go</h2>

<p>Our IT infrastructure and technology has been checked to make sure it’s safe and secure. Our servers are managed by Amazon Web Services and are located in Ireland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Protecting your data and your rights</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-standards-agency/about/personal-information-charter"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> personal information charter</a> sets out what steps are taken to protect your data, and the rights you have over your data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Automated decision making and profiling</h2>

<p>Your data is not subject to profiling as defined in data protection legislation.</p>

<p>Your data is used, however, to determine your <abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr> rating. This is a points-based system with your score determined by a series of rules. Those rules are based on events, such as positive and negative events. These positive and negative events are classed as personal data when associated with an individual, and are logged on our systems to enable the automated decision making process.</p>

<p>The result of this automated decision making process will produce your <abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr> rating - red, amber, green, grey or blue. The rating produced will determine if your vehicles need to be inspected or if a desk or fleet assessment of your vehicles needs to be arranged.</p>

<p>The risk level of an operator is taken from their base score. The ‘base score’ decides which <abbr title="Operator compliance risk score">OCRS</abbr> band they fall into.</p>

<p>The ‘base score’ is worked out over a 3-year rolling period by dividing the total number of negative event points by the total number of all events. A weighting is applied to each year’s score with older events attracting a lower points value.</p>

<p>Operators get more points for more serious defects or infringements.</p>

<p>You can request a manual review of the automated decision by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dataprotection@dvsa.gov.uk">dataprotection@dvsa.gov.uk</a>. If you request this, the data entered on our systems, including positive and negative events, will be used to manually recalculate your rating.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Changes to this notice</h2>

<p>We may change this privacy notice at our discretion at any time.</p>

<p>When we change this notice, the date on the page will be updated. Any changes to this privacy notice will be applied to you and your data as of the revision date.</p>
