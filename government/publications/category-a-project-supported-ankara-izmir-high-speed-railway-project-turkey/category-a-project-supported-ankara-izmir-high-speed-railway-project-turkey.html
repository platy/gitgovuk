<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Nature of <abbr title="environmental, social and human rights">ESHR</abbr> impacts</h2>
<p>The review of potential <abbr title="environmental, social and human rights">ESHR</abbr> risks and impacts took into account the following impacts, receptors and issues during the construction and operational phases of the Project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>physical and economic displacement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>critical habitats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>occupational health and safety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>emissions to the atmosphere (including land, air and water)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>air and noise impacts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wastewater treatment</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>construction camp conditions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grievance mechanisms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>community engagement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Assessment of <abbr title="environmental, social and human rights">ESHR</abbr> impacts</h2>

<p>A review was undertaken in line with the requirements of the OECD Common Approaches and Equator Principles to identify potential <abbr title="environmental, social and human rights">ESHR</abbr> risks and impacts of the Project and how these would be effectively managed.</p>

<p>A review of project-related documentation by an Independent Environmental and Social Consultant (<abbr title="Independent Environmental and Social Advisor">IESC</abbr>), was also undertaken.</p>

<p>The review included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>site visit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>desk-based review of project-related documentation: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), including Resttlement Action Plans (RAPS) and a Resettlement Policy Framework, a Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), a Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) and Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA); and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow-up meetings and interviews with relevant Project representatives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an all-party workshop in Ankara.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The results of this review formed the basis for the evaluation of the Project’s alignment with relevant international standards, and recommendations for future compliance and monitoring.</p>

<p>Taking account of the review, the Project was deemed to have potential to cause a number of adverse environmental and social impacts both during construction and operation. However, a proposed suite of controls as part of the Project’s environmental and social management systems should facilitate the management of these impacts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Climate change considerations</h2>

<p>UKEF considered the potential direct and indirect green house gas (<abbr title="green house gas">GHG</abbr>) emissions of the Project and effects of climate change factors on the Project as part of its <abbr title="environmental, social and human rights">ESHR</abbr> review.</p>

<p>The design of the Project incorporates measures for enhancing efficiency, by their nature, electric trains are more resource efficient than conventional trains that use diesel, a fossil fuel.</p>

<p>A climate change risk assessment including consideration of physical risks and a quantification of Scope 1 and 2 emissions during construction and operation of the Project was undertaken. The assessment included identification of relevant climate change trends, their potential impacts and existing design and mitigation measures. Estimated emmissions are considered reasonable, whilst the Project will produce more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions per year, this will be limited to a three and a half year period of construction. Operation will see the Project shift to low-carbon public transport, which is anticipated to have a positive impact through avoided <abbr title="green house gas">GHG</abbr> emissions.</p>

<p>The physical risks of climate change relevant to the Project were identified and it was confirmed in the review that relevant adaptation measures are integrated into the Project design process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Decision</h2>

<p>Various actions have been agreed between the Project developer, operator, and parties involved in the financing, which are necessary to ensure the Project’s on-going alignment with international standards. Following agreement of these commitments, it was concluded that the Project should meet the relevant international standards over the Project cycle. UKEF has therefore decided to provide its support in respect of the supply of goods and services by UK exporters to the Project.</p>

<p>A condition of support is that Project will be subject to monitoring and reporting in order to provide satisfaction that the Project is aligned with the relevant international standards throughout the duration of support.</p>
