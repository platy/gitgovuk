<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, and is not a substitute for independent legal advice.  Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information.  The information contained in this guide is general and factual.  You should contact local lawyers for independent legal advice (further information below).</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in the Netherlands and who can help.  A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody.</p>

<p>We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h3>Contacting us</h3>
<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Consulate (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Consulate even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested.  This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<h4>The British Embassy in the Netherlands:</h4>

<p>Who are the Consular Representatives?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Imogen Barnes, Vice-Consul</li>
  <li>Angela Wills, Pro-Consul</li>
  <li>Paul Hughes, Pro-Consul</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact Information:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

British Consulate
<br>British Embassy The Hague
<br>Tel: 0031 70 4270 427 (Choose option 2 for Consular Services)
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.</p>

<h3>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help.  Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.  We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, when a British citizen is arrested and detained in the Netherlands, the Dutch authorities are not at liberty to divulge the arrest to a third party. They should make you aware of your right to contact the British Consulate and give you the opportunity to do so or notify us on your behalf. However, we often learn of an arrest informally from family, friends, or the prison social worker.</p>

<p>When we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>We can also:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>

    <p>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</p>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family.  In places where phone or postal services aren’t available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you – <a class="govuk-link" href="#Mail/Parcels">see Mail/Parcels section below</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<h3>Can you / will you tell my family?</h3>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have.  For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h3>Will the UK police be informed?</h3>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police.  It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>Do I need a lawyer? How can I find a lawyer?</h3>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/netherlands-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">list of local interpreters</a> and a list of local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/netherlands-list-of-lawyers">English-speaking lawyers</a>. You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h3>Can you get me out?</h3>
<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British.  However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities.  This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h3>Who else can help me?</h3>
<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families</a>.</p>

<h2>Detention conditions in the Netherlands</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h3>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h3>

<p>Important: In order to receive visitors, you must provide the prison with the names of those who you would like to be visited by. The prison requires the full name, date of birth, address and passport information of all possible visitors; normally you are permitted ten names on your list which you can supply to the guards within the first weeks of your arrival. If you fail to do this and the name of the visitor is not held by the prison authorities the visitor will be denied entry.</p>

<p>Procedures to arrange a visit vary depending on the prison; some prefer to work with allocated time slots for each detainee, whilst others require you to make an appointment beforehand. We strongly advise that any family member wishing to visit you firstly contact the prison. If your visitor is travelling from another country e.g. the UK, you should always advise the prison authorities of this fact and submit a request for an extended visit. The prison authorities are not obliged to permit a longer visit however; some facilities take this into consideration and allow extra time.</p>

<h3>What can visitors expect?</h3>

<p>All visitors will need to show ID upon arrival.  Visitors and their bags will pass through metal detectors and maybe subject to further searches.  The visit will take place in a communal hall and guards will be present.  The visit is usually an hour long unless arrangements have been made for an extended visit.</p>

<h3>What can visitors bring?</h3>

<p>Visitors are not allowed to hand anything over to you during the visit. There are set times and days when family or friends may drop off clothes and other pre-agreed items at the prison. Please ask your prison for further details.</p>

<h3>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>In the Netherlands detained British citizens are visited once during the detention period. If you feel you need further visits, please submit a request to the Consulate, either in writing or by contacting us via the telephone, outlining the reason why.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern at the address below:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

British Embassy 
<br>Lange Voorhout 10 
<br>2514 ED 
<br>The Hague, Netherlands 
<br>Tel: 0031 70 4270 427 (Choose option 2 for Consular Services)
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>Emergency trips outside of prison</h3>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, for example attending the funeral of a close family member, it may be possible.  You must speak with your prison authority for more information.</p>

<h2>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h2>

<h3>Arrival at the police station and basic rights</h3>

<p>If you have been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence and brought to a police station. The police can hold you up to 6 “working hours”.  The hours between midnight and 09:00 am do not count towards this period.</p>

<p>The Police may wish to investigate further and therefore can lodge a request with the assistant prosecutor to extend the custody period. You shall be interviewed by the prosecutor (who is normally a senior police officer) and if the warrant is granted you can be held without charge for a further 72 hours.</p>

<p>You will be allowed a telephone call to a family member or friend advising of your whereabouts, providing that there are no legal restrictions in place. At this point you should also be given the opportunity to advise the Consulate of your detention.</p>

<p>You will also have access to an English speaking lawyer should you so wish.</p>

<p>Within three days and fifteen hours from the time of your arrest you must be brought before an examining judge (officer of justice) who shall determine whether you will be placed in remand or released.</p>

<h3>Appearance at court</h3>

<p>Applications for bail are unlikely to be accepted in the case of a person who faces serious charges or who is not a normal resident of the Netherlands, although it is not unheard of.</p>

<p>If you have been remanded in custody awaiting trial, you will be automatically assigned a court appointed lawyer. However, you are entitled to hire another lawyer if you wish. Even if you have admitted to the offence or intend to plead guilty at court, it is still worthwhile seeking professional advice since a lawyer will know exactly how everything works and what options are available to you. A court translator will be present in the courtroom.</p>

<p>See more information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="#the-dutch-judicial-system">Dutch judicial system</a>.</p>

<h3>Initial arrival at the prison</h3>

<p>On arrival you will receive a medical examination, any pre-existing health conditions and treatments can be discussed with the medical team and prescriptions arranged. If necessary a Dutch health professional can make contact with the UK health professionals. You will be given a tour of the section of the prison where you will be staying and procedures regarding visitors, making calls, arranging clothes etc. explained.  Within two weeks you should receive an appointment with the social worker to discuss any help you might need, for example if you need extra clothes.</p>

<h2>Prison: conditions and daily life</h2>

<p>Prisons and other Penitentiary establishments in the Netherlands are of a comparatively high standard.  They are staffed to a high professional level and as you are protected by legislation, you should receive humane and fair treatment.  The first few weeks are the most stressful, it takes time to become familiar with your new environment and understand the procedures involving visitation rights, prison comforts (transfer of money), making calls and arranging clothes or personal items. Once this has transpired both the detainee and the family are generally more at ease.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>The Netherlands has different types of prisons. Persons being held in pre-trial detention are placed in a remand centre. Those who have been convicted by a court are detained in a prison. Prisons vary in accommodation with a mix of shared (bunk style) and individual cells (single). They are often well equipped with a desk, TV and washing/toilet facilities.</p>

<h3>Food and diet</h3>

<p>A balanced diet is offered, supplying the necessary daily nutritional requirements.  A special diet can only be provided on medical or religious grounds.  You can supplement your diet by buying food from the prison shop.</p>

<h3>Work and study</h3>

<p>Paid employment is often offered in Prison although it can take a few weeks before a job becomes available.
The opportunity to study is more of a challenge, this is normally reserved for Dutch residents and speakers as classes are given in Dutch.  However, it is not unheard of that a non-Dutch speaker is allowed to participate in classes.  Again this seems to differ depending on the prison.</p>

<h3>Contact and languages</h3>

<p>Contact with other prisoners will depend on why you are detained, if you are on restrictions you will not be allowed to speak with anyone other than your lawyer, once these restrictions are eased you will be able to mix with other prisoners.</p>

<p>It is possible a prisoner with be put in a cell with other English speaking inmates, but not guaranteed. Whilst not all the guards speak English, there are a lot that do.</p>

<p>Detainees have access to phones, they can purchase writing materials, but there is no free access to internet.</p>

<p>Prisons do have libraries and there is usually access to English books, but the amount varies from prison to prison.
Depending on length of sentence and if the prisoner is motivated can undertake training courses in prison. There is the possibility to request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Gym, exercise and other activities such as access to television varies with each prison.</p>

<h3>Religion</h3>

<p>In most prisons Christian Chaplains, Islam Imams and Humanist Spiritual advisors are available and can attend prison providing spiritual assistance where this is asked.</p>

<h3>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h3>

<p>A drug rehabilitation programme is available in the majority of prisons. If you have a drug related habit and would like assistance you can confide with the authorities.</p>

<p>The rules and regulations will be explained to you at your intake.</p>

<p>House rules apply in all prisons that detainees must adhere to, the director of the prison may impose a penalty on a prisoner that misbehaves. Disciplinary punishments are, for example: placement in a punishment cell, denial of visitors or exclusion from participation in certain activities.</p>

<p>There is a reward system for good behaviours which could mean you can participate in the evening programme 2 nights per week.</p>

<p>Drugs are not allowed within prisons, everyone who enters a prison undergoes a strict check on entry. Baggage also goes through an X-ray machine and, if necessary, is checked again by hand.</p>

<p>Persons suspected of being in possession of drugs are searched. Clothing and body get an extensive check.</p>

<p>Every offender undergoes a regular urine test in the presence of a staff member, and the sample is examined in a laboratory. If strange or addictive substances are present in the urine, there will be additional punishment or a measure, such as placement in seclusion, denial of visit or withdrawal of leave.</p>

<p>Cell inspections are done regularly the staff thoroughly inspects all cells and areas where offenders usually go.</p>

<p>Visitor areas: the visiting areas of closed institutions are arranged in such a way that there is good supervision of the offender and the visit.</p>

<p>After possible physical contact, a body search follows; Dogs, trained to detect drugs, are used to receive visitors and to check cells, other areas and incoming items.</p>

<h2>Prison: access to help and services</h2>

<h3>How can I receive money?</h3>

<p>There are two ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<p>Private funds: Family or friends can transfer money to the prison for you. This information is normally on the prison web-site (only in Dutch) however, you can request this information in writing or direct your family to call the administration office at the prison.</p>

<p>Important: if the transfer is being made from abroad, please ensure that that the family are made aware that they will require the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IBAN bank account number</li>
  <li>BIC number of the prison bank account</li>
  <li>your prison number</li>
  <li>make note in transfer of your initials and surname</li>

<p>Prisoners Abroad: Depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).</p>

<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>

<h3>Private funds</h3>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to arrange this.
We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h3>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#prisoners-abroad">Prisoners Abroad section</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h3>

<p>While you are in detention, the Netherlands is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.
Both medical and dental treatment is available. If you need medical or dental treatment you should make an appointment to see the prison doctor or dentist. There can be long waiting times for the dentist, emergency cases take priority.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor.  We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h3>Mail/Parcels</h3>

<p>Our Consular staff will reply to your written correspondence within our target of 20 working days (excluding postage time). There is usually no limit to the number of letters you may send or receive. Parcels of clothing or other personal items must be pre-agreed with the prison.</p>

<h3>Can I make telephone calls?</h3>

<p>Yes, if there are no restrictions you can make calls. You shall be given a telephone card with a weekly allowance, unfortunately this is barely enough to cover international calls. Once settled and working you can use your earnings to buy call time or ask family to transfer money for prison comforts.</p>

<h3>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h3>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can send a letter of complaint to the complaints commission or place a call to them:</p>

<h2>The Dutch Judicial System</h2>

<h3>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h3>Is the system the same as the UK?</h3>

<p>The Netherlands has a civil law system which is based on set statutes decided by parliament and are applied to every case. This is in contrast to the UK, whereby a common law system is used drawing on past judicial cases and decisions.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h3>What should happen when I am arrested?</h3>

<p>The Police may wish to question you further at the Police station. They can hold you for up to “six working hours” – the hours between midnight and 09:00 am do not count towards this period</p>

<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack.</p>

<h3>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h3>

<p>The Police may wish to investigate further and therefore shall lodge a request with the assistant prosecutor to extend the custody period. You shall be interviewed by the prosecutor (who is normally a senior police officer) and if the warrant is granted you can be held without charge for a further 72 hours.</p>

<h3>What happens when I am charged?</h3>

<p>Within three days and fifteen hours from the time of your arrest you must be brought before an examining judge (officer of justice) who shall determine whether you will be placed in remand or released.</p>

<h3>What provision is there for bail?</h3>

<p>Applications for bail are unlikely to be accepted in the case of a person who faces serious charges or who is not a normal resident of the Netherlands, although it is not unheard of.</p>

<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>

<h2>Trial and legal assistance</h2>

<h3>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h3>

<p>If you have been remanded in custody awaiting trial, you will be automatically assigned a court appointed lawyer.</p>

<p>However, you are entitled to hire another lawyer if you wish. Even if you have admitted to the offence or intend to plead guilty at court, it is still worthwhile seeking professional advice since a lawyer will know exactly how everything works and what options are available to you.</p>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, a list of English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack. Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<h3>What happens at the trial?</h3>

<p>A trial is normally always open to the public, unless there are minors involved.</p>

<p>The Judge will start by checking your name and address. The public prosecutor shall start proceedings by explaining the punishable offence of which you are accused.</p>

<p>The Judge will then question you. The prosecutor and your lawyer (if present) may also ask questions. Witnesses and experts can be called to give evidence.</p>

<p>Personal circumstances will also be examined by the Judge. The prosecutor and the lawyer will give their version of the events and what they believe to be the best outcome.</p>

<p>If there is a victim involved the Judge may also give the victim the opportunity to speak. After all accounts have been heard, including the summary from both sides, that is when you will have the opportunity to make your comments to the Judge.</p>

<p>A court translator will be present in the courtroom.</p>

<h2>Sentences</h2>

<p>Normally in a less serious case the sentencing shall be immediate. Otherwise the court will re-convene in (usually) two weeks.</p>

<h3>How can appeals be made?</h3>

<p>If you disagree with the court’s ruling, you may be permitted to lodge an appeal. If so, you must do this within fourteen days of the verdict being returned. You can request your lawyer to lodge the appeal on your behalf. Here is a brief description of the appeal system in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The Netherlands is divided into 11 districts, each with its own court. Each district court is made up of a maximum of five sectors, which always includes the administrative law, civil law, criminal law and sub-district law sector.</p>

<p>Appeals against judgements passed by the district court of criminal law cases can be lodged at the competent Court of Appeal (there are four Courts of Appeal in total); appeals against administrative law judgements for criminal law cases are lodged at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>Courts of Appeal</h3>

<p>The Court of Appeal re-examines the facts of the case and reaches its own conclusions. In most cases it is possible to contest the Court of Appeals decision by appealing in cassation to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h3>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h3>

<p>If your sentence is longer than one year you may be considered for early release after serving two thirds of your sentence.</p>

<h3>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h3>

<p>If you receive a sentence of one year or less, you must serve the full sentence. If you received an unconditional sentence for more than one year then you may be eligible for parole. Please make enquiries with your lawyer.</p>

<h3>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h3>

<p>This is a rare occurrence and would need to be explored with legal assistance.</p>

<h3>What about any financial penalties?</h3>

<p>These can occur and must be paid on time otherwise you run the risk of being detained. If you do not live in the Netherlands and wish to appeal the fine, you can contact, in writing the arrondissement (court where case was held).</p>

<h3>Is transfer to another prison within the Netherlands possible?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can submit a transfer request to the prison authorities for their consideration outlining the reason why.</p>

<h3>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can submit a transfer request.</p>

<p>To transfer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)
not be awaiting trial</li>
  <li>have exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal</li>
  <li>have at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer</li>
  <li>have no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties</li>
</ul>

<p>The offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The authorities in the sentencing country may refuse your request. You should be aware that even if the sentencing State agrees to your transfer then the UK authorities may also refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family residents there.</p>

<h3>Who to submit a request to in The Netherlands</h3>

<p>The International Transfer of Criminal Judgments department (Internationale Overdracht Strafvonnissen or IOS) deal with transfers.</p>

<p>To contact IOS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call the WETS WOTS Information Line: 08807 25 963 Open from Monday to Friday from 9.00 am to 12.00 pm</li>
  <li>lawyers and family members who have questions about a transfer of sentences can also call 08807 25 963, or send a letter to:</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h3>

<p>Expulsion from the Netherlands can be ordered by the court. If this is the case and you are deemed as an unwanted alien, your release details will be forwarded to the Dutch Repatriation and Immigration services. Roundabout your release date, (normally within a couple of weeks of your official release date) you will be taken from the prison under police escort and deported back to the UK.</p>

<p>If there is no expulsion order you are free to make your own forward journey or if previously residing in the Netherlands return home.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<p>Other sources of practical help back in the UK are The Salvation Army – UK Helpline +44 (0)20 7367 4888, Monday to Friday 8 AM to 4 PM, or contact your local Salvation Army branch – and The Prison Fellowship, UK Helpline +44 (0)20 7799 2500, Monday to Friday 9 AM to 5 PM.</p>

<h3>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h3>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>
