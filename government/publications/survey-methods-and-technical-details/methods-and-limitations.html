<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Survey Methodological Note</h2>

<p>The People and Nature Survey for England gathers evidence and trend data through an online survey relating to people’s enjoyment, access, understanding of and attitudes to the natural environment, and its contributions to wellbeing.</p>

<p>People and Nature is an online panel survey (self-completion questionnaire), sampling up to 25,000 adults in England on a continuous basis over 2020/2021. The survey launched in April 2020 and builds on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitor-of-engagement-with-the-natural-environment-survey-purpose-and-results">Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey</a> that ran from 2009 to 2019.</p>

<p>The People and Nature Survey consists of different modules. All modules are asked throughout the entire year, but certain modules (those that do not require an overall sample size of 25,000) are only asked to a randomly selected sub-sample of individuals. This means that some questions will have responses from everyone asked and some will have a smaller sample size.</p>

<p>Data is released quarterly and started in September 2020. Additionally, in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we have produced monthly indicators of some indicative metrics using data from a subset of the survey questions. These early releases (from April 2020) have enabled us, in a timely manner, to better understand the impacts and implications of COVID-19 on people’s engagement with nature, health and wellbeing, and have informed the Government’s and others’ plans for recovery.</p>

<p>Data from the People and Nature Survey was initially released as ‘Experimental Statistics’, a form of Official Statistics that are in the testing phase. However, after one year of data collection, we have developed a collaborative analysis framework, refined our data quality assurance processes and finalised an optimal specific weighting scheme approach. Products from the People and Nature Survey are now therefore of sufficient statistical quality to merit ongoing production as Official Statistics. Publications are labelled according to their release status.</p>

<p>Experimental and Official Statistic statuses allow for the noteworthy change in data collection methodology between MENE and the People and Nature Survey to be fully evaluated before a planned transition to National Statistics designation. For more information on Official Statistics please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">Office of National Statistics</a> website.</p>

<p>In 2020, the People and Nature Survey underwent a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rapid_review_letter_Natural_England_People_and_Nature_Survey_indicators.pdf" rel="external">rapid regulatory review</a> with the Office for Statistical Regulation to ensure compliance with the Code of Practice for Statistics, and its principles of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trustworthiness: is about having confidence in the people and organisations that produce statistics and data.</li>
  <li>Quality: is about using data and methods that produce assured statistics.</li>
  <li>Value: is about producing statistics that support society’s needs for information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Monthly Indicator Releases</h3>

<p>Monthly indicator releases designated as Experimental Statistics have been published for the first year of the People and Nature Survey (April 2020 – March 2021).</p>

<p>For the first year of the survey, indicators were generated using an interim weighting method. The interim weights were originally developed for the MENE survey and enabled Natural England to report timely data on people’s engagement with nature during COVID-19 while specific People and Nature Survey weights were in development.</p>

<p>For the second year of the survey onwards (April 2021), indicators have been published using specific People and Nature Survey weights as Official Statistics.</p>

<p>These publications report a set of weighted national indicators from the survey, which have been generated using data collected from April 1st 2020. Results generated using the interim weights are titled <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england#monthly-interim-indicators-year-1-(april-2020-%E2%80%93-march-2021)">‘Monthly Interim Indicators’</a>, whereas results generated using the specific People and Nature weights are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england#monthly-indicators-year-2-(april-2021-%E2%80%93-march-2022)">‘Monthly Indicators’</a>. Additionally, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-monthly-indicators-with-specific-weight-for-april-2020-march-2021-official-statistics">monthly indicators</a> for the first year have been updated with the specific People and Nature Survey weights to allow comparisons between the first year and subsequent years.</p>

<p>National indicators include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gross number of visits taken by adults (by age, income, ethnicity, and sex)</li>
  <li>% adults spending time outside in last 12 months by frequency</li>
  <li>% children spending time outside in last 12 months by frequency</li>
  <li>% adults visiting outside in last 14 days</li>
  <li>% adults visiting outside in last 7 days</li>
  <li>% adults visiting outside by place type (e.g. parks) in last month</li>
  <li>% adults agree that natural spaces are ‘Good places for mental health and wellbeing’</li>
  <li>% adults agree natural spaces are ‘Places that encourage physical health and exercise’</li>
  <li>% adults agree having access to a private or shared garden, outdoor space or allotment is important</li>
  <li>% adults agree ‘I feel part of nature’</li>
  <li>% adults agree ‘Being in nature makes me very happy’</li>
  <li>% adults agree that they are taking more time to notice and engage with every day nature</li>
  <li>% adults engagement with nature since coronavirus restrictions began</li>
  <li>% adults behaviour and attitude changes in relation to green and natural spaces since coronavirus restrictions began</li>
  <li>% adults increasing amount of time on certain activities since coronavirus restrictions began</li>
  <li>% adults reducing the amount of; time they travel by car, food their household throws away or meat they eat since coronavirus restrictions began</li>
  <li>% adults prevented from spending time outdoors since coronavirus restrictions began due to certain barriers</li>
  <li>% children spending time outside and engaging with nature since coronavirus restrictions began, as reported by adults</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Sampling</h3>

<p>A sample of households was selected from the England subset of Kantar’s Lightspeed Panel. Samples are representative of the target population (adults aged 16 or older living in England) and quotas for age, gender, region, education and ethnicity are in place to ensure key population groups are adequately represented.</p>

<p>Sample sizes are included in all releases for each question, and in the supporting data. It should be noted that all respondents were not asked all questions, and this has been flagged where applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Weighting</h3>

<p>The interim weights are representative of the English adult population, according to the latest population estimate data available from the Office for National Statistics and based on the weighting developed for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/875153/MENE_Technical_Report_Years_1_to_10v2.pdf" rel="external">MENE survey data</a>. This approach was deemed appropriate given the large similarities between MENE and the People and Nature Survey, and the significant amount of MENE data which supports the selection of key variables used to develop the MENE weights. These weights were applied to statistical releases upto December 2021.</p>

<p>Specific weights for the People and Nature Survey for England have now been developed and applied to statistical releases from January 2021 onwards. These specific weights have been generated using regression modelling, which was able to highlight a large number of demographic variables significantly associated with number of visits to green and natural spaces.</p>

<p>We have included the following significant demographic variables in the People and Nature Survey weight (Urban / Rural, Region, Age by Gender, Working Status by Gender, Long lasting health condition, Number cars/vans, Education, Ethnicity, Dog ownership, Presence of children under 16) and ensured the weighted People and Survey data is representative of the population in terms of these variables. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/951509/The_People_and_Nature_Survey_For_England_-_Technical_Report.pdf" rel="external">Technical Report</a> for more information on how this weight has been generated.</p>

<p>There are small differences in figures generated by the interim and bespoke People and Nature Survey weight. Therefore, direct comparisons between monthly statistics from the People and Nature Survey that have been generated using the different weights is not advised. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-monthly-indicators-with-specific-weight-for-april-2020-march-2021-official-statistics">Previous results</a> have been updated with the specific People and Nature weight, and these should be used for comparisons.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Strengths &amp; Limitations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Experimental statistics collected via an online panel</h3>

<p>The People and Nature Survey is conducted by Kantar using its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kantar.com/expertise/research-services/panels-and-audiences/kantar-profiles-network" rel="external">online Lightspeed panel</a>. The online panel brings benefits in terms of speed, ability to interview during lockdown and reducing social desirability bias. However, it is important to flag limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since panals are opt-in there is the risk that panelists are not representative of the general population.</li>
  <li>Online panel surveys exclude the off-line population.</li>
</ul>

<p>To minimise the risk of bias, Lightspeed uses a variety of recruitment methods. This includes opt-in email, e-newsletter campaigns, and social media.</p>

<p>Sample composition analysis during development of these statistics compared online panel methods and MENE. It showed that the online samples tend to be more representative than MENE in terms of age and working status. However, online samples tend not to represent the very oldest in the population well (as they are the least likely to have internet access). Both the online panel and MENE tend to achieve samples that are broadly representative of the population by region. Online samples tend to under-represent people from ethnic minority backgrounds, which is why an additional quota criteria for ethnicity was set for the People and Nature Survey.</p>

<p>The survey was developed specifically to ensure it worked well on mobile devices. Quota objectives to achieve a nationally representative sample in terms of age, gender, region, ethnicity, and education level have been achieved (at least 95% of the target). Work is continuing to understand strengths and limitations of the panel method and further information will be published in due course. Details on how data is collected, analysed and reported on for specific sub-groups within the population are provided below:</p>

<h4>Ethnicity and race</h4>

<p>For the People and Nature survey, we have collected data on ethnicity and race in line with the 2011 Census<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) runs the Census of England and Wales every 10 years. The decision on which ethnic and race groups to include is made in consultation with users of Census data (like government departments, local authorities, and the National Health Service) as well as people completing the Census, and the interest groups that represent them.</p>

<p>It is recognised that ethnic and race groups included in the Census do not represent how all people identify. Like the Census, the People and Nature Survey offers an option for people to write in their ethnic group, race or background using their own words if they do not identify with any groups in the list.</p>

<p>Following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/style-guide/writing-about-ethnicity" rel="external">government guidance</a> we use the term ‘ethnic minorities’ rather than Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) or Black and minority ethnic (BME).</p>

<p>While we consider all ethnic minorities in our analysis, we may not be able to report findings for individual groups owing to sample size constraints. In this instance, we will do our best to highlight where differences between ethnic minority groups and the White British group are occurring in relation to engagement with, and enjoyment of, the natural environment.</p>

<p>As our sample size grows, we will increasingly be able to analyse data and report findings that are specific to individual ethnic minority groups. Ultimately, we hope with this analysis to be able to reflect socio-cultural influences as well as other drivers of behaviour (including structural barriers, such as experience of discrimination) which may differ from the White British group.</p>

<h4>Disability</h4>

<p>For releases pre-September 2020 we are able to report data in consideration of whether the respondent has long term (12 months+) physical or mental health conditions or illness. From September 2020 we introduced a second element to this question which asks about whether this reduces the respondent’s ability to carry out day-to-day activities. This addition will ensure that we are able to report based on the Office for National Statistic’s definition of disability. We recognise that this bio-medical definition of disability, which focuses primarily on limitations of the individual body has limitations. Alternative understandings, including those reflecting the role of physical and social environments in creating experiences of disability (e.g. how settings are designed and managed, and how people with impairments are treated by others when in green and blue spaces), are important. The survey team is considering how complementary research could reflect these broader understandings of disability.</p>

<h4>Gender</h4>

<p>Quotas have been set to compensate for known biases in online panels. Younger people and men are generally under-represented on panels (as they tend to be across all survey methods), so the quota by age and sex is interlocked. It is important to note that the population targets used only include male and female categories. As there are not yet robust population targets that allow for more than male/female categories, in order to manage survey fieldwork (and monitor quotas) anyone that selects a non-binary response is randomly assigned to either male or female in the quota targets and in the weighting. This includes the quota /fieldwork tables in reports. However, for analysis purposes the full response list is included in the dataset and any combining of response categories should be clearly stated in any reporting.</p>

<p>Between April and September the survey asked respondents about their sex, in October we will update the wording to ask about gender identity. The current survey response options are: ‘male’, ‘female’ or ‘in another way’. We are currently exploring whether a change of wording and additional response options will improve the inclusivity of the survey. For releases pre-September, those respondents who responded ‘in another way’ make up a very small proportion of the respondents (count = 4). The overall figures are reported in accompanying data files.</p>

<h4>Poverty</h4>

<p>The People and Nature survey asks respondents to indicate which of a range of income brackets best describes their total annual household income before tax. Based on guidance from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) we have calculated relative poverty (‘relative low income’ as households which have less than 60% of contemporary median income before housing costs) as £14,803 for this financial year. The lowest income bracket reported on for the People and Nature Survey is £0-14,999 and this is a good approximation of income below the relative poverty line. Therefore, we have chosen to report some findings by referring to those who live below the poverty line compared to those who live above it or in another income bracket.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Comparing indicators with other data</h3>

<p>Where appropriate, indicators have been compared against other data sources and we report where similar or contrasting trends have been identified.</p>

<p>Although similar types of data are reported, direct comparisons of the People and Nature Survey and MENE findings should not be made. The People and Nature Survey has similar aims and many similar questions to MENE and, like the external survey data included in these monthly reports, it provides useful context. However, it is important to note significant differences in methods could have an impact on results. The People and Nature Survey uses an online panel approach whereas MENE used face-to-face interviews; there are differences in how respondents answer questions between these two different survey methods. Furthermore, for many questions, there have been other changes including question recall period and question length, plus new questions have been added to the People and Nature Survey.</p>

<p>Natural England are exploring an approach to calibrate a small number of key metrics from the People and Nature Survey and MENE. This approach aims to harmonise these metrics before and after the change in survey approach.</p>

<p>We have decided the best approach for calibration is ‘backward’ harmonisation. This will mean some historical MENE metrics will change (i.e. a new calibration factor will be applied to some metrics calculated from historical MENE data to allow for a degree of continuity between MENE and the new People and Nature Survey).</p>

<p>To harmonise any metrics between the People and Nature Survey and MENE, a parallel run will take place where online and face-to-face interview approaches are conducted at the same time. Due to current COVID-19 restrictions, the feasibility of harmonising certain metrics between the People and Nature Survey and MENE will be unknown until face-to-face interviews can be safely conducted over enough time (ca. 1 year). Therefore, any use of MENE data for context should be used with caution and understanding of the limitations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Socio-demographic characteristics</h3>

<p>Results from MENE indicated that there was inequality of environmental engagement between population sub-groups defined by a number of demographic characteristics (including: age, ethnicity, and socio-economic background, region, urban-rural and health).</p>

<p>The People and Nature survey has been designed to report findings by socio-demographic characteristics. Reporting on a quarterly basis ensures larger sample sizes are reported against each question, thereby reducing standard errors.</p>
