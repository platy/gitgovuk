<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>Sexual assault of any type can be a very traumatic experience wherever it happens, but it can be even more difficult to deal with when it happens abroad.</p>

<p>It is your choice what you do next but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact your tour operator, if you are travelling with one, to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator, we will try and send a staff member to support you where timing and location allow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-phnom-penh">British Embassy in Phnom Penh</a> on 061 300 011 or 012. Embassy staff will be empathetic and non-judgemental and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Cambodia</h2>

<p>If you want to report the incident to the police, Criminal Investigation Police are based at Provincial Headquarters. You should call the police or go to the nearest police station as soon as possible. Note that Cambodian police officers may have limited English language skills.</p>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If possible the British Embassy will try to send a staff member to support you depending on location and timing. However, you will always be able to speak to a trained officer on the telephone 24/7.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the British Embassy on 061 300 011 or 061 300 012 and they can offer you consular support.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, texts or social media messages.</p>

<p>In Cambodia the police speak very little English, so it is best to bring a translator with you if you feel able to, be it a friend or a tour guide if you have one. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">list of local translators and interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report. Cambodian police reports are only ever produced in Khmer. You may also, therefore, wish to obtain a translation into English, however this is very unlikely to be provided by the Cambodian police. Once you have a translation, the police may be prepared to stamp the English version to authenticate it.</p>

<p>Note that in order to file a complaint, you may need to pay the police officer a fee.</p>

<h3>Does the victim run any risk of reporting a rape or sexual assault (RSA) to the local police?</h3>

<p>Neither extramarital sex nor homosexuality are crimes in Cambodia. However, police are not specifically trained to deal with victims of RSA and are unlikely to handle the matter sympathetically.</p>

<h3>Will there be both male and female police officers to talk to? Will there be English-speaking officers available? Will the victim have to wait for an interpreter?</h3>

<p>We can ask that a male or female police officer interviews you if that is what you want. However, we cannot guarantee this request will be met. We also cannot guarantee that an English-speaking police officer will be available or that an interpreter will be provided by the police. If a Khmer-speaking Embassy staff member is able to accompany you to the police station, they can provide unofficial translation.</p>

<h3>What evidence will the victim be asked to give?</h3>

<p>Should you decide to make a police report, you should call the police or go to the nearest police station as soon as possible.  Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.  If you wish to change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police.  You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, texts or social media messages.</p>

<p>Currently there are no places in Cambodia that can effectively or reliably manage the collection of, and the chain of evidence for, a medical examination.  However, you may wish to have a full medical examination that creates some evidence and depending on timing and location, if you wish us to, we will accompany you there.  The examination can involve a pelvic exam, vaginal/penile/anal swabs, fingernail scrapings and blood samples.  These samples may be used as forensic evidence if a case moves forward.  If the police have a suspect, they may also instruct them to be examined.  You may also choose just to have a medical examination solely for the purpose of your health and not to collect evidence.  The choice is entirely yours.</p>

<p>The police may also take pictures of places of your body where there is evidence of violence such as bruises or cuts, and they may ask for some of your clothing.  Do not be surprised if the police officer uses their personal phone to take pictures.  If they do, you may wish to think about how this makes you feel and whether you are willing to have these images stored on an individual’s phone.  You have the right to say no to this. (You should be aware that there is a risk the police may publish these photos on their Facebook page (without your consent) in order to publicise their work to the general public. Sometimes they will ‘blur’ your face in the picture, sometimes they will not. As a foreigner, you may be unaware that your image has been shared publicly. You can either refuse to have the photographs taken or make it clear to the officer that you do not want them shared, although we cannot guarantee that they will not do so anyway).</p>

<h3>What help will consular staff be able to give the victim while they are at the police station?</h3>

<p>If a Khmer-speaking Embassy staff member is able to accompany you to the police station, they can provide unofficial translation.</p>

<h3>Will the victim have to surrender their passport while any investigation is carried out?</h3>

<p>No, the victim will not be required to surrender their passport. The police will ask for your passport in order to complete their report or other relevant documents, but they will not confiscate it.  They are not entitled to do so.  Passports are only confiscated from foreigners when they have committed a crime, to prevent them fleeing the country.</p>

<h3>Will a lawyer be assigned to the victim or should they instruct their own lawyer?</h3>

<p>It is not compulsory for the victim to have a lawyer, so they will not be assigned one by the State. However, a lawyer can help to draft the complaint for the court. They can also access and review the case and see the statement(s) from the suspect. If a victim files a complaint and then leaves the country, the only way to obtain updates on the progress of the case would be to engage a lawyer to do this on their behalf. The lawyer will also play a key role if you decide to pursue civil compensation.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police</h2>

<p>The British Embassy will still be able to help you. This includes helping you contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.  We can provide you with lists of English speaking medical facilities in some areas (See Annex A), as well as lawyers and translators.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you do not report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence.</p>

<h3>Do you have to report the crime in-country for it to be investigated?</h3>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to the UK police however the possibility of an investigation being conducted once the victim has left Cambodia is greatly reduced.</p>

<h3>Will the victim be entitled to a forensic examination if they do not report the crime?</h3>

<p>No. You will need to fund your own medical examination.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is still possible to report a crime when you get back to the UK. However, the support available to you and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you are staying in Cambodia, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest British Embassy or the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London.</p>

<p>If you decide not to report the crime in Cambodia and instead report it to the UK police, they should send the information you provide to the Cambodian police. However, it is for the Cambodian authorities to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may choose not to take action. UK police forces cannot investigate a crime committed overseas. Cambodian police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally.</p>

<p>Even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad you can report the crime to the UK police who can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to the police in Cambodia as this might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Cambodia: what happens next?</h2>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report. You may also wish to request a translation into English, however this is unlikely to be provided by the Cambodian police.</p>

<h3>Will the victim have to make a statement about the incident including a description of the attacker(s)?</h3>

<p>Yes, in order to enable the police to have any chance of success, the victim will need to provide a statement giving as much information/evidence as possible, including a description of their attacker. This statement will be used as evidence at trial. A victim has the right to refuse to give a statement but it is unlikely a charge would be laid without this.</p>

<h3>Will the police keep any clothes or electronic equipment that may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner?</h3>

<p>Yes, it is possible the police will retain the clothing the victim was wearing at the time of the attack to be used as evidence in court. They may want to make records of texts or social media messages. It is unlikely but not impossible that they will want to keep your phone.</p>

<h3>Will the police send the victim (or take them) to the local hospital for a forensic examination? Are these hospitals easily accessible or are they only in major cities?</h3>

<p>By law, a police officer(s) should accompany the victim to the hospital to ensure the evidence is taken accurately and reliably.  However, in reality it is rare for the police to go with the victim.  The police will usually accept any documentation or information provided by the hospital without question.</p>

<p>However, the victim can request police to accompany them for their own security.</p>

<p>Most provincial hospitals are unlikely to have the capacity to conduct any type of RSA examination and any examination they do conduct you will be expected to pay for. There are facilities in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Battambang, Kampot and Kep that will conduct examinations, however not all of these clinics will offer post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). If you are outside of these areas, you will need to travel to one of these areas and attend a private clinic, at your own expense, in order to obtain a proper medical examination and PEP. Depending on timing and location, we can try to accompany you if you wish us to.</p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<h3>Do all hospitals and medical centres treat victims of RSA?</h3>

<p>No. Hospitals in Cambodia routinely turn away patients they cannot or will not treat. We would recommend you attend a private clinic (at your own expense) in order to be properly examined.</p>

<h3>Do hospitals automatically report the results of any examination to the police?</h3>

<p>Only if the police or the prosecutor request them to.</p>

<h3>Who carries out an examination? What does this entail? What will they check and how?</h3>

<p>The examination should be conducted by a doctor.  S/he may be assisted by a nurse. Private clinics may have Rape Kits but State run hospitals are unlikely to have the proper kit. The examination can involve a pelvic exam, vaginal/penile/anal swabs and blood samples.</p>

<h3>Will they take photographs?</h3>

<p>No, they should not need to.  They should provide a written report only.</p>

<h3>Will a female member of staff be present?</h3>

<p>Possibly, but this cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<h4>Can hospital medical staff give advice on HIV PEP medication? What is the availability of PEP locally? Is it medically prescribed or closely monitored?</h4>

<p>Your safety and health are paramount.  Even if you decide not to report what has happened to the police, we would encourage you to see a medical professional.  They can determine if you have been injured in any way and give you advice about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.</p>

<p>It is possible that you will have been exposed to the HIV virus, so you should also ask a doctor about Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP).  It means taking Antiretroviral Medicines (ART) after potentially being exposed to HIV to prevent becoming infected. HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>It is unlikely doctors in State-run hospitals will be familiar with PEP or be able to supply it. However, PEP may be available at private clinics in Cambodia and we can signpost you to your nearest clinic.  You may need to phone ahead to the clinics to check they have PEP in stock.</p>

<p>The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>

<p>See Annex A for a list of hospitals and clinics in Cambodia.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. Where can victims get emergency contraception? Is it free? Is a prescription or medical referral needed?</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the incident for it to be effective.  No prescription or medical referral is required and you can buy medication over the counter in most pharmacies.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you can let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h4>How is hospital treatment and tests paid for?</h4>

<p>Hospital treatment is not free for foreigners in Cambodia. You will be expected to pay for any treatment or tests you receive. You should speak to your insurance company about this. If you have no funds available we can liaise with family or friends in the UK to ask that they assist you financially.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in Cambodia: what to expect</h2>

<h3>Can/will the police take the victim to the scene of the crime, or where the victim thinks the attacker is located, to try to identify and arrest the person?</h3>

<p>If the victim consents and the police consider it is worthwhile then the victim may be taken to the location.  However, if the victim is not comfortable doing this they can refuse and identify the location another way. Embassy staff may be able to accompany you depending on timing and location.</p>

<h3>If a suspect is brought to the police station will the victim be asked to make an identification?</h3>

<p>Yes, if the victim is not comfortable being in the same room as their attacker they can identify the suspect by photograph.  The victim is under no obligation to make an identification but it will obviously help the police investigating the crime if they do so.</p>

<h3>If the police make an arrest, will they take the suspect before the public prosecutor? How quickly? What happens after that?</h3>

<p>If the police arrest a suspect they have 48 hours to submit their case to the public prosecutor.  The police may request an extension of custody for another 24 hours, with written authorisation from the public prosecutor.  After the expiry of the police custody, the suspect must be handed over to the public prosecutor immediately or released.</p>

<h3>Will the victim be expected to go in front of the public prosecutor to make a statement? Can lawyers do this? Do lawyers have access to the victim/case notes at this stage?</h3>

<p>Yes.  After the file is transferred to the public prosecutor, s/he may invite parties for a further interview and take another statement.  At this stage, if the prosecutor accepts the complaint, the case is referred to the investigating judge who will conduct further investigation and interviews.  However, if the victim has already left the country they can file a written statement via a lawyer.</p>

<h3>Will the victim be allowed to leave the country once the case is filed?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h2>Hiring a lawyer</h2>

<h3>What role can a privately hired lawyer perform?</h3>

<p>By hiring a lawyer, the victim will have legal representation working for their own interests who can keep them informed as the case progresses. Without a lawyer the victim will only be able to stay updated on the progress of the case if they understand court proceedings and know Khmer.  Embassy staff cannot monitor the trial or provide updates to the victim.</p>

<h3>Are there lawyers who specialise in rape and sexual assault cases?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3>Do lawyers offer an initial pro-bono service?</h3>

<p>Not usually. Most clients are expected to pay a large retainer upfront.</p>

<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-lawyers--2">list of English-speaking lawyers</a>.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<h3>If a suspect is ordered to trial will the victim be expected to testify in court? At which stage?</h3>

<p>The court will usually expect the victim to be present in court during the trial. The presiding judge may call on the victim to provide an oral statement, if deemed useful, during the trial stage or court hearing.  However, the victim can request the presiding judge, through his or her lawyer, for permission to submit a written statement instead. This will be submitted through their lawyer if they cannot be present in court.  Alternatively, the victim can request to give evidence via video conferencing – however, the court’s capacity to honour this request will be limited and a victim should not rely on being able to do this.</p>

<p>The victim can request the judge, through their lawyer, to conduct a closed hearing.</p>

<h3>Will the victim be able to testify from the UK or will they be expected to return to the country?</h3>

<p>The victim can request to give evidence via video conferencing – however, the court’s capacity to honour this request will be limited and a victim should not rely on being able to do this.</p>

<h3>Without a lawyer is the victim entitled to be kept aware of the case? What other benefits does hiring a lawyer bring?</h3>

<p>Yes, but they will only be able to do so if they understand court proceedings and know Khmer.  Embassy staff cannot monitor the trial or provide updates to the victim.</p>

<p>By hiring a lawyer, the victim will have legal representation working for their own interests who can keep them informed as the case progresses.</p>

<h3>If the case is referred for further investigation will the victim have to give an additional statement?</h3>

<p>The presiding judge may ask the victim to give an additional statement if the judge deems it necessary and helpful to the case.</p>

<h3>Is it possible to drop charges once they are filed if the victim wishes to? And if so are there any legal repercussions? Can the victim face charges for this? Is the charge of rape an automatic state prosecution that will not be dropped?</h3>

<p>Even if the victim withdraws from the proceedings the case will be taken through to its conclusion – whether the suspect is found innocent, guilty or the case is dropped due to lack of evidence. (The charge of rape must be prosecuted within 15 years. There is a Statute of Limitation of 15 years for a felony.)</p>

<p>Once the victim withdraws the complaint, they lose the chance to claim for compensation.</p>

<p>There are no legal repercussions for withdrawing from a case but there is the possibility that the judge will anyway invite the victim to give evidence as a witness.</p>

<h3>Can the alleged assailant press counter charges claiming false accusations?</h3>

<p>Yes, but the same process applies – the prosecutor must decide if there is sufficient evidence to go forward.</p>

<h3>Can the courts order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, either after they have been convicted in a criminal court or as a result of civil action?</h3>

<p>Yes, the court will decide on the compensation to the victim, to be paid by the perpetrator.  Sometimes the prosecutor will claim for compensation on behalf of the victim and at other times the victim must claim for themselves, through their lawyer.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<h3>Who will communicate with the victim? At what stages?</h3>

<p>The lawyer will communicate directly with the victim. They should agree between them when and how frequently the victim will be updated.</p>

<h3>What are the procedures if the victim is not resident in-country? Will the victim have to give a local address? Can this be the lawyer’s?</h3>

<p>The victim can request to give evidence via video conferencing – however, the court’s capacity to honour this request will be limited and a victim should not rely on being able to do this.</p>

<p>They should not need a local address but if they do, they should discuss this directly with their lawyer.</p>

<h3>If the victim does not want to appoint a lawyer, how can they be kept updated?</h3>

<p>They will only be able to stay updated if they understand court proceedings and know Khmer. Embassy staff cannot monitor the trial or provide updates to the victim.</p>

<h2>Legal Aid</h2>

<p>There is no legal aid available to foreigners in Cambodia.</p>

<h2>Sentencing</h2>

<h3>Are sentences weighted in favour of punishment or rehabilitation?</h3>

<p>Sentences are weighted in favour of punishment if the accused is convicted for previous offences or subsequent offences.  For instance, Article 87 states that if the accused commits a felony (which includes rape and sexual assault) within five years of being sentenced for a misdemeanour, the punishment for the accused will be aggravated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if the maximum sentence of imprisonment incurred for the felony does not exceed twenty years, the maximum sentence of imprisonment shall be doubled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the maximum sentence of imprisonment incurred for the felony is thirty years, the maximum sentence of imprisonment shall be life imprisonment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where there is no previous conviction, sentences are weighted in favour of rehabilitation. A judge may take into consideration mitigating circumstances and issue a reduced sentence.  For example, in the case of a felony, if the accused is sentenced to life imprisonment, the judge may impose a sentence of between 15 and 30 years, with the benefit of mitigating circumstances granted to the accused.</p>

<h3>What ‘type’ of crime would the perpetrator be guilty of, i.e. ‘offence against morality’, ‘crime against the person’, etc.?</h3>

<p>The perpetrator would be guilty of crimes of sexual assault, including rape, indecent assault, and sexual harassment.</p>

<h3>What sentences are judges able to pass down?</h3>

<p>Aside from prison sentencing, judges are able to pass down additional penalties either temporarily or permanently, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forfeiture of certain rights</li>
  <li>prohibited from practising a profession</li>
  <li>local exclusion</li>
  <li>publication of judgment in the media etc</li>
</ul>

<h3>What happens if the alleged perpetrator is found not guilty?</h3>

<p>If the alleged perpetrator is found not guilty, the state prosecutor can appeal within one month.</p>

<p>If the person is finally found not guilty, s/he would be acquitted (under Article 350) and cannot be prosecuted again for the same act (Article 12 of Cambodia Code of Criminal Procedure).</p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<h3>Can the courts order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, either after they have been convicted in a criminal court or as a result of civil action?</h3>

<p>Yes, the court will decide on the compensation to the victim, to be paid by the perpetrator.  Sometimes the prosecutor will claim for compensation on behalf of the victim and at other times the victim must claim for themselves, through their lawyer.</p>

<h3>Is there a state-funded compensation scheme to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a sexual or violent crime, which may apply to foreign nationals as well?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice. Contact details for SARCs in England can be found on the NHS Choices website or can be found by searching the internet for ‘NHS SARC’. If you live in Scotland, you can contact the Archway SARC on 0141 211 8175. If you live in Wales you can contact the New Pathways SARC on 01685 379 310. If you live in Northern Ireland you can contact the Rowan SARC Northern Ireland on 0800 389 4424.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in Cambodia.</p>

<h3>Will local police in Cambodia inform UK police?</h3>

<p>This is very unlikely.</p>

<h3>Will local police ask UK police to undertake police checks on the victim?</h3>

<p>This is very unlikely.</p>
