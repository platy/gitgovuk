<span class="number">2. </span>First steps</h2>

<p>Sexual assault of any type can be a very traumatic experience wherever it happens, but it can be even more difficult to deal with when it happens abroad.</p>

<p>It is your choice what you do next but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you are in Phnom Penh or Siem Reap, we will try and send a consular officer to support you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact the British Embassy in Phnom Penh on +855 (0) 61 300 011 or +855 (0) 61 300 012</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>How the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we will try to see you privately as soon as possible. We will respect your right to privacy, especially around disclosure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we will listen to you and take what you tell us seriously, but the amount of information that you give us is entirely up to you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we will treat anything you tell us in confidence, which means it will normally only be seen by consular staff. We will only pass on information to other agencies (such as the police) and any friends or family, with your consent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you would prefer to speak to a woman or a man about your ordeal, then we will do our best to ensure the consular officer who talks to you is your preferred gender, but this will depend on who is available at the time and cannot be guaranteed. All consular officers will do their best to help you and will not judge you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we can tell you about local police and legal procedures. However, only you can decide whether or not to report the incident to the police or take legal action – we cannot make this decision for you. Whatever you choose, we will respect your wishes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you want to contact the police, we can come to the police station with you. If possible, we can ask that a male or female police officer interviews you if that is what you want. However, we cannot guarantee this request will be met</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we can help you arrange a medical examination. Again, we can try to request a male or female doctor if you prefer but cannot guarantee a doctor of a specific gender will be available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we can contact your family or friends, if that is what you want</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we can give you information on what professional help is available locally and in the UK, both for you and for your family. This includes providing you with a list of local lawyers and interpreters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if we do not know the answer to a question, we will say so and then endeavour to find the information for you or signpost you to someone who knows</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>If you want to report the crime to the police in Cambodia</h2>

<p>Should you decide to make a police report, you should call the police or go to the nearest police station as soon as possible. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you wish to change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes or text messages.</p>

<p>You may want to ask a friend or relative to go to the police station with you – many people find it helps not to be alone.  Consular staff can also accompany you. If you are far from the embassy and we cannot get to you, we will try to liaise with local police via telephone.</p>

<p>In Cambodia the police speak very little English, so it is best to bring a translator with you if you feel able to, be it a friend or a tour guide if you have one. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">list of local translators and interpreters</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that in order to file a complaint, you may need to pay the police officer a fee.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can ask them to inform the British Embassy.</p>

<p>The British Embassy works with Cambodian local authorities to try and ensure survivors of rape and sexual assault receive the best possible assistance. However support, understanding and assistance from local authorities will be limited and will vary significantly across Cambodia.</p>

<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-lawyers--2">list of lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>Currently there are no places in Cambodia that can effectively or reliably manage the collection of, and the chain of evidence for, a medical examination. However, you may wish to have a full medical examination that creates some evidence and if you wish us to, we will accompany you there. The examination can involve a pelvic exam, vaginal/penile/anal swabs, fingernail scrapings and blood samples. These samples may be used as forensic evidence if a case moves forward. If the police have a suspect, they may also instruct them to be examined. You may also choose just to have a medical examination solely for the purpose of your health and not to collect evidence. The choice is entirely yours.</p>

<p>The police may also take pictures of places of your body where there is evidence of violence such as bruises or cuts, and they may ask for some of your clothing. Do not be surprised if the police officer uses their personal phone to take pictures. If they do, you may wish to think about how this makes you feel and whether you are willing to have these images stored on an individual’s phone. You have the right to say no to this.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If you do not want to report the crime to the police in Cambodia</h2>

<p>The British Embassy will still be able to help you. This includes helping you contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK. We can provide you with lists of English speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you do not report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>If you want to report the crime to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is still possible to report a crime when you get back to the UK. However, it is for the Cambodian authorities to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction.  UK police forces cannot investigate a crime committed overseas. Cambodian police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Legal procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>It is also important to manage your expectations regarding the capacity of the police to effectively respond to your needs and the case. Once they have collected evidence the Law on Criminal Procedure provides that the Public Prosecutor receives the complaint and conducts a preliminary investigation in order to decide whether a charge should be laid. If a charge is laid, the case will be handed over to an Investigating Judge. Once an Investigating Judge is appointed, his/her role is to investigate the case and determine whether the matter should go to trial. However, the system is full of irregularities at every step of the way and without support from a local human rights NGO, getting a case to trial is very unlikely. These services are generally not available to foreigners due to the demand not being met locally. However, you have the option of privately engaging a local lawyer to advise you on how to pursue a case if you wish to.</p>

<p>Refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-lawyers--2">list of local lawyers</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Medical insurance</h2>

<p>If you want, we can help you to consult your insurance company. Remember to keep any receipts or doctors’ notes in case you need them to make a claim. We may also be able to help you communicate with hospital / clinic staff in certain situations if they do not speak English.</p>

<p>Medical treatment is not free in Cambodia and we do not pay medical bills. The cost of any treatment received abroad by a British national is their responsibility and cannot be reclaimed from the British National Health Service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Medical treatment</h2>

<p>Your safety and health are paramount. Even if you decide not to report what has happened to the police, we would encourage you to see a medical professional. They can determine if you have been injured in any way and give you advice about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV (ការមានផ្ទៃពោះ និងជំងឺកាមរោគ រួមទាំងមេរោគអេដស៍។).</p>

<p>If you do not speak Khmer, we would encourage you to take a Khmer speaker with you when you go to a hospital or clinic. If you wish, one of our consular officers can accompany you.</p>

<p>It is possible that you will have been exposed to the HIV virus, so you should also ask a doctor about Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). It means taking Antiretroviral Medicines (ART) after potentially being exposed to HIV to prevent becoming infected. PEP must start within 72 hours after exposure to HIV, but the sooner you start, the better. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on your return to the UK.</p>

<p>PEP is available at several clinics in Cambodia and we can signpost you to your nearest clinic. You may need to phone ahead to the clinics to check they have PEP in stock.</p>

<p>More information on this is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" rel="external">NHS’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the incident for it to be effective. No prescription or medical referral is required and you can buy medication over the counter in most pharmacies.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Questions you may have</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Forensic examination</h3>

<h4>Do hospitals automatically report the results of any examination to the police?</h4>

<p>Only if the police or the prosecutor request them to.</p>

<h4>Will the hospital/clinic take photographs?</h4>

<p>No, they should not need to. They should provide a written report only.</p>

<h4>Who carries out the examination, a doctor or a nurse or both?</h4>

<p>The examination should be conducted by a doctor. S/he may be assisted by a nurse.</p>

<h4>Will the police accompany the survivor to the local hospital for an examination?</h4>

<p>By law, a police officer(s) should accompany the survivor to the hospital to ensure the evidence is taken accurately and reliably. However, in reality it is rare for the police to go with the survivor. The police will usually accept any documentation or information provided by the hospital without question.</p>

<p>However, the survivor can request police to accompany them for their own security.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Police investigation</h3>

<h4>Will the survivor have to surrender their passport while any investigation is carried out?</h4>

<p>No, the survivor will not be required to surrender their passport. Passports are only confiscated from foreigners when they have committed a crime, to prevent them fleeing the country.</p>

<h4>Will the survivor have to make a statement about the incident including a description of the attacker(s)?</h4>

<p>Yes, in order to enable the police to have any chance of success, the survivor will need to provide a statement giving as much information/evidence as possible, including a description of their attacker. This statement will be used as evidence at trial. A survivor has the right to refuse to give a statement but it is unlikely a charge would be laid without this.</p>

<h4>Will the police keep any clothes which may be evidence of the attack to present to a forensic examiner?</h4>

<p>Yes, it is possible the police will retain the clothing the survivor was wearing at the time of the attack to be used as evidence in court.</p>

<h4>Will there be both male and female officers to talk to?</h4>

<p>There should be both male and female officers available although this cannot be guaranteed. If you prefer to speak to a male or female officer you should request your preference at the time.</p>

<h4>Do you have to report the crime in country for it to be investigated?</h4>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to the UK police however the possibility of an investigation being conducted once the survivor has left Cambodia is greatly reduced.</p>

<h4>Will the survivor be entitled to a forensic examination if they do not report the crime?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4>Will the police take the survivor to the scene of the crime, or where the survivor thinks the attacker is located to try to identify and arrest the person?</h4>

<p>If the survivor consents and the police consider it is worthwhile then the survivor may be taken to the location. However, if the survivor is not comfortable doing this they can refuse and identify the location another way.</p>

<h4>If a suspect is brought to the police station, will the survivor be asked to make an identification?</h4>

<p>Yes, if the survivor is not comfortable being in the same room as their attacker they can identify the suspect by photograph. The survivor is under no obligation to make an identification but it will obviously help the police investigating the crime if they do so.</p>

<h4>If the police make an arrest, will they take the suspect before the public prosecutor?  How quickly?  What happens after that?</h4>

<p>If the police arrest a suspect they have 48 hours to submit their case to the public prosecutor.</p>

<h4>Will the survivor be allowed to leave the country once the case is filed?</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h4>Will the survivor be expected to go in front of the public prosecutor to make a statement? Can lawyers do this on their behalf?</h4>

<p>Yes. After the file is transferred to the public prosecutor, s/he may invite parties for a further interview and take another statement. At this stage, if the prosecutor accepts the complaint, the case is referred to the investigating judge who will conduct further investigation and interviews. However, if the survivor has already left the country they can file a written statement via a lawyer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Trial stage</h3>

<h4>Should the survivor get their own lawyer?</h4>

<p>It is not compulsory for the survivor to have a lawyer, however, a lawyer can help to draft the complaint for the court. They can also access and review the case and see the statement(s) from the suspect. If a survivor files a complaint and then leaves the country, the only way to obtain updates on the progress of the case would be to engage a lawyer to do this on their behalf.</p>

<h4>Without a lawyer, is the survivor entitled to be kept aware of the case?</h4>

<p>Yes, but they will only be able to do so if they understand court proceedings and know Khmer. Embassy staff cannot monitor the trial or provide updates to the survivor.</p>

<h4>What other benefits does hiring a lawyer bring?</h4>

<p>By hiring a lawyer, the survivor will have legal representation working for their own interests who can keep them informed as the case progresses.</p>

<h4>If a suspect is ordered to trial will the survivor be expected to testify in court?</h4>

<p>The court will usually expect the survivor to be present in court during the trial. However, the survivor can file a written statement through their lawyer if they cannot be present in court. Alternatively, the survivor can request to give evidence via video conferencing – however, the court’s capacity to honour this request will be limited and a survivor should not rely on being able to do this.</p>

<p>The survivor can request the judge, through their lawyer, to conduct a closed hearing.</p>

<h4>Is it possible to drop charges once they are filed if the survivor wishes to?</h4>

<p>Even if the survivor withdraws from the proceedings the case will be taken through to its conclusion – whether the suspect is found innocent, guilty or the case is dropped due to lack of evidence.</p>

<p>Once the survivor withdraws the complaint, they lose the chance to claim for compensation. There is also the possibility that the judge will anyway invite the survivor to give evidence as a witness.</p>

<h4>If the survivor withdraws from the proceedings are there any legal repercussions?</h4>

<p>No, except that the survivor may still be invited to give evidence as a witness.</p>

<h4>Can the survivor face a charge for withdrawing from proceedings?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4>Can the alleged assailant press counter charges claiming false accusations?</h4>

<p>Yes, but the same process applies – the prosecutor must decide if there is sufficient evidence to go forward.</p>

<h4>Can the courts order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, either after they have been convicted in a criminal court or as a result of civil action?</h4>

<p>Yes, the court will decide on the compensation to the survivor, to be paid by the perpetrator. Sometimes the prosecutor will claim for compensation on behalf of the survivor and at other times the survivor must claim for themselves, through their lawyer.</p>

<h4>Is there a state funded compensation scheme to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a violent crime, which may apply to foreign nationals as well?</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<span class="number">13. </span>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>See our leaflet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after rape or sexual assault abroad</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You may want to let your GP or Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually-transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in Cambodia.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>UK national/resident perpetrator(s)</h2>

<p>If your attacker is a UK resident, you may be able to get protection from them in the UK by, for example, getting an injunction to keep the offender away from you. You should speak to a lawyer when you return to the UK about options available to you.</p>

<p>If you are under 18 and the suspect is a UK national (or UK resident), UK police forces may be able to prosecute the suspect in the UK for a serious sexual offence committed outside the UK under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Your local police station should be able to advise or refer your case to the Crown Prosecution Service or Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for consideration.</p>
