<p>The agreement is not yet in force. Both the UK and New Zealand are required to complete their respective domestic procedures for the agreement to come into effect. Once approved by both parliaments, businesses will be able to trade under its terms.</p>
</div>

<p>Our shared history, common values and commitment to free trade is matched by a dedication to high standards and the rule of law. It makes complete sense for the UK to do a trade deal with New Zealand, which will make us stronger allies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Levelling up the UK</h2>
<p>This deal will deliver benefits to people, businesses and communities throughout the country – supporting the levelling up agenda. It is expected to increase trade with New Zealand by almost 60%, boost the economy by £800 million and add £200 million to household wages in the long-run.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Red tape cut for small businesses</h2>
<p>Red tape will be slashed for the 5,900 UK small and medium-sized enterprises (<abbr title="small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr>) that export goods to New
Zealand. These businesses employed 233,000 people in 2020.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> Simple and modern customs procedures, including a commitment to release goods within 48 hours of arrival if requirements have been met, will save time and money for businesses. A dedicated chapter in the agreement will provide <abbr title="small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> with practical advice and support to find opportunities and links to commercial partners in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Tariff-free access for British goods</h2>
<p>At <strong>entry into force</strong>, businesses will benefit from the immediate removal of tariffs on 100% of UK goods exports, worth £17 million annually. These tariff reductions include clothing (up to 10%), footwear (up to 10%), buses (5%), ships (up to 5%) and bulldozers and excavators (up to 5%). Flexible rules of origin will also give UK firms
an advantage over international rivals in the New Zealand import market, a market which is expected to grow by around 30% by 2030.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Better investment opportunities</h2>
<p>This agreement will protect investors and increase opportunities in both countries, making it easier for UK businesses to expand their footprint and become more profitable in New Zealand. Higher screening thresholds mean that fewer UK investments will be subject to review under New Zealand’s overseas investment regime. This will limit barriers and lead to savings for UK businesses, who owned £900 million worth of foreign direct investment in New Zealand in 2020.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Global leadership on climate and environment</h2>
<p>This deal includes a ground-breaking environment chapter that reinforces our commitments to the Paris Agreement and our efforts to meet net zero. It will also encourage trade and investment in low carbon goods, services and technology, with the most comprehensive list of environmental goods with liberalised tariffs in a trade deal to date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Opening new digital markets</h2>
<p>The deal will cut red tape for our advanced tech and services companies, making it easier to break into the New Zealand market. Customs duties on electronic transmissions, such as software, will be prohibited. Easier e-commerce and the free flow of trusted data, essential for modern businesses, will be guaranteed between the UK and New Zealand. In 2019, 40% of the UK’s £651 million of services exports to New Zealand were delivered digitally.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Boosting the UK’s world-leading services sector</h2>
<p>The deal guarantees that British service suppliers – from accountancy and legal services to financial services and
engineering – can compete in New Zealand on an equal footing. It will keep licensing and authorisation procedures transparent and straightforward, help facilitate the recognition of UK qualifications in New Zealand, support innovation in financial services, and promote the UK’s leadership in fintech. The deal could increase the gross value added of the financial and professional business services sectors by around £105 million (compared to 2019 levels).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>More opportunities to work in and travel to New Zealand for business</h2>
<p>Brits will be able to work more freely in New Zealand thanks to unprecedented new commitments that allow UK service suppliers, including lawyers and auditors, to deliver contracts. It will be easier for senior managers, executives and specialists to move on intra-company transfers. They will be eligible for visas to work for a period of 3 years and family members will also be able to join.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Kiwi quality at lower prices</h2>
<p>Consumers will benefit directly from increased choice, better product quality and lower prices for imported goods.
Removing tariffs could make high-quality products that British consumers love more affordable, including Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, Manuka Honey and kiwi fruit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Paves the way to <abbr title="Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership">CPTPP</abbr>
</h2>
<p>This deal is another step towards our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (<abbr title="Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership">CPTPP</abbr>), a major trans-pacific trading bloc. Joining <abbr title="Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership">CPTPP</abbr> would hitch the UK to some of the world’s biggest current and future economies, populated by half a billion people and with a joint gross domestic product (<abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr>) of £8.4 trillion in 2020.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>
