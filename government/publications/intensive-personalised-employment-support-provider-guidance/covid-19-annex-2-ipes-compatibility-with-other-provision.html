Wherever possible, they support the young person to move into paid employment at the end of the programme. <br><br>  Alongside their time at the employer, young people complete a personalised study programme which includes the chance to study for relevant substantial qualifications and English and maths, if appropriate.  <br><br>Traineeships: <br><br>  From August 2013, young people aged 16 to 23 can participate in traineeships as another strand of study programmes. This includes, where appropriate, young people with a <abbr title="Learning Difficulty Assessment">LDA</abbr> or EHC plan up to academic age 25, who are qualified below Level 3. <br><br> Traineeships last a maximum of six months and offer a work placement, work preparation training, and studies in English and maths where the students have still to achieve GCSEs at grade C, plus additional flexible training and support tailored to individual needs. <br><br> The aim of traineeships is to support young people to gain the skills, attributes and experience they need to progress onto apprenticeships or other jobs.</td>
