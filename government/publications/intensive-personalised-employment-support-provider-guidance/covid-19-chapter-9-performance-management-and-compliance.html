<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions operates a robust Performance Management (<abbr title="Performance Management">PM</abbr>) regime to ensure contracts deliver value for money for the taxpayer and to ensure Providers are accountable for delivering what is outlined in their contract.</p>

<p>9.01. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Employment Account Division, which has responsibility for performance management, has developed this Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>) to support the delivery of provision and to underpin your contract.</p>

<p>9.02. You will be responsible for managing the contract, including addressing poor performance with sub-contractors, and will need to ensure that all systems and processes (including tracking) used for the monitoring and recording of performance are robust, provide a clear audit trail of evidence, and give confidence to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that you and your supply chain are delivering the contract.</p>

<h2>Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will employ an active and consistent Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>).</p>

<p>9.03. Provider performance against Required Number of Outcomes (<abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>), Tender Minimum Performance Levels (<abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Levels">tMPLs</abbr>), Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>) and Performance Indicators (<abbr title="Performance Indicators">PI</abbr>) will be managed on both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the contracts, including, but not limited to, an in-month, rolling 3-month, rolling 12-month and cumulative basis from day one of the contract.</p>

<p>9.04. Performance Improvement action will be considered on a monthly basis where contracted targets have not been achieved. Providers will be required to deliver performance in line with Cohort Profiles.</p>

<p>9.05. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will manage your performance at the headline Contact Package Area (<abbr title="Contact Package Area">CPA</abbr>) level, and may take performance improvement action should your performance against any RNO, tMPL, CSS or <abbr title="Performance Indicators">PI</abbr> fall below the levels stipulated in your Contract.</p>

<p>9.06. There are 4 levels of this regime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Standard Action – <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager-led</li>
  <li>Level 2: Enhanced Action – <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager/Senior Performance Manager-led</li>
  <li>Level 3: Informal Action – <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Provision Lead-led</li>
  <li>Level 4: Formal Action – <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Provision Lead-led</li>
</ul>

<p>9.07. Please note that whilst the <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> follows a sequential order of escalation, there may be occasions where an initial intervention at a higher level may be appropriate.</p>

<p>9.08. For the avoidance of doubt, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be entitled to take action at Level 4 whether or not it has taken all of the steps outlined at Levels 1, 2 and/or 3.</p>

<p>9.09. At each level of intervention, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager will continue to work closely with you and the frequency, scope, and types of activity will increase if matters escalate.</p>

<h3>Level 1: Standard Action</h3>

<p>9.10. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will hold regular discussions with you, including Contract Performance Reviews (<abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr>), which will focus on performance against the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the contracts, including, but not limited to, an in-month, rolling three-month, rolling 12-month and cumulative basis from day one of the contract.</p>

<p>9.11. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Managers will work with you to set up a “<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Action Plan”. The purpose of the <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Action Plan is to provide assurance that you have identified the priority areas for performance and will include specific actions that you will take in these areas. It will also include incremental performance and pipeline data for you and any subcontractors that may lead to outcomes, review dates and the cohort management information to improve the extent to which you are meeting <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>, <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Levels">tMPLs</abbr> of and Customer Service Standards in line with the Contract.</p>

<p>9.12. The <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Action Plan is to be populated by you and must fully address any and all areas of performance required to meet the contractual requirements. The actions must be specific about the required activity, and these actions must be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound. Action plans should be updated monthly and sent to Performance Managers at least five working days prior to a Contract Performance Review meeting. An example of the Provider Action Plan to be used will be provided by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. However, you may use your own version if preferred, as long as it includes all areas covered in the example provided</p>

<p>9.13. The <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Action Plan is required to be in place from day one of the Contract and will be reviewed in your discussions with your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager.</p>

<h3>Level 2: Enhanced Action</h3>

<p>9.14. If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> believes that you have not/may not achieve the <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>, or have not met/may not meet the <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Levels">tMPLs</abbr> and/or the Customer Service Standards set out in your Contract, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager will consult the Senior Performance Manager. This discussion will focus on, but may not be limited to, areas of concern, action already taken, and your current inability to address the performance, compliance, or service delivery issues.</p>

<p>9.15. A management letter confirming the escalation to Level 2 and the reason for this will be issued to you. Following this you will be required to present an enhanced Action Plan including, for example, a flightpath for performance improvement at a subsequent meeting with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager/Senior Performance Manager.</p>

<h3>Level 3: Informal Action - Nationally Led</h3>

<p>9.16. If the remedial actions shown on the enhanced Action Plan have not resulted in the improvement in performance required by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the Performance Manager and Senior Performance Manager will consult the National Provision Lead and other key stakeholders, for example, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Commercial Directorate, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Policy, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Strategy, to agree next steps.</p>

<p>9.17. A management letter confirming the seriousness of the escalation and the reason for this action will be issued to you and will include an invitation to attend a meeting with, for example, senior <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> performance management and commercial officials to discuss matters further.</p>

<h3>Level 4: Formal Action - Nationally Led</h3>

<p>9.18. If your performance has not improved sufficiently and you are not meeting the requirements of the Contract <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may take formal action in accordance with the Contract. This may include issuing a Performance Improvement Notice (<abbr title="Performance Improvement Notice">PIN</abbr>) and thereby initiating the Performance Improvement Process in order to address any Service Failures.</p>

<p>9.19. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Employment Account Division and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Commercial Directorate will work with you to support the completion of a Performance Improvement Plan (<abbr title="Performance Improvement Plan">PIP</abbr>) and will undertake activities to monitor and support improvement to your performance. If a Performance Improvement Plan is agreed but you fail to implement it in accordance with its terms such that you fail to rectify the Service Failure by the date specified in the <abbr title="Performance Improvement Notice">PIN</abbr> then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may, at its absolute discretion, but shall not be obliged to, terminate the Contract.</p>

<p>9.20. Nothing in this Guidance shall exclude any rights or remedies provided to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in the Contract, by Law, in equity or otherwise.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Guidance and the provisions of the Contract, the provisions of the Contract shall take precedence over this Guidance.</p>

<p>9.21. Nothing in this Guidance shall exclude any rights or remedies provided to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in the Contract, by Law, in equity or otherwise.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Guidance and the provisions of the Contract, the provisions of the Contract shall take precedence over this Guidance.</p>

<h2>Performance Indicators (PIs)</h2>

<p>9.23. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will share the following information with Providers relating to the validation of earnings-based Outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant’s earnings are first declared to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) following a confirmed start on the Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) provision; and</li>
  <li>when lower and higher earnings thresholds are reached</li>
</ul>

<p>9.22. Each provider has specified a predicted ‘Earnings <abbr title="Performance Indicators">PI</abbr>’. This <abbr title="Performance Indicators">PI</abbr> is the number of Participants each month that you anticipate will need to have earned an income from employment to achieve the relevant Outcomes to meet the Lower and Higher Threshold Outcome <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.25. If, following a Performance Indicator Review, the ‘Earnings <abbr title="Performance Indicators">PI</abbr>’ is not met, or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> considers that without intervention the Earnings <abbr title="Performance Indicators">PI</abbr> will fall below the required standard, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may issue a Performance Indicator Course of Action Notice in accordance with Schedule 3 of the Terms and Conditions of your Contract.</p>

<p>9.26. This action may be implemented with a view to avoiding a failure to achieve the relevant RNO.</p>

<p>9.27. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is under no obligation to initiate or pursue the Performance Indicator Course of Action and it may choose in its absolute discretion to exercise any other right or remedy available to it under this Contract instead, or running in parallel with, initiating and pursuing the Performance Indicator Course of Action.</p>

<h2>Cohort Profiles and Management Information</h2>

<p>9.28. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will measure your performance using a cohort and a profiled cohort measure based on the information you provided as part of your tender and which has been incorporated into your Contract. You will be measured against the individual cohort profiles in the <abbr title="Contact Package Area">CPA</abbr>. A cohort will relate to Starts in a calendar month, for example, all the Participants where the start date entered on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> falls in the relevant calendar month. Further information can be found in Chapter 13 - Management Information.</p>

<p>9.29. An Employed Job Outcome may be either a Lower Threshold Employed Outcome or a Higher Threshold Employed Outcome. An Employed Job Outcome is achieved when a Participant’s earnings reach an earnings threshold calculated by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as equivalent to the Participant working at the National Living Wage (<abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>).</p>

<p>9.30.	Earnings equivalent to 8 hours per week for 182 days, at the adult rate (aged 25 or over) of the National Living Wage (<abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>). This currently stands at £1,976, (the “lower threshold outcome”) and will be uprated in line with <abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>; and,</p>

<p>9.31.	At a higher threshold calculated at 16 hours per week for 182 days at the adult rate (aged 25 or over) of the <abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>. This currently stands at £3,952 (the “higher threshold outcome”) and will be uprated in line with <abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.32. Achievement of these Employed Job Outcomes will be identified automatically by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.33. Please refer to Chapter 7 of this guidance for further information on Outcomes.</p>

<p>9.34. Self-Employed Outcomes will be achieved when the Participant has been trading on a self-employed basis for a cumulative period of 91 days (the “Lower Threshold Self-Employed Outcome”) and 182 days (the “Higher Threshold Self-Employed Outcome”) within the period the Participant is on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision.</p>

<p>9.35. As part of making a successful claim for Self Employed Outcomes, the Provider will need to identify and submit self-employment claims through <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> systems within (i) a maximum of 90 calendar days from the date the conditions for such Self-Employed Outcome have been met AND (ii) within a maximum of 700 calendar days from the date the Participant in respect of whom the Self-Employed Outcome Payment is being claimed started on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision.</p>

<p>9.36. For employed Participants, data relating to performance against these Cohort Profiles will be taken from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> data, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> system and, in the case of self-employed Participants, such data will be taken from claims submitted by you for Self Employed Outcomes.</p>

<p>9.37. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> produces Management Information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) Packs on a monthly basis and these <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> packs will contain the data input to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> regarding Participants, and performance against the Cohort Profiles, <abbr title="Required Number of Outcomes">RNOs</abbr>, TMPLs and Customer Service Standards in the Contract, and will allow <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to monitor performance in respect of a cohort across various time periods including 1 month, rolling 3 months, rolling 12 months and cumulative from day 1 of the Contract.</p>

<p>9.38. You will be required to provide a monthly performance return (supplier <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) containing key data that drives the performance of the Contract. This will be in a form agreed with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> following discussion, and is likely to include, but is not limited to, information such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of supplier and end-to-end supply chain staff working on this Contract (including data on absences) and in what roles, including a full-time equivalent (<abbr title="full-time equivalent">FTE</abbr>) breakdown</li>
  <li>caseload sizes per Key Worker (including the average and maximum caseload size each of your, and your end-to-end supply chain,)</li>
  <li>the number of people participating within the main element of the supplier delivery model</li>
  <li>supplier performance against the Customer Service Standards</li>
  <li>participant attendance face-to-face and other agreed methods of engagement; and</li>
  <li>the performance and management from each prime delivery location and of the supply chain including information on any commercial action you are taking against your supply partners</li>
</ul>

<p>9.39. Activity will centre on monthly Contract Performance Review meetings (<abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr>) to manage your performance. These meetings will be the key vehicles through which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> manages delivery of services in accordance with the Contract.</p>

<h2>Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>9.40. The purpose of the Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) is to formally examine with you your performance for individual contract(s). All relevant aspects of performance will be assessed against contractual requirements.</p>

<p>9.41. The usual frequency of <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> is monthly; however, this can be reviewed as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Content of the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> meeting</h2>

<p>9.42. The <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> will focus on the ongoing achievement of performance levels and Customer Service Standards and depending on priority issues for each meeting, is likely to cover some or all of the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action points outstanding from previous meeting</li>
  <li>performance</li>
  <li>expected future performance based on information available (for example, earning commencements and current performance levels)</li>
  <li>review of Action Plan – including improvement expectations agreed at the last meeting</li>
  <li>sub-contractor (end-to-end performance) and Supply Chain performance</li>
  <li>employer engagement</li>
  <li>collaborative working (including Operational Process Updates and feedback from the Jobcentre)</li>
  <li>participant experience, good news stories and complaints</li>
  <li>Compliance Monitoring</li>
  <li>Performance Manager checks</li>
  <li>exit feedback/CV/references</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy changes – latest <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> memos</li>
  <li>partnership working with Local Services and Charities</li>
  <li>resources / premises variations, staffing and caseload sizes</li>
  <li>feedback on delivery of the Additional Services Innovation  contract variations, where awarded.</li>
</ul>

<p>(This list is not exhaustive)</p>

Depending on the priority of issues identified for the meeting, the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> is likely to last an hour and a half (longer if required). PMs will use the available <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>, action logs, supporting documents, results from compliance monitoring checks and the Action Plan to lead performance discussions. Any areas of improvement or weakness will be highlighted during the discussion and captured in your Action Plan. The <abbr title="Performance Management">PM</abbr> will challenge you to meet your targets and be clear about any intervention action which may be taken should the performance levels or the Customer Service Standards in the Contract not be met.</p>

<p>9.45. Subcontractor and supply-chain performance: You will be asked about the performance of subcontractors delivering end-to-end services on your behalf, as well as the performance of other delivery partners including specialists.

<h2>Performance Requirements</h2>

<p>9.55. The performance levels you are required to deliver are set out in schedule 2 of your Contract.</p>

<p>9.56. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will actively monitor the service you deliver against these performance levels. This will be done using a combination of <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>-based management information and Compliance Monitoring checks. The following tables and paragraphs show the categories under which performance will be measured and managed, and the standards which relate to the delivery of customer service.</p>

<p>9.57. The Tender Minimum Performance Levels (<abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Levels">tMPLs</abbr>) are the performance levels offered by you in your Final Offer which are set out in Schedule 2 of the Contract.</p>

<p>9.60. Failure to meet one or more of the CSS’s could constitute a Service Fee Deferral Failure and lead to deferral and/or forfeit of the Service Fee.</p>

<h2>Deferral and Forfeiture of the Service Fee</h2>

<p>9.61. Payment of the Service Fee, as described in Section 5 of the Specification, will be subject to meeting the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>. The basic principles for application of deferral and forfeiture of the Service Fee are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where a Provider fails to meet any of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may defer payment of 50% of each monthly Service Fee payment until the failure is rectified</li>
  <li>where deferral has been ongoing for at least six (6) Months <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may forfeit any payments which had been deferred during that period</li>
  <li>where the period during which referrals are made under the contract comes to an end any payments which are deferred are automatically forfeit</li>
</ul>

<p>9.62. Clause C6 of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Terms &amp; Conditions sets out the detail relating to   deferral and forfeiture of the Service Fee.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fifty percent (50%) of the monthly Service Fee can be deferred where the Provider has failed to meet one or more of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider whether to defer Service Fee payments if a Provider has failed to meet the same CSS in two (2) Months out of three (3). However, this is without prejudice to the wider right of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to defer payment of the Service Fee in accordance with clause C6</li>
  <li>where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> proposes to exercise its right to defer the monthly Service Fee it shall issue a notice to the Provider before doing so</li>
  <li>deferral of the monthly Service Fee payments shall continue until such time as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> assesses that the Provider has met the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> retains a discretion to decide when it will measure whether a Provider has met the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>, and the period over which the Provider’s compliance with the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> will be assessed</li>
  <li>if <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> determines that a Provider has met the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>, then the amounts previously deferred become payable unless the amounts previously deferred have been forfeited</li>
  <li>where the deferral of the Service Fee has been ongoing for a period of six (6) Months or more then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has the right to forfeit any payments that have been deferred during that period</li>
  <li>where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> proposes to exercise its right to forfeit the amounts previously deferred, it shall issue a notice to the Provider before doing so</li>
  <li>where the period during which referrals are made under the contract comes to an end any payments which are deferred are automatically forfeit</li>
</ul>

<p>9.63. If a Provider is unable to remedy a ‘failure’ for which the Service Fee has been deferred, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has the option to forfeit any deferred payments if deferral of the Service Fee has been ongoing for a period of six months or more. The Contractor does not have any right to receive, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not have any obligation to pay, any Service Fee Periodic Payments that are forfeited in accordance with clauses C6.9 to C6.12 of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Ts &amp; Cs.</p>

<p>9.64. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Compliance Officer (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr>) checks will be conducted to measure your compliance with <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Customer Service Standards and your tender.</p>

<p>9.65. You are required to deliver the performance levels against the Customer Service Standards set out in Schedule 2 of your Contract.</p>

<p>9.66. Each CSS will be monitored using the most appropriate method, either <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>-based and/or Compliance Monitoring, from day one; any failure to meet the agreed level for a CSS may result in performance improvement action being instigated.</p>

<h2>Customer Service Standards (CSS) – Case Conferences</h2>

<p>9.67. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have taken the decision to allow providers certain flexibility within the delivery of the Case Conference process, as set out in Chapter 13 of this Provider Guidance, and CSS are not presently required.</p>

<p>9.68. Providers should be aware, however, that as the Case Conference process is new to contracted provision, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor its usage throughout the lifetime of the programme. Once <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has an evidence base, Case Conferences will be reviewed and the way forward discussed with providers. This may include introducing specific Customer Service Standards.</p>

<p>9.69. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to amend the Case Conference process to ensure alignment with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> business processes.</p>

<p>9.70. An example of the CSS template to be used will be provided by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.71. Nothing in this Guidance shall exclude any rights or remedies provided to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in the Contract, by Law, in equity or otherwise.  In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Guidance and the provisions of the Contract, the provisions of the Contract shall take precedence over this Guidance.</p>

<h2>Compliance Monitoring</h2>

<p>9.72. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff, including Performance Compliance Officer (PCOs), perform regular evidence-based checks to identify if Providers are adhering to the delivery models set out in their contracts.</p>

<p>9.73. This includes checking samples of Participant records held by Providers for all related activity, and to ensure that a Participant has reached the relevant earnings threshold and that Outcome Payments have been correctly made.</p>

<p>9.74. Final (approved) compliance lists of checks to be carried out have been sent to Providers during contract award/go live.</p>

<p>9.75. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will specify the location where the checks will take place and expects them to be centralised in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> locations or undertaken digitally and remotely by sharing of screens through Microsoft Teams. However, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> retains the option for PCOs to carry out the checks in Provider’s’ premises where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decides this is appropriate. All records must be available on the Provider’s system for inspection.</p>

<p>9.76. The sample of Participants to be checked will be sent to Providers 12 days prior to the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr> checks being carried out. It is expected that Providers will undertake their own compliance checks on the sample and will return their completed checks to the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr> before the agreed compliance meeting date. This 12-day requirement is to ensure Providers can have fully informed discussions regarding the sample when the compliance checks are carried out.</p>

<p>9.77. Providers are expected to have the necessary remote <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> equipment, which must comply with the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policies as defined in the appropriate section of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Terms &amp; Conditions, which Providers can bring to the location to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to carry out centralised checks of Providers’ systems; this includes the provision of any necessary electronic evidence that is required by the <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr> to undertake the checks effectively.</p>

<p>9.78. The sample of records to be checked will be selected randomly using a method chosen by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The frequency, periodicity and size of the samples may change throughout the contract period. Where a Provider holds more than one <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> contract, a sample may be drawn from across a selection (up to and including all) of the Provider’s <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> contracts.</p>

<p>9.79. All issues arising from <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr> checks are reported to the Provider and relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders. Contract Performance Review meetings with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Performance Managers will include discussions around compliance issues identified by PCOs. Actions to address areas of concern re: compliance should be included in your <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Action Plan.</p>

<p>9.80. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to carry out physical checks on documentation as part of this process.</p>

<h2>Performance Manager Checks</h2>

<p>9.81. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff, including Performance Managers, may undertake checks to complement those already undertaken by the PCOs, by looking more in depth at individual cases.</p>

<p>9.82. The checks will focus on the Participant’s journey, seeking assurances that Providers are addressing the Participants’ barriers to employment, and to test that Providers approach is in line with their Contract.</p>

<p>9.83. The checks may also include a ‘go-look-see’ approach where the <abbr title="Performance Management">PM</abbr> will observe a range of activities, including jobsearch and the initial engagement meetings. These will not only be with the Provider, but also end-to-end delivery partners and sub-contractors (if appropriate). PMs may also undertake “deep dives” into specific areas to understand where there are specific areas of weakness. PMs may also ask to attend sub-contractor end-to-end delivery and supply chain meetings, and accompany Performance Managers on their meetings/visits to Providers’ sub-contractors and supply chain partners.</p>

<p>9.84. The findings from the checks will feed into a Provider’s <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> meeting.</p>

<h3>Evaluation and Reporting</h3>

<p>9.85. Independent evaluation will be an important element of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Provision and Providers will be asked to co-operate in a range of evaluations commissioned by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.86. Other interested parties and Government Departments as part of wider cross-government agendas may commission further evaluations and Providers’ assistance will be expected when required.</p>

<p>9.87. As part of this evaluation work, researchers may wish to visit and interview Providers and their sub-contractors and supply chain, Participants and employers involved in <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. Providers may be asked to provide the relevant contact details and in order to facilitate this process Providers should seek advance agreement from Participants to take part in evaluations.</p>

<p>9.88. Advance notice will be given to Providers where cooperation is required.</p>

<p>9.89. An end of project evaluation report will also be required, highlighting innovative delivery practices and achievements against the cross-cutting themes.</p>

<h2>Programme Provider Assurance Team</h2>

<p>9.90. The primary purpose of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Contract Management and Partner Delivery (<abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr>) Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) is to provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with assurance that Providers’ internal control systems are such that payments made to Providers are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s and the Treasury’s requirements.</p>

<p>9.91. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews test Providers’ internal control systems to establish how effective they are at managing risk to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in relation to <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> expenditure, service delivery and data security.</p>

<p>9.92. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will review Providers’ internal control systems to assess their ability to manage risk across these key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Governance Arrangements – this covers the Providers’ governance arrangements, their systems for tracking and reporting performance and their anti-fraud measures</li>
  <li>Service Delivery – this includes the Providers’ systems for starting, ending and moving Participants through provision and aims to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> receives the service it pays for. This section also covers management of the supply chain</li>
  <li>claim procedures and payments – this aims to ensure that Providers have effective systems in place to support claims for payment, including segregation of duties where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>9.93. The <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> operates at a national level enabling it to present Providers operating across regions with a single view of the effectiveness of their systems. Each Provider will have a nominated Senior Provider Assurance Manager who will be their point of contact within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for management of assurance related issues/concerns.</p>

<p>9.94. On completion of each <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> review, <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> awards each Provider with an assurance rating from four categories – weak, limited, reasonable, strong. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> sends to each of the Providers a formal report which details the review findings including key strengths and areas for improvement. Where weaknesses are identified, the Provider is asked to complete an action plan setting out appropriate steps for improvement and this is followed up by the <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> at an agreed time.</p>

<p>9.95. The timescale for a subsequent <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> review is determined by several risk factors; these include the Provider’s current assurance rating, the contract value and intelligence from internal stakeholders. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews are conducted over a period of up to five months. The resource allocated to each review depends on the complexity of the contract delivery.</p>

<p>9.96. Findings from each review are routinely reported to the relevant category managers/Performance Managers and other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may take action in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if, following a weak or limited assurance level from <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>, the Provider’s subsequent assurance level is the same or worse for the same reasons, or if the Provider is awarded a consecutive third weak or limited assurance, regardless of the reasons</li>
  <li>following a review, if the Provider fails to submit and/or implement the action plan within the agreed timescale</li>
  <li>where there are suspicions that a Provider may be acting inappropriately <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will refer to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Internal Investigations team who are trained to carry out formal investigations; or</li>
  <li>where there are serious concerns around data security these are reported to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Provider Security Team</li>
</ul>

<p>9.97. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may periodically publish Provider assurance levels and names (but this will not include reports or supporting information) in order to respond to a Freedom of Information request and to support <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s commitment to public transparency.</p>

<p>9.98. The <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will work with Providers to ensure they understand what is expected of them and are adequately equipped to develop robust systems to support their service delivery model throughout the duration of the Contract.</p>
