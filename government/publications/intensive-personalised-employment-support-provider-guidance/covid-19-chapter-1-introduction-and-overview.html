<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.01. The government confirmed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-lives-the-future-of-work-health-and-disability">Improving Lives: the future of work, health and disability Command Paper</a> published in 2017, that it is committed to helping disabled people and those with health conditions move nearer to the labour market and, when ready, into work by building more personalised tailored employment and health support, and supporting the Government’s goal to see 1 million more disabled people in work between 2017 and 2027</p>

<p>1.02. Data shows there are currently around 700,000 claimants who expect to find work but are likely to have complex support needs which would put them in the harder to help category. Support for the harder to help must be available nationally to ensure they are given every opportunity to be able to find and maintain work and to help maintain equality.</p>

<p>1.03. Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) has been designed to support individuals within this group into work and to empower those furthest away from the labour market to find sustainable employment or self-employment, or develop the skills to do so.</p>

<p>1.04. This <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Programme-Specific Provider Guidance supports you, the provider, in the delivery of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. It provides guidance on processes for the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> programme and requirements, supporting the programme contract details and the legal arrangements for delivery.</p>

<p>1.05.The Authority has issued this Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) specific Provider Guidance and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance to help provide Contractors (and their sub-contractors) with operational clarity and guidance.</p>

<p>1.06. This guidance must be read in conjunction with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ‘Intensive Personalised Employment Support Invitation to Tender – Specification and Supporting Information’</li>
  <li>Your Terms and Conditions</li>
  <li>Your Contract</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Guidance</a>, and Protection of Vulnerable Groups Scheme</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT Systems User Guidance</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Supplier Code of Conduct</li>
</ul>

<p>1.07. You must ensure that any organisations with which you have a sub-contractual relationship also have access to, and have read, this guidance.</p>

<p>1.08. If you have any questions which are not covered by this guidance, please raise with your Performance Manager in the first instance.</p>

<h2>Data Protection Legislation and Data Sharing</h2>

<p>1.09.You must ensure that you follow the requirements around Data Protection Legislation and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) taking into account your Contract Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

<p>1.10. In relation to the sharing of data, providers should also adhere to all requirements as laid out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Information Security</a>.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Charter</h2>

<p>1.11. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is committed to providing high quality and efficient services to our customers. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-customer-charter"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Charter</a> sets out the standards that customers can expect and what their responsibilities are in return.</p>

<p>1.12. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is dedicated to raising the standards of all our contracted provision and require all providers and sub-contractors to embed the principles of the Customer Charter into the services you deliver on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s behalf. The ‘shared promise on customer care’ developed by the Employment Related Services Association and supported by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, makes the commitments given in the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Customer Charter more specific for welfare to work providers to sign the Shared Promise, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect providers to support the commitments contained in it.</p>

<h2>The Disability Confident Scheme</h2>

<p>1.13. Providers will clearly demonstrate that they are playing a significant role in developing the confidence of employers to accommodate disabled people in their workplace and understand the principles of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://disabilityconfident.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">Disability Confident</a>.</p>

<p>1.14. Disability Confident is creating a movement of change, encouraging employers to think differently about disability and take action to improve how they recruit, retain and develop disabled employees.</p>

<p>1.15. As Disability Confident Leaders, Providers will be showing disabled people that they are serious about leading the way and helping other businesses become Disability Confident. More information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/disability-confident-how-to-sign-up-to-the-employer-scheme">Disability confident – how to sign up the employer scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Intensive Personalised Employment Support Programme.</h2>

<p>1.16. Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) is a voluntary provision aimed specifically at disabled people (as defined under the Equality Act 2010), with complex barriers to employment for whom other support such as the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) is unsuitable.</p>

<p>1.17. Complex barriers to work means that the Participant will have multiple barriers which may not arise solely from a Participant’s disability. There may be a combination of personal and work-related barriers which impact on their readiness to be able to get into and remain in work. This may be an impairment or condition which significantly increases their barrier to work, for example a learning disability, or barriers such as homelessness, intra family violence, financial support needs, substance misuse or low self-esteem preventing them from focusing on, or finding, employment.</p>

<p>1.18. Due to their circumstances, <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Participants will require an intensive, highly personalised support package that is flexible to their needs, and more than that provided by other, larger, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes.</p>

<p>1.19. <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> is designed to assist those more than 12 months from the job market to secure and sustain paid employment, or self-employment, through an individually tailored combination of guidance, learning and training.</p>

<p>1.20. This includes helping Participants to overcome barriers to enable them to secure paid employment, or to become suitable for wider provision following intensive support.</p>

<p>1.21. Providers will also work with local Signposting Organisations (<abbr title="Signposting Organisations">SOs</abbr>) who will be able to signpost individuals that they think will benefit from <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> to the Jobcentre, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap5">Chapter 5</a> of this guidance.</p>

<p>1.22. Providers must, as part of supporting the Participant into sustained employment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support them in focusing on what they can achieve in overcoming the personal and work related barriers they face, providing support that is tailored to their individual needs</li>
  <li>Participate in a warm handover referral meeting with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the potential Participant</li>
  <li>Ensure they have a consistent Key Worker throughout their time on provision, and during the In-Work Support (<abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr>) period</li>
  <li>Offer Participants a minimum of weekly face to face contact and any additional contact as required. As a minimum, face to face contact must take place every four weeks throughout the full time on the programme</li>
  <li>Establish or link up with the Participant’s wider support network, which may include family, peers, health and social care services, and other local services, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap6">Chapter 6</a> of this guidance</li>
  <li>Ensure that all Participants gain meaningful experience in a work environment during their period of support on the programme, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap6">Chapter 6</a> of this guidance</li>
  <li>Support Participants whose health conditions may fluctuate, and who may require a break in provision – as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap4">Chapter 4</a> of this Guidance</li>
  <li>Provide intensive In-Work Support including up-skilling employers and the participant’s wider support network to continue support once the provision has ended</li>
  <li>As agreed with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and set out in your Contract, facilitate three-way Case Conferencing (Participant, Provider and JCP Representative) to ensure that the focus throughout is on the Participant’s progress and Action Plan, and so that the Participant and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> remain in touch. Further information can be found at Chapter 4 of this guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>1.23. All Participants, including those from signposting organisations, will be referred to you by the Jobcentre, who will have used the relevant criteria to identify eligible and suitable Participants for the provision.</p>

<p>1.24. The Jobcentre is the final decision maker for determining if an individual is eligible and suitable for the provision.</p>

<h2>The Participant Journey</h2>

<p>1.25. The Participant journey is made up of three defined areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial Engagement and assessment</li>
  <li>Pre-Work Support</li>
  <li>In-Work Support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant Journey</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Initial Engagement and assessment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The focus in the introduction period will be on forging successful relationships, getting to know the Participant and building trust</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At this stage, the dedicated key worker will begin to identify and address the Participant’s barriers to work, and work on an Action Plan to help plan the journey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work will begin on building and /or strengthening the Participant’s support network</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Pre-Work Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Participants will need a wide range of employment interventions to support them in their journey towards work and the key worker will support them in taking steps to employment, for example, work experience, volunteering opportunities and supported internships</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where a Participant prefers, self-employment can be pursued</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Participants will have, as a minimum, experience in a work environment of 16 hours (unpaid) during their period of up to 456 days’ pre-work support</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> In-Work Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When the Participant has been successful in gaining employment, a minimum of 182 days of support will be given to help them remain in work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Key Worker will provide practical help and support, such as journey planning, settling in with the new employer, offer weekly face to face meetings and advocacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where required, reasonable adjustments and Access to Work will be pursued to help the Participant sustain employment</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>The IPES journey is not linear. Participants can move back and forth across the stages, depending on where they are at any given time on their journey.</p>
</div>

<h2>Length of Support</h2>

<p>1.26. The maximum time on provision is 639 days, consisting of up to 456 days (15 months) Pre-Work Support and a minimum of 182 days (6 months) In-Work Support (<abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr>), with day 639 being for Participants who work night shifts (where their shift starts on day 638 and ends on day 639). Once a participant starts on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision, they remain on provision until they become a Completer or Early Completer.  Where a Participant enters employment (or self-employment) before day 456, they move from Pre-Work Support to <abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr>. The Participant continues in <abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr> until they complete the provision (see paragraph 8.03). If a Participant’s employment (or self-employment) ends before day 456, the Participant moves back into Pre-Work Support.</p>

<p>1.27. Where a Participant has received 456 days of support (consisting of Pre-Work Support, or both Pre-Work Support and <abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr>) provision can be extended to allow for a maximum of 639 days of support, provided that a Participant is receiving <abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr> on day 457 onwards. The period from day 457 is known as the “Extension Period”.</p>

<p>1.28. Details of when extension and exit activity is appropriate can be found within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap6">Chapter 6</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap8">chapter 8</a> of this guidance.</p>

<h2>Programme Duration</h2>

<p>1.29. Referrals will take place between the Service Start Date and the Referral End Date, with up to four (4) years of referrals, dependent upon when the Call-Off Service Start Date occurs. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will have an option to extend referrals for up to two years beyond the original Referral End Date.</p>

<p>1.30. Service delivery, including In-Work Support, will continue for a maximum of 639 days after the last start on provision.</p>

<h2>Document Retention</h2>

<p>1.31. Providers must maintain complete and accurate documents and records in relation to the provision of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> for the period of their contract. The Contract Terms &amp; Conditions will set out the relevant Contract periods and the Records Retention End Date.</p>

<p>1.32. When considering key dates for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision, Providers should always refer to their Contract Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

<h2>Signposting Organisations (<abbr title="Signposting Organisations">SOs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1.33. In order to make the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision accessible to all eligible individuals, including those who are not regular customers of the Jobcentre, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>-approved Signposting Organisations will be able to signpost to the Jobcentre those individuals that they think will benefit from <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>.</p>

<p>1.34. It has been agreed that Providers can be Signposting Organisations in their own Contract Package Areas (<abbr title="Contract Package Areas">CPAs</abbr>), should they choose to. Providers should contact their Jobcentre Plus Local Partnership Manager within their <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> to discuss the process for registering.</p>

<h2>Marketing the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision</h2>

<p>1.35. <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Providers can decide the best way to promote <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> services and can use their own branding on marketing materials, however ‘Intensive Personalised Employment Support’ should appear prominently within all public facing materials. The following sets out acceptable <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> naming conventions:</p>
