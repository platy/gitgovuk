<h2>Target groups</h2>

<p>2.01	Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) is a voluntary provision aimed specifically at disabled people, as defined under the Equality Act 2010, with complex barriers to employment for which other support such as the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) is unsuitable, and who are more than 12 months away from employment without support.</p>

<p>2.02	Complex barriers to work means that the Participant will have multiple barriers which may be a combination of personal and work related barriers which impact on their readiness to be able to get into and remain in work. This may be an impairment or condition which significantly increases their barrier to work, for example, a learning disability or barriers such as homelessness, intra family violence, substance misuse and low self-esteem. Participants must meet the eligibility criteria, as set out below.</p>

<p>2.03	The objective of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> is to address barriers to employment and provide Participants with the employability skills they need to either engage with, or move into, employment following participation in the programme.</p>

<p>2.04	Potential Participants for the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> programme do not have to be Jobcentre customers or be in receipt of any specific welfare benefit in order to participate. Likewise, there is no requirement to have been on welfare benefits for a specific duration in order to be eligible.</p>

<p>2.05	Signposting Organisations will be approved by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to identify potentially eligible individuals for signposting to the Jobcentre for onward referral to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> if they think the provision is suitable for the potential Participant.</p>

<p>2.06	It is the responsibility of the Jobcentre to assess the Participant, confirm their eligibility and suitability for the provision overall, and gain their agreement to attend this voluntary provision.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Providers should note that the final decision regarding whether a Participant is eligible or suitable for referral to the IPES provision will remain with the Jobcentre.</p>
</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>2.07	To be eligible for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, potential Participants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a disability or disabilities as defined in the Equality Act 2010;</li>
  <li>have the right to reside in the United Kingdom;</li>
  <li>have the right to work in the United Kingdom;</li>
  <li>reside in England or Wales;</li>
  <li>not be in any form of paid employment;</li>
  <li>be of working age (16 to State Pension age);</li>
  <li>not be currently participating in other Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Contracted Employment provision.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> in England and Wales, “working age” is defined as starting from 16 years of age. However, in England 16 to 17 year olds who are not in work are required to stay in education or training, so whilst 16-17 year olds can access <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> in Wales, in England they cannot. 18 year-olds can apply if they are both eligible and suitable for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> ‘not be in any form of paid employment’, as stated at the fifth bullet above, also applies to self-employment. Potential participants should not be in any form of employment, i.e., not employed, self-employed or on a zero-hours contract, when a referral to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> is made</p>

<h2>Suitability</h2>

<p>2.08	Suitable Participants for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>want to work and to volunteer for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>;</li>
  <li>have complex barriers to work;</li>
  <li>be more than a year from employment in the labour market, without the support of this programme;</li>
  <li>require more intensive support to transition into work and require intensive <abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr>, beyond that offered by other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision.</li>
</ul>

<p>2.09	Examples of the characteristics of this cohort could include the following (note: This list is not exhaustive):</p>
