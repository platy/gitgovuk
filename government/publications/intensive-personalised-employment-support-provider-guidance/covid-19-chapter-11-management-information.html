<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>11.01. Along with the standard MI information recorded through the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT System (PRaP), you must send a monthly clerical return that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use to inform analyses and reports to evaluate <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision and performance.</p>

<h2>Product Characteristics</h2>

<p>11.02. The Monthly Activities Report (<abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr>) is the product that you will use to record <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> activities and resources on a monthly basis, at individual level, or as aggregated statistics. Format and content of this product has been chosen to make the information collected through the <abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr> complementary and compatible with other data held by or available to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>11.03. The copies of the <abbr title="Monthly Activities Reports">MARs</abbr> that you send into <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be held for up to three months and then cancelled.</p>

<p>11.04.  The <abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr> is a product developed by the analysts of the Data, Analytics and Controls Division of the Contracted Health and Employment Services (<abbr title="Contracted Health and Employment Services">CHES</abbr>) Directorate, and agreed with a group of stakeholders within the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and with each provider delivering <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>.</p>

<h2>The Monthly Activities Report (<abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr>) Spreadsheet</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr> is released as an excel file and contains the following spreadsheets (tabs):</p>

<p>11.05. Instructions – a summary of all the information reported in this User Guide.</p>

<p>11.06. Cover – a command button that user has to press in order to prepare the file to record the monthly updates.</p>

<p>11.07.	Keyworker – information about the Keyworkers (<abbr title="Keyworkers">KW</abbr>) delivering <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>. The user will ensure that all information in this tab is updated on a monthly basis. The information recorded in the <abbr title="Keyworkers">KW</abbr> tab will help to evaluate the impact of the one-to-one relationship with the dedicated <abbr title="Keyworkers">KW</abbr>. This section records the <abbr title="Full time employment">FTE</abbr> of each keyworker and main area of intervention/expertise. It also tracks the status of each <abbr title="Keyworkers">KW</abbr> to validate the information relative to each operator recorded in the Participants tab.</p>

<p>11.08.	Participants – information at individual level about each participant’s experience on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>. It is divided in 4 sections and participants should be entered in this spreadsheet when a referral number is available and only if they started <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Section A – Participants Details records information to map <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> participants into the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> IT system. This section also records the stage of provision for each <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> customer, enabling tracking the participant through an active (pre-work support or in-work support) or inactive (disengagement or completion) phases; how quickly they progress through provision; and how often the journey is interrupted (disengagement).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section B – Contacts with dedicated keyworker (<abbr title="dedicated keyworker">dKW</abbr>) records information about the relationship between participant and the dedicated <abbr title="Keyworkers">KW</abbr>. This section records the number of face to face meetings that participant has to review, plan and participate in activities and interventions, separately with the <abbr title="dedicated keyworker">dKW</abbr> and with any other operator (internal or external to the Provider). Providers are also asked to report the date of the Case Conference, when it takes place in the reporting month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section C – Number of Interventions to help individual’s specific needs. This section is designed to collect information about the personalised support that each participant receives monthly. It contains 3 main aspects of participant’s life that might require specialist support: work; health; and financial, plus a fourth generic category in which the user should record the number of interventions and the type of intervention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section D records the number of hours that each participant has spent monthly as unpaid work experience during Pre-work support and the number of interventions delivered to participant’s employer during the in-work support phase. These are 2 requirements of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> offer, but the extent of this support may vary between participants, therefore, this section aims to record information to quantify their impact on Participant’s future outcomes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11.09. Monthly Performance Return (<abbr title="Monthly Performance Return">MPR</abbr>) – information about the provider’s compliance with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>) 4 - 97% of Action Plans agreed and signed by both the Contractor and Participant on the day of the initial meeting, must be developed over the next 20 Working Days after the initial meeting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> 8 - Providers must complete an <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report and <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Exit Activity Plan for 100% of participants where required.  The reports must be produced within 10 working days of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision ending.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> 10 - Warm Handback Case Conference with the Jobcentre must be arranged and facilitated by the Contractor for 100% of Participants, where required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>11.10.	For all the 3 CSSs, the user needs to report the total number of eligible cases and the number of cases where the <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> requirement was met.</p>

<h2>Instructions for Completion</h2>

<p>11.11.	The <abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr> must be completed by the 3rd working day of each month.</p>

<p>11.12.	Full user guidance, including access to the <abbr title="Monthly Activities Report">MAR</abbr>, is available to providers via JAGGAER.</p>

<p>11.13.	In the event of any concerns, please contact your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager.</p>
