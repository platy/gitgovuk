<h3>Data Protection Legislation and Data Sharing</h3>

<p>You must ensure that you follow the requirements around Data Protection Legislation and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) taking into account your Contract Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

<p>In relation to the sharing of data, providers should also adhere to all requirements as laid out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/909054/generic-guidance-chapter-8.pdf" rel="external">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Information Security</a>.</p>

<h2>Referral Process</h2>

<p>This chapter sets out the end-to-end referral process that you will need to follow in order to start a Participant on the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. Some of the activities, for example, completing the Action Plan, will be covered in more detail in subsequent chapters of this Guidance.</p>

<h2>Jobcentre Referral to Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) provision</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>3.01	The Jobcentre Work Coach is responsible for determining a potential Participant’s eligibility and suitability for the Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) provision</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Providers are not permitted to refer potential Participants directly to the IPES provision and should note that the final decision regarding whether a potential Participant is eligible or suitable for referral to the IPES provision will remain with the Jobcentre.</p>
</div>

<p>3.02	The majority of referrals will be made electronically via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, except in a small number of cases where the Participant has been given Special Customer Record (<abbr title="special customer record">SCR</abbr>) status.</p>

<h2>Signposting Organisations (<abbr title="Signposting Organisations">SOs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>3.03	In order to make the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision accessible to all eligible individuals, including those who are not regular customers of the Jobcentre, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approved Signposting Organisations will be able to signpost to the Jobcentre those individuals that they think will benefit from <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: It has been agreed that Providers can be Signposting Organisations in their own Contract Package Area’s (CPAs), should they choose to. Providers should contact their Jobcentre Plus Local Partnership Manager within their CPA to discuss the process for registering, and to ensure that their own organisation is added to the approved list of Signposting Organisations.</p>
</div>

<p>3.04	Providers can market the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision to these <abbr title="Signposting Organisations">SOs</abbr>, who will then be able to identify potential Participants for the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. The <abbr title="Signposting Organisation">SO</abbr> will establish eligibility and suitability (using the same eligibility and suitability criteria as used by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>), then refer to the Jobcentre using template IPESSO1.</p>

<p>3.05	The Work Coach will be notified of the signposted referral (through an established Jobcentre process) and will contact the potential Participant to arrange an interview in order to confirm eligibility and suitability for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. Once confirmed, they will follow the process detailed below.</p>

<p>3.06	For further information on Signposting Organisations, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap5">Chapter 5</a> of this Guidance.</p>

<p>3.07	Further information for Signposting Organisations on how to signpost to the Jobcentre will be available through <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Local Partnership Managers and / or local Jobcentre contacts.</p>

<h2>Initial Engagement Activity</h2>

<p>3.08	The Work Coach will assess the potential Participant, confirm their overall eligibility and suitability for the provision, and check that they agree to engage in this voluntary provision.</p>

<h2>The Warm Handover Process</h2>

<p>3.09	The Warm Handover meeting will enable the sharing of appropriate potential Participant information with you, the provider, to assist you in offering an individualised service to Participants.</p>

<p>3.10	The Work Coach will arrange the Warm Handover meeting, which will be held via a 3-way conference call between the potential Participant, Work Coach and your representative, where telephony and Jobcentre room availability allow. Otherwise, the standard telephony available to the Work Coach will be utilised.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> whilst this is a three-way conversation, there may be occasions when a third-party advocate, or translator, is also present on the call.</p>

<p>3.11	When the Work Coach has confirmed that the potential Participant is eligible and suitable, the potential Participant will attend the Jobcentre where the Work Coach will confirm that they still want to volunteer for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>. 
At this point, the Work Coach will call you to undertake the Warm Handover meeting.</p>

<p>3.12	The Warm Handover meeting will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable the Work Coach to introduce the potential Participant to you, the provider;</li>
  <li>enable the potential Participant to have an initial conversation with your representative, where you will engage with them and explain what to expect whilst on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, taking into account their disability, barriers to work, aspirations and skills, and;</li>
  <li>address any issues or concerns that the potential Participant may have, for example, accessibility issues or any additional support they may require.</li>
  <li>enable you to arrange the initial face-to-face meeting’</li>
</ul>

<p>3.13	As best practice, the Work Coach should inform you of the date and time of the Warm Handover meeting (which has been agreed with the potential Participant), and of any support arrangements that may need to be put in place.</p>

<p>3.14	The Work Coach may also contact you in advance of the Warm Handover to make you aware of any specific support requirements the potential Participant may have that should be considered when taking the call, for example, any challenging personal or social issues, translation or interpreting problems, or difficulties with comprehending the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> offer. This  may include pre-warning where there are MAPPA restrictions in place.</p>

<h2>Warm Handover Action</h2>

<p>3.15	You will be expected to have a dedicated resource, with full knowledge of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> offer, ready and available to take the call and to speak to the potential Participant in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actively promote the benefits of the programme</li>
  <li>reassure the potential Participant and provide practical information as to travel, meeting locations, etc. including offering the use of outreach if their journey is considered excessive – see para 3.44 below</li>
  <li>understand any accessibility issues they may have in order to arrange access or interpreters, and to ensure they are directed to the most suitable Key Worker</li>
  <li>gather sufficient personal information to arrange the initial face-to-face meeting, agreeing a date, time and location</li>
  <li>take the referring Work Coach’s phone number and email address (or that of the Disability Employment Adviser (<abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr>), if appropriate)</li>
  <li>check that the potential Participant is not in any form of employment including zero-hour contracts. Further information where a potential Participant finds work or receives a job offer between referral and the Initial Meeting can be found at 3.64 below</li>
</ul>

<p>3.16	Circumstances may occur where it is not possible for the potential Participant to engage with the Warm Handover meeting due to restrictions caused, for example, by their disability. These should be in exceptional circumstances only and the Jobcentre will still generate a referral to the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Provider using <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> and documenting the reasons for this action. Where this occurs, providers must supply the potential Participant with the time, date and location for the first Initial Provider meeting, using the appropriate methods available.</p>

<p>3.17	The Policy intent for Warm Handovers is that they should be conducted over the phone as this is generally the quickest and most efficient method for all involved.
However, there may be occasions when your representative, the Work Coach and the potential Participant are in the Jobcentre at the same time and due to the potential Participant’s disability, it may be more beneficial to undertake the Warm Handover face-to-face.</p>

<p>3.18	The use of face-to-face Warm Handovers is acceptable, provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Warm Handover takes place in the Jobcentre</li>
  <li>your representative, the potential Participant and the Work Coach agree that it is feasible, and</li>
  <li>there is appropriate space in the Jobcentre for the meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>3.19	Face-to-face Warm Handovers should be treated as an exceptional circumstance to meet the needs of the individual only, and not become a usual occurrence.</p>

<h2>Warm Handover Next steps</h2>

<p>3.20	Once the Warm Handover meeting is complete, and if the potential Participant agrees to start <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, the Work Coach will generate a referral to the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision using <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.21	During the period from the Warm Handover to the initial meeting, you must maintain contact with the potential Participant to ensure on-going engagement. This will allow any changes to the potential Participant’s circumstances to be taken into account, for example, where a potential Participant receives an offer of work, or has changes to their travel arrangements and/or support needs.</p>

<h2>Acknowledging the Referral</h2>

<p>3.22	You must acknowledge a referral on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> by accepting or rejecting the referral within 2 working days of receipt of the referral (the day of the receipt of the referral is deemed as day 1).</p>

<p>3.23	This will be a Customer Service Standard against which your performance will be measured.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Failure to acknowledge the referral will mean that you will be unable to subsequently accept a referral, or record a start date, and will impact on your ability to receive any resulting payments.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You must not start working with the potential Participant before the referral to IPES has been made and acknowledged in PRaP.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Referral not received</h3>

<p>3.24	If, following the Warm Handover with the potential Participant, you have not received the expected referral, and if <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has not notified providers of any known technical issues affecting <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, then you must first check with the Jobcentre that the referral has been made.
If the referral has not been made, this can then be rectified by the Jobcentre.</p>

<h3>Potential Participant does not wish to continue with the referral to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>
</h3>

<p>3.25	If, following the Warm Handover, the potential Participant advises their Work Coach that they do not wish to continue with the referral to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, then the Work Coach should advise you of this and the referral to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> should not be made.</p>

<p>3.26	If the referral has already been made, the Work Coach should notify you that the Participant no longer wishes to participate on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>. You should record the outcome on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> as Did Not Attend</p>

<p>3.27	If the referral has been made and is visible in PRAP, then you should report this to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> (<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team) and they can investigate and ensure a fix is deployed.</p>

<h2>Starting on Provision</h2>

<h3>The Start Date</h3>

<p>3.28	For <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, the Start is the point at which the individual commences participation in the programme and will be the date that the Participant attends their Initial Meeting with you.</p>

<p>3.29	The Start Date is day one of the 456-day period where you start to work with the Participant.</p>

<p>3.30	You must hold the Initial Meeting with the Participant within 15 working days from the date the referral was made in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.31	You must also record the start date in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, or the relevant “Did Not Start” or “Did Not Attend” outcomes, within 15 working days from the date the referral was made in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>This may be recorded retrospectively if you are entering the start date after the Initial Meeting was conducted. Evidence of the start date should be retained in the form of initial action planning activity.</p>

<p>3.32	The paragraphs above form a single Customer Service Standard against which your performance will be measured.</p>

<p>3.33	Further details on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> action can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap10">Chapter 10</a> of this guidance and in the relevant <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> user guidance that will be issued to you in a separate document.</p>

<h2>Initial Meeting with the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Participant</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Living with COVID</h3>

<p>The expectation for IPES is that the Initial Meeting between the potential participant and Key Worker should be face-to-face. With Government COVID-19 restrictions now removed, this face-to-face activity should resume, with digital Meetings held only by exception.</p>

<p>Where meetings are held digitally, the reason for not holding the meeting face-to-face must be clearly recorded on the Participant records, in anticipation of Performance Compliance Officers (PCO) checks.</p>
</div>

<p>3.34	The initial meeting is where you continue to build the relationship with the Participant that started with the Warm Handover meeting.  Caseload sizes must allow Key Workers sufficient time to properly deliver the services and appropriate level of support, to each Participant, as agreed in their Action Plan. This will allow the Key Worker to establish a relationship with the Participant built on trust, as well as allow them to understand the Participant’s aspirations and complex barriers, and identify and develop the Participant’s support network.</p>

<p>3.35	There is a requirement for the Participant to have a consistent Key Worker throughout their time on provision, including throughout the In-Work Support (<abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr>) phase (further information relating to <abbr title="In-Work Support">IWS</abbr> is detailed in Chapter 6 of this Provider Guidance).</p>

<p>3.36	The Initial Meeting should be held by the Participant’s dedicated Key Worker. However, if in exceptional circumstances this is not possible, then there must be a separate introductory meeting with the Key Worker, which  should be face-to-face, with digital meetings held by exception.</p>

<p>3.37	At the initial meeting, you must check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Participant’s ID</li>
  <li>that the Participant is not in any form of employment, including zero-hour contracts, and</li>
  <li>if the Participant is expecting a final payment from any previous employer, for example Payment in Lieu of Notice (<abbr title="Payment in Lieu of Notice">PILON</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Identity Checks</h3>

<p>3.38	You should ensure that the ID and employment checks are recorded on the Participant’s record as they will be subject to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Audit and Performance Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr>) checking.</p>

<p>3.39	You must also ensure that in all communications with Participants, both at the Initial Meeting and through the Participant’s journey, you are satisfied you are engaging with the correct person.</p>

<p>3.40	To do this, you may decide to ask them to state a combination of their personal information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>National Insurance number</li>
  <li>other information, such as details that were included within the original referral from the jobcentre</li>
  <li>details you hold in your records</li>
</ul>

<p>3.41	Other means of identification, such as a passport, driving licence, or utility bill may be provided. These should be recorded as seen and the reference/serial number of these documents noted but copies do not need to be retained.</p>

<p>3.42	Other means of identification, for example, utility bills or Mobile phone bills could also be used as evidence and a copy kept for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Audit and <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr> checking, where required.</p>

<h3>Reminding Participant of the length of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision</h3>

<p>3.43	During the Initial Meeting, you should remind the Participant that their length of time on provision can consist of 15 months Pre-Work Support, and a minimum of 6 months In-Work Support, where appropriate. Participants should be reminded that <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> has been designed to be a long-term commitment to allow you, the provider, to provide the intensity of support needed to move the Participants into, or nearer to, employment, or self-employment.</p>

<p>3.44	If at this stage, and before signing the Action Plan, the Participant feels unable to make such a long-term commitment and changes their mind about starting <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, you should record a Did Not Start (“<abbr title="did not start">DNS</abbr>”) in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr></p>

<h3>Participant Accessibility</h3>

<p>3.45	You are required to deliver the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision across the entire <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> via a range of engagement methods that may include but is not limited to fixed delivery premises and outreach services (on a permanent and/or temporary basis). To ensure that <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> is accessible to all Participants, all premises must be easily accessible to Participants, including those using public transport. Premises must meet all legal requirements and provide facilities commensurate with the requirements of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Call-Off Specification, and be compliant with the Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>3.46	Providers will be required to ensure that if Participants have to travel to meetings at the Provider’s premises, they can do so by public transport and such travel will take no longer than 90 minutes in each direction, by a route and means appropriate to their circumstances. Where a Participant’s health condition limits their ability to travel, the Provider is expected to make appropriate arrangements to meet the Participant, for example at outreach locations.</p>

<h2>Travel Costs</h2>

<p>3.47	You are responsible for funding the Participant’s travel costs to attend <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision, including all disability-related travel costs.</p>

<p>3.48	For further information on travel expenses, and childcare/ caring responsibilities, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap5">Chapter 5</a> of this guidance.</p>

<h2>Needs Assessment</h2>

<p>3.49	At the Initial Meeting with a Participant, you must commence a detailed needs assessment for each Participant to establish their requirements and identify any barriers to employment or to accessing support services.</p>

<p>3.50	This assessment will help to inform the activities to be detailed in the Action Plan and should determine elements such as work-related independence skills (for example, mobility and required use of assistive technology).</p>

<p>3.51	More detailed information on Needs Assessment can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap4">Chapter 4</a>, of this guidance.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan</h2>

<p>3.52	At the same Initial Meeting, you must start an <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan. A first draft of the Action Plan must be created and signed by the Participant and the Provider on the day of the Initial Meeting. This Action Plan will be developed over the next 20 working days after the Initial Meeting and will be based on the Participant’s needs assessment.</p>

<p>3.53	It is accepted that full completion of the Action Plan is not likely to happen at the Initial Meeting due to the complexity of the Participant’s disabilities and barriers to employment.</p>

<p>3.54	As a minimum, at the Initial Meeting, you should agree with the Participant the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date and time of the next meeting, or contact</li>
  <li>the location of the next meeting</li>
  <li>the Participant’s preferred method of communication</li>
  <li>any action to take in preparation for the next meeting, for example, a list of the Participants’ support network or other action to be agreed</li>
  <li>any further adjustments or support required, and</li>
  <li>an offer of weekly support</li>
</ul>

<p>3.55	You must ensure that the Action Plan started has been signed and dated by both the Participant, and you as the Provider, and issue them with a copy of the Action Plan. A copy must also be retained by you, as it forms part of the evidence of a Start on provision.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Any Action Plan which does not contain both the Participant’s signature and the Provider’s signature will not be valid for DWP audit/ PCO checks.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Living with COVID</h3>

<h4>Collecting IPES signatures</h4>

<p>With Government Covid-19 restrictions ended, the easements allowed as part of the Covid-19 support for providers which included the annotation, “due to COVID-19”, should no longer be used and the participant should sign documents appropriately.</p>

<p>IPES is not prescriptive about how those required signatures are collected. However, provision has been made which allows Providers the option to use one (or more) robust digital alternatives to obtain and store a Participant’s signature as part of the evidence of activities undertaken, where a face-to-face appointment is not possible or where the collection of a wet signature is not practicable, for example, at an Outreach location.</p>

<p>Where Digital processes are used, as set out in the letter from DWP on 13 July 2022, Providers must ensure that these processes are suitably robust and will allow the storing of Participant signatures as evidence of any key activities. Signatures will continue to be monitored as part of the Performance Compliance Officers Assurance Checking Regime.</p>

<p>Providers must provide a solution to be applied in the event of the digital alternative not being available at a particular moment in time, and where a wet signature cannot be obtained.</p>
</div>

<p>3.56	A fully agreed Action Plan must be in place within 20 workings days of the start date. This will be a Customer Service Standard against which you will be measured.</p>

<p>3.57	Further information on action planning requirements can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intensive-personalised-employment-support-provider-guidance#chap4">Chapter 4</a> of this guidance.</p>

<h3>Induction pack</h3>

<p>3.58	At the Initial Meeting, you should ensure that you issue the Participant with an Induction pack, which should be signed for by the Participant.</p>

<p>3.59 This should include as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and safety instructions</li>
  <li>your complaints procedure</li>
  <li>your responsibilities under the Data Protection Act (DPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) *</li>
  <li>information on travel and expenses (including a signed declaration to show that this has been offered)</li>
  <li>information on other expenses, including child care</li>
  <li>map(s)</li>
  <li>location and contact details</li>
  <li>general expectations around behaviour and attendance</li>
  <li>any other information relevant to the Participant</li>
</ul>

<p>3.60	You must keep the Action Plan, its revision history and all other relevant documentation stored safely and securely, and in line with Data Protection and <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> principles.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> Action and Recording the Correct outcome.</h3>

<p>3.61	<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision has been designed on the principle that Participants are deemed to have started the programme on attending their Initial Meeting. There are therefore limited reasons why a Participant may not start <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>.</p>

<p>For all the scenarios detailed below, evidence must be collected to demonstrate why the Participant has not started <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>. The evidence must be made available to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s request.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note: For clarity, should a Participant fail to attend the Initial Meeting with you, the Provider, then the outcome must be recorded as a Did Not Attend (“DNA”). If the Participant attends the Initial Meeting but does not start for any of the reasons detailed below, then the outcome must be recorded as a Did Not Start (“DNS”). Please refer to the tables at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex3-1">Annex 3.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex3-2">Annex 3.2</a> for relevant PRaP action.</p>
</div>

<h2>Potential scenarios</h2>

<h3>Participant notifies the Provider that they are unable to attend the Initial Meeting</h3>

<p>3.62	Should a Participant contact you to say that they are unable to attend the Initial Meeting, for example, due to a hospital appointment, or where this is identified through on-going engagement with the Participant (as set out in paragraph 3.21), you should make arrangements to reschedule the meeting in line with CSS2 (Providers to hold the Initial Meeting within 15 days of the referral being made).</p>

<p>3.63	Should a Participant refuse to attend the initial meeting, you must address their concerns regarding attendance on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. For example, <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Participants may experience concerns around travel, concerns about meeting new people, or travelling to new environments, and you should make every attempt to address these concerns. Where possible, you should encourage the Participant to attend the scheduled meeting to discuss their concerns face-to-face or reschedule if that is more convenient. If the Participant still refuses to attend, or if you have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact them and to address their concerns, you must record a referral outcome of Did Not Attend ‘<abbr title="did not attend">DNA</abbr>’ in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr></p>

<p>3.64	Should the Participant refuse to reschedule their Initial Meeting, and if you have made multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact them and to address their concerns, you must record a referral outcome of Did Not Attend ‘<abbr title="did not attend">DNA</abbr>’ in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Participant reports that they are unable to commence <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision (for example due to starting work/receiving a job offer/hospitalisation)</h3>

<p>3.65	Where between referral and start, the Participant reports that they are unable to commence <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision due to starting work, receiving a job offer, being hospitalised or where there is a deterioration in health, then they should not commence on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. In these situations, you should consider taking the following appropriate action.</p>

<p>3.66 If, between Referral and the Initial Meeting, a Participant informs you that they have received a job offer or started work, or are going into hospital imminently, you should refer the Participant back to the Jobcentre and record a Did Not Attend (“<abbr title="did not attend">DNA</abbr>”) in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.67	If a Participant attends the initial meeting but advises you that they are due to start work or have received a job offer or are going into hospital imminently, you should record a Did Not Start (“<abbr title="did not start">DNS</abbr>”) in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.68 If, after recording a start date, a Participant informs you that they have received a job offer or have started work or are going into hospital imminently, you must notify the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy team with the circumstances and attach a completed PRaP14. You should do this by emailing the inbox <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ipes.providerenquiries@dwp.gov.uk">ipes.providerenquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>3.69	On receipt of your email and completed PRaP14, the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy team will consider the circumstances and then advise you of the outcome of their investigations. If the circumstances are accepted, <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy team will send the completed PRaP14 to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> to be actioned.</p>

<h2>Participant fails to attend the initial meeting</h2>

<p>3.70	If the Participant fails to attend the Initial Meeting you must make multiple attempts to contact them. If you are unable to contact the Participant you must record a ‘Did Not Attend’ in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, which should be input to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> within 15 working days of the date the referral was made, in line with CSS2.</p>

<h3>Hospitalisation</h3>

<p>3.71	 If the Participant expects to be hospitalised for a short period, they may still require <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision and providers should still engage with the Participant and rearrange their Initial Meeting for an appropriate future date.</p>

<p>3.72	If the Participant is likely to be hospitalised for the duration of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> programme, <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> action will need to be undertaken to record the outcome, dependent on whether or not they attend the Initial Meeting, and as per the required actions at 3.65 - 3.67 above.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> action after 60 days</h3>

<p>3.73	After 60 calendar days of the referral from the Jobcentre, the Participant’s record will automatically show as a Did Not Attend in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, unless you have, prior to the 60th day, input the Participant’s start date or the relevant outcome Did Not Attend (<abbr title="did not attend">DNA</abbr>)/Did Not Start (<abbr title="did not start">DNS</abbr>). 
If this occurs the individual will not be a Participant on the Programme unless subsequently the Jobcentre makes a new referral for that Participant which results in a start. Any Participant not recorded as a Start within 60 calendar days should be referred back to the Jobcentre.</p>

<h3>Participant referred in error</h3>

<p>3.74	 Where you identify that a referral may have been made in error, for example, where the Participant is already on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> provision, you must notify the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy team with the circumstances, by emailing the inbox: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ipes.providerenquiries@dwp.gov.uk">ipes.providerenquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a>. 
The Policy team will investigate and advise you of the required action to take.</p>

<h2>Re-Referrals</h2>

<p>3.75	In exceptional cases, the Participant can be considered for Re-Referral, subject to the Work Coach’s re-assessment on whether a Re-Referral is the most suitable option for the Participant at that time. Participants who have been unable to complete their <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision may be re-referred back to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> in the future. For example, this may be appropriate where a Participant’s journey is disrupted due to a long hospital stay and they have not been able to participate for the full provision duration.</p>

<p>3.76	Re-Referrals will not be made automatically but considered on a ‘case by case’ basis with due consideration for the Participant and their circumstances. Work Coaches will consider all other available provision before making the decision to re-refer the Participant back to <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision. If a Participant has been in work whilst on provision it is likely that other provision would be more suitable for their needs as they are closer to the labour market.</p>

<p>3.77	All the following criteria must also be met</p>

<ul>
  <li>participant still meets the eligibility /suitability criteria</li>
  <li>an employment or self-employment outcome payment must not have been paid or due from previous participation on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>
</li>
  <li>638 calendar days must have lapsed since the Participant previously started <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision (639 calendar days for Participants working night shifts)</li>
  <li>participant has not been re-referred previously</li>
</ul>

<p>3.78	Where the Work Coach has assessed that a Re-Referral to the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision is the most suitable option for the Participant, and that the criteria detailed above have been met, the Work Coach will make the Re-Referral on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> and you will need to acknowledge the Re-Referral as detailed above.</p>

<p>3.79	<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision for Participants who have been re-referred will restart from day one.</p>

<h2>Participant contact</h2>

<p>3.80	For <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, Participants must be offered weekly face-to-face contact plus any additional contact as required. As a minimum, face-to-face meetings must take place every four weeks throughout the full time on the programme, however, you are expected to maintain the intensity of support required, with more frequent interventions available when required by individual Participants. This level of contact should be maintained as the Participant transitions into work. Evidence checks to ensure that providers are adhering to delivery models set out in their contract will be performed regularly by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff including (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCOs</abbr>).</p>

<p>3.81	All activity undertaken with the Participant must be recorded on the Participant’s Action Plan. This includes all contact between the Provider and the Participant, and all of the Provider’s attempts to contact the Participant.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>As IPES is an individualised provision, you will need to agree with the Participant the level and type of contact (in line with the minimum number of face-to-face meetings) that is most appropriate to them, and this should be recorded on the Action Plan.</p>
</div>

<h2>MAPPA and Special Customer Records</h2>

<p>3.82  Please refer to Chapter 2 ‘Delivering <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provision’ in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/871436/generic-guidance-chapter-2.pdf" rel="external">further information on the procedure for MAPPA and <abbr title="special customer record">SCR</abbr> cases</a>.</p>
