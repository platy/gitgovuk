<p>1.01	It is expected that providers will be producing material to market the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision to, amongst others, stakeholders, potential participants, Signposting Organisations, the Jobcentre, etc.</p>

<p>1.02	You should decide the best way to promote <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> services and use your own branding on marketing materials. However, ‘Intensive Personalised Employment Support’ should appear prominently on all customer-focused materials.</p>

<p>1.03	<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> does not have its own logo or brand identity and you are not expected to create an identity for it.</p>

<p>1.04	You should ensure that you follow the acceptable <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> naming conventions detailed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Intensive Personalised Employment Support’ name cannot be used merely as a page footer but must be prominently placed on the page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Intensive Personalised Employment Support’ name can appear alongside the Provider branding within a logo but must be prominently displayed.  To clarify, you are not expected to create a logo encompassing both your own logo and the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> name, but are allowed to have them adjacent on your marketing material.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ‘Intensive Personalised Employment Support’ must be written in full in the title. Use of the ’<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>’ acronym is not allowed in the title but may be used in the body of the product</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>1.05	Should you need any advice or guidance on the naming conventions, the use of the correct <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> logo, or to ensure that the material accurately reflects the intention of the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision, you may contact the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy Manager. However, the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy Manager will provide impartial advice which is in no way an endorsement of the content and full responsibility lies with you, the provider, to ensure that material is fully compliant.</p>

<p>1.06	At no point should you request Jobcentre staff to quality assure your <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> marketing material. Any requests for advice and guidance on content should be sent to the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Policy Manager at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ipes.providerenquiries@dwp.gov.uk">ipes.providerenquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>1.07	For information on the correct <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> logos to use, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504015/pg-chapter-9.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance - Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p>1.08	To access the logos, or for information, you will be required to log in to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Communications Centre. You should click on ‘I work with the Department for Work and Pensions as a framework provider or sub-contractor’ – ‘Using Logos’. If you have not already registered with this site, it is advisable to do so.</p>
