<h2>Data Protection Legislation and Data Sharing</h2>

<p>You must ensure that you follow the requirements around Data Protection Legislation and General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) taking into account your Contract Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

<p>In relation to the sharing of data, providers should also adhere to all requirements as laid out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Information Security</a>.</p>

<h2>Case Conferencing</h2>

<p>Providers should be aware that as the Case Conference process is new to contracted provision, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor its usage throughout the lifetime of the programme. Once <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has an evidence base, Case Conferences will be reviewed and the way forward discussed with providers.</p>

<p>Future discussions may include the introduction of specific Customer Service Standards, subject to negotiations with providers.</p>

<h2>Case Conferencing Overview</h2>

<p>13.01.	Case conferencing is an integral part of the Intensive Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>) provision. The purpose of the Case Conference is to maintain the relationship between the Participant, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and you, the Provider, to help ensure the Participant’s needs are being met through the Action Plan. It will also help to ensure that Participants are receiving the intensity of support required to move them closer to, and into, sustained employment, and to ensure that the Participant has a positive and meaningful experience whilst on provision</p>

<p>13.02.	Case Conferences give Participants the opportunity to review their needs, bringing together the advice and support of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the provider. They are about discussing the progress the Participant is making, the skills they are obtaining and how their barriers to employment are being reduced.</p>

<p>13.03.	There is the opportunity, if the provider deems it is appropriate, for Case Conferences to be prefaced by a pre-Case Conference discussion between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the provider to set the scene for the Case Conference. The Participant will not attend this meeting.</p>

<p>13.04.	Case Conferences will be carried out on an individual basis and the expectation is that they should be face-to-face in Jobcentre premises. If a face to face meeting is not possible, for example, because the Participant cannot attend the Jobcentre in person, it should be delivered by tele-conference, or digitally.</p>

<p>13.05.	For most cases, Case Conferencing activity will consist of 20 minutes for the pre-Case Conference, if required, (to be held at least a week before the scheduled Case Conference) and 40 minutes for the Case Conference. Where the pre-Case Conference is not required, then the full one hour of Jobcentre time may be utilised for the case conference.</p>

<p>13.06.	All Case Conferences should be arranged and the discussion led by you, the provider.</p>

<p>13.07.	You must meet all the costs incurred by the Participant, for example, travel expenses, or providing an interpreter.</p>

<p>13.08.	Participants should have three Case Conferences across the Pre-Work Support period (456 days):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the initial Case Conference, which takes place following development of the Participants’ <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan, and maintains momentum when the relationship between the Participant and the provider has been established</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the second Case Conference, to review progress achieved and encourage participation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the third or final Case Conference, which will be held at 15 months, and must include the next steps towards securing employment. This third Case Conference may also constitute the Warm Handback to Jobcentre Plus, where required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>13.09.	The timing of each Case Conference will be for you to decide, adding flexibility to suit the needs of the Participant, but Case Conferences must be appropriately spaced across the Pre-Work Support period</p>

<p>13.10.	You will be required to give Jobcentre Plus 4-6 weeks’ notice to book the Case Conferences and a dedicated email address /inbox will be provided for your use.</p>

<p>13.11.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Compliance Officer (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officer">PCO</abbr>) checks will be put in place to establish if Case Conferences are taking place as expected.</p>

<p>13.12.	You should record all actions, Participant’s progress and agreed next steps arising from the Case Conference on the Participants’ <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan.</p>

<p>13.13.	If a Participant relocates to another Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>), responsibility for the case conferencing remains with the original provider.</p>

<h2>Taking part in <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Case Conferences</h2>

<p>13.14.	All Participants who start on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> and are in the Pre-Work Support period (i.e. up to day 456) will be expected to attend Case Conferences. This includes those Participants who are claiming a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit or allowance, and non-claimants.</p>

<p>13.15.	However, it is not mandatory for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Participants to take part in Case Conferences, and where a Participant is reluctant to engage in the process, you should explain to them the benefits of taking part, including the opportunity to review their needs and discuss the progress they are making</p>

<p>13.16.	The Case Conference process should be halted if the Participant refuses to engage as the Participant is key to the process. If they will not attend, then the Case Conferences cannot be held.</p>

<p>13.17.	Where the Participant will not engage with the Case Conference process, you should note this on their Action Plan, including all attempts made to try to get the Participant to engage. This should also be recorded on the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report</p>

<p>13.18.	<abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Participants who have moved into work (and are in the In-Work Support period) or have a planned start date, are not expected to attend Case Conferences.</p>

<h3>Who should attend the Case Conference</h3>

<p>13.19.	Alongside the Participant, Case Conference attendees should include the Participants’ key worker wherever possible and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> representative. For <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> claimants, this should be the Participants’ Work Coach, or the <abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr>, whichever is most practical.</p>

<p>13.20.	Additional attendees should be considered and agreed by you and the Work Coach for inclusion, where appropriate. For example, it may be beneficial for any of the following to attend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disability Employment Adviser (<abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>member of the Participants’ support network</li>
  <li>member of the Participants’ professional network, i.e. Support Worker</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arranging the Case Conference</h2>

<p>13.21.	Providers will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>agree a potential date/time and location for the Case Conference meeting with the Participant, using their agreed method of contact. This will ensure the Participant’s restrictions are taken into account, for example, regular medical appointments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish with the Participant whether any support arrangements are required for them to attend, for example, wheelchair access or where any other individuals, such as a carer or interpreter, need to attend the meeting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via e-mail to the shared mailbox with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a date/time for a pre-Case Conference discussion with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, if required</li>
      <li>a date/time/location for the Case Conference meeting (that has provisionally been agreed with the Participant)</li>
      <li>the names of those attending the meeting. This will ensure room space is considered and that the names of all visitors are provided to the Jobcentre in advance of the meeting. Any support arrangements that are required should also be included</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>13.22.	If the appropriate Work Coach is not available at the requested date and/or time, and at the location requested, the Work Coach will send you alternative arrangements, via e-mail, for both the pre-Case Conference (where required) and the Case Conference.</p>

<h2>Pre-Case Conference meeting</h2>

<p>13.23. There is the opportunity, if the provider deems it is appropriate, for a pre-Case Conference discussion to take place between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the provider, prior to each scheduled Case Conference - the Participant will not attend this meeting. This pre-call should preferably involve the consistent Key Worker, the Work Coach, and/or the <abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>13.24. 	This should be conducted via a telephone call, and must be arranged and facilitated by you, the provider. It should be noted that this pre-Case Conference meeting should last no longer than 20 minutes to allow the maximum amount of Jobcentre time for the scheduled Case Conference.</p>

<p>13.25.	As good practice, the pre-Case Conference discussion should take place at least a week before the scheduled Case Conference. This would allow for any actions and agreed support arrangements to be put in place, for example, booking a private interview room or ensuring an interpreter is booked.</p>

<p>13.26.	The pre-Case Conference is an opportunity for the provider to share information with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that may not be appropriate to discuss with the Participant present, for example, lack of engagement, failing to attend meetings or any behavioural issues.</p>

<p>13.27.	Some Participants may be particularly anxious about attending the Case Conference, or be reluctant to engage due to certain health conditions, for example, Autistic Spectrum conditions. You are expected to ensure that all attendees are aware of any potential issues or challenges, and agree the most conducive way to support the Participant.</p>

<p>13.28.	At the pre-Case Conference, you should discuss with the Work Coach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any issues or concerns and what action is being taken to address them</li>
  <li>any support arrangements that may be required for the Case Conference</li>
  <li>any additional attendees who would be appropriate to attend the Case Conference for example, the Disability Employment Adviser (<abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>13.29.	You should also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give a brief overview of the Participants’ progress to date, any issues that exist and what action is being taken to address them</li>
  <li>explain how you, the provider, are approaching the scheduled Case Conference and what areas of the Participant journey will be discussed</li>
</ul>

<p>13.30.	The Work Coach will telephone you to undertake the pre-Case Conference discussion at the agreed date and time. In the event that you are unable to answer the call, they will make a minimum of two attempts to further contact you. If you fail to respond, no further action will be taken.</p>

<h2>The Case Conference</h2>

<p>13.31.	The Case Conference meetings should be a positive and meaningful experience for <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Participants. They will provide the opportunity to review and discuss the Participant’s needs, their goals or milestones, any agreed actions, and the progress they are making. It should also be used to address any issues or concerns, or take account of any changes of circumstances, especially around medical conditions and other challenging/complex issues.</p>

<p>13.32.	 You should ensure that you use the Participants’ <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan to focus the conversation and consider progress against the Participants’ goals and milestones.</p>

<p>13.33. All Participants should, as set out at para 4.22, have their own copy of their <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan, and in a format appropriate to the Participant’s disabilities and health conditions. The <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan is personalised to the Participant and 
13.33	can be shared with the Work Coach/<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> representative, only where the participant gives their consent.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Claimants on <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Provision are required to meet their benefit conditionality requirements, including interviews with their work coach, whilst participating in <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>. Information on the Participant’s journey, including goals and milestones, will have been recorded on the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> system, and work coaches or the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> representative should have access to this information to support the case conferencing process.</p>

<p>For non-claimants, relevant information can be shared with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> representative, with Participant consent.</p>

<p>13.34. In relation to other attendees at the Case Conference, you should consider carefully what information needs to be shared in order to allow them to support the Participant and take part in discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When sharing personal data with a Participant’s support network you must ensure that you comply at all times with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and other relevant data protection legislation. You must obtain the Participant’s consent if you propose to share their personal data with their support network. If a Participant does not give their consent, or gives their consent and later withdraws it, then you must not share the Participant’s personal data with their support network</p>

<p>13.35.	Throughout the Case Conference, the Participant should be encouraged to take part in the meeting, to help shape the conversation and agree their own actions and/or next steps.</p>

<p>13.36.	Whilst you will be leading the Case Conference discussion, the Work Coach and/or <abbr title="Disability Employment Adviser">DEA</abbr> (if present) must also be able to ask questions to clarify anything that is being discussed, with the aim of supporting the Participant.</p>

<p>13.37.	You will need to consider, amongst other questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the provision supporting the Participant’s needs?</li>
  <li>has the provision helped with the Participant’s overall health and wellbeing?</li>
  <li>has the provision addressed, or is it addressing, the Participant’s complex barriers to work?</li>
</ul>

<p>13.38.	Discussions should also cover, or touch on, areas such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general self-efficacy</li>
  <li>jobsearch self-efficacy</li>
  <li>job seeking activity, where relevant</li>
  <li>managing their health condition or disability.</li>
  <li>goals and aspirations</li>
</ul>

<p>13.39.	You should share how you think the Participant is progressing and discuss any relevant changes that you think should be made to the Action Plan.</p>

<h3>Participant fails to attend the Case Conference</h3>

<p>13.40.	If the Participant fails to attend the Case Conference, you must contact the Participant to establish why they have not attended at the agreed time. If the Participant explains that they are on their way or running late, then you must decide whether the meeting needs to be cancelled or rearranged.</p>

<p>13.41.	Where possible, the Case Conference should go ahead if the Participant is delayed. This will prevent the Participant having to come back to the Jobcentre at a later date.</p>

<p>13.42.	The provider should attempt to contact the Participant a minimum of three times over a reasonable period of time to establish why they have not attended.</p>

<p>13.43.	If the meeting does need to be cancelled or rearranged, you must inform the Work Coach and other attendees immediately. Where appropriate, take action to rearrange the Case Conference to another suitable date/time, taking into account the Work Coach and Participant’s availability.</p>

<h3>Provider unable to attend the Case Conference</h3>

<p>13.44.	If the key worker (or your representative) is unable to attend the Case Conference, you should take immediate action to advise the Participant, the Work Coach and any other attendees then rearrange the Case Conference for another suitable date/time, taking into account the Work Coach and Participant’s availability.</p>

<p>13.45.	Whilst there will be occasions where you are unable to attend, this should be minimal. Repeatedly cancelling or failing to attend Case Conferences will be escalated to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Managers for discussion at your monthly Contract Performance Reviews (<abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Recording the Case Conference Outputs</h3>

<p>13.46.	The Participant’s <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Action Plan must be updated with the key points and agreed actions agreed at the meeting. You must ensure that completed Case Conference dates are recorded on the Participant’s records as, following future reviews as set out at the start of this chapter, the arranging and facilitating of Case Conferences may be a Customer Service Standard against which you will be measured.</p>

<p>13.47.	Key points and agreed actions from the Case Conferences will also be recorded on the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report and <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Exit Activity Plan when the Participant has reached the end of their time on provision. You will therefore need to keep a record of key points and agreed actions from the Case Conference on the Participant’s records, in order to reproduce them onto the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report and <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Exit Activity Plan.</p>

<h2>Final Case Conference: Warm Handback and Exit planning</h2>

<p>13.48.	The third and final Case Conference should take place at 15 months, before the Participant is due to end their time on provision and may also constitute the Warm Handback to Jobcentre Plus, where required. At this final Case Conference, (or Warm Handback), you must present evidence of how you have prepared the Participant to continue on their journey nearer or into employment.</p>

<p>13.49.	Arranging and facilitating the Warm Handback will be a Customer Service Standard (CSS4) against which you will be measured.</p>

<p>13.50.	You should look at how Participants will transition back to Jobcentre Plus, with activity to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping Participants take stock of their job search skills/needs</li>
  <li>helping Participants to look ahead to job search independently</li>
  <li>helping Participants by enabling access to appropriate medical support following <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>, including both physical and mental health support, counselling and mentoring, for example</li>
  <li>helping with advice on the continued engagement with the labour market</li>
  <li>helping with identifying other related services/interventions, as appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>13.51.	A copy of the final Action Plan should be issued to the Participant at the last Case Conference, or Warm Handback. If the Action Plan needs to be revised following discussions, the provider must update it and send it to the Participant within 10 days of <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision ending.</p>

<p>13.52.	You should also use the information gathered to complete the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report, which must be produced within 10 working days of provision ending and must be retained by the provider and issued to Jobcentre Plus within 10 working days of being requested. The <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report will detail what progress the Participant has made during their time on the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> provision.</p>

<p>13.53.	Key points and agreed actions from Case Conferences should also be included on the Participants’ <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Progress Report within the Further Information section on Page 3, and on the <abbr title="Intensive Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr> Exit Activity Plan.</p>
