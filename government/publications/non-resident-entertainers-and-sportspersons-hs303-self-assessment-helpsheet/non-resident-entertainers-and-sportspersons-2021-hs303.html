<p>Read this helpsheet before you refer to any other printed material to save time and reduce the risk of error.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Why this helpsheet is important</h2>
<p>Some tax rules, and treaty provisions in double taxation agreements, apply only to non-resident entertainers and sportspersons. The sorts of income you get and the expenses you incur may be different from other taxpayers. Also, you may visit the UK infrequently and your UK income may have suffered withholding tax in full or in part. You may therefore need specific help in several areas. This helpsheet will help you to understand the special rules and give you some guidance about various sorts of income, the expenses you can deduct and how to complete the relevant parts of the tax return.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How you should use the helpsheet</h2>
<p>We suggest you use it as a signpost to direct you to the relevant parts of the tax return for your UK activity as an entertainer or sportsperson. You can return to this helpsheet after each step in the process is completed for the next set of directions.</p>

<p>If you’ve some non-performance UK income, for example, interest or rents, some general advice will also be given towards the end of this helpsheet.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What help is available</h2>
<p>The special rules for non-resident entertainers and sportspersons are the responsibility of a specialist office - the Foreign Entertainers Unit (<abbr title="Foreign Entertainers Unit">FEU</abbr>), whose contact details are:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Charities, Savings and International 1
<br>HMRC  
<br>BX9 1AU
<br>
<br>Telephone: 03000 547 395 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>In addition, other helpsheets are available on specific topics which give more detailed information about particular tax rules, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets">Self Assessment forms and helpsheets</a>. We will refer to the relevant helpsheets in the computational advice section as each point is covered and they will be summarised at the end of this helpsheet.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Computational advice</h2>
<p>This helpsheet is only relevant if you’re a non-resident entertainer or sportsperson. Your starting point should therefore be to check your UK tax residence status using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc</a> pages and the ‘notes’ provided with them.</p>

<p>If, having worked through the ‘Considering your residence status’ section, you find that you’re regarded as resident in the UK for tax purposes, ignore the remainder of this helpsheet. Use the tax return guide to help you complete your tax return.</p>

<p>If you find that you’re regarded as non-resident in the UK for tax purposes, put ‘X’ in box 1 of the ‘Residence, remittance basis etc’ pages. You may return to this helpsheet after you’ve completed the remaining relevant boxes on pages RR 1 and RR 2. However, bear in mind that the special rules applying to non-resident entertainers and sportspersons generally makes domicile irrelevant as far as their performance income is concerned.</p>

<p>The information in section 6.62 and 6.63 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax-liability">RDR1: residence, domicile and the remittance basis</a> is modified by the UK’s entertainers and sportspersons rules which also provide for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>withholding at source as a payment on account of final liability</li>
  <li>the creation of a separate notional UK trade for tax purposes for activity in this country</li>
  <li>income paid to certain third parties, for example, a personal service company, to be treated as made to an entertainer or sportsperson personally</li>
</ul>

<p>When you’ve completed the ‘Residence, remittance basis etc’ pages you’re ready to complete other parts of your tax return.</p>

<p>To target the information to your particular needs and to minimise the amount of material you’ve to read, the rest of this helpsheet has been split into 3 parts.</p>

<p>Part A – the self-employed individual<br> Part B – the employee<br> Part C – partnerships and partners</p>

<p>Please decide which of these options best describes your status in relation to your activity as a non-resident entertainer or sportsperson and follow the guidance in the relevant part.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Part A – the self-employed individual</h2>
<p>As a self-employed person you should complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full)</a> pages using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full) notes</a>, with the following modifications. Box numbers refer to the Self-employment (full).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Accounting period</h3>
<p>The basis of assessment is the profit from UK activity arising in the year ended 5 April. In practice, UK activity by non-resident entertainers and sportspersons is usually limited to one or more short periods in the year and the receipts and expenses can be easily identified and summarised. The accounting period should, however, generally be shown as starting on 6 April and ending on 5 April.</p>

<p>If your worldwide trade, profession or vocation commenced or ceased in 2020 to 2021 complete box 6 or 7, otherwise you may leave them blank. You can ignore boxes 11, 12, and 14.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Turnover</h3>
<p>This should include amounts applicable to UK activity no matter who it’s paid to. For example, and where appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>performance income</li>
  <li>appearance fees</li>
  <li>bonuses for UK performance</li>
  <li>exhibition income</li>
  <li>box office percentage</li>
  <li>broadcasting or media fees,</li>
  <li>tournament winnings</li>
  <li>prize money</li>
  <li>venue merchandising income</li>
  <li>transfer of assets</li>
  <li>sponsorship or endorsement monies</li>
</ul>

<p>If any amounts are paid under a contract covering several countries, or assets are transferred the income or value of the asset transferred should be apportioned to the UK on a just and reasonable basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Expenses</h3>
<p>You should claim UK-specific expenses and a proportion of any expense common to several
countries including the UK. When expenditure common to several countries has been incurred you should apportion the expenditure to the UK on a just and reasonable basis. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-from-your-accounts-hs229-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 229 Information from your accounts</a> may add to the general guidance on turnover, allowable expenses and taxable profit or loss given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full) notes</a>. You should include any expenses met on your behalf and not reimbursed by you in your turnover and you should claim it separately as expenditure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Overseas tax</h3>
<p>You should claim any tax which you pay in the UK on your performance-related income in your home state if it has a double taxation agreement (<abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr>) with the UK. Your home state tax is not deductible in arriving at your performance-related profit for UK tax purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Capital allowances</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-calculate-your-taxable-profits-hs222-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 222 How to calculate your taxable profits</a> explains how capital allowances and balancing charges are calculated. You may only claim capital allowances for assets used for the UK notional trade. If you’ve 
purchased assets for your worldwide trade but they are not used in connection with your UK activity, you should not claim allowances. If assets are used in your worldwide trade including UK activity, do a separate computation for each asset so used. The allowances must be restricted to take account of the use of the asset in non-UK territories and private use. One way to do this would be to restrict the allowances using the fraction:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Number of days asset used for UK activity ÷ 365</p>
</div>

<p>The helpsheet also gives guidance on the calculation of an allowance or charge when an asset, on which allowances have been given, is sold.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Adjustments to arrive at the taxable profit or loss</h3>
<p>Your basis period will begin on 6 April 2020 (unless your worldwide trade, profession or vocation commenced after that date when you should use the date of commencement) and end on 5 April 2021 (or the date your worldwide trade, profession or vocation ceased, if earlier). You may ignore boxes 13 and 68 to 72. Take the figure in box 64 to box 73 if it’s a profit or take the figure in box 65 to box 77 if it’s a loss.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Losses</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/losses-hs227-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 227 Losses</a> tells you how you may claim Tax Relief on losses. It will help you to decide which of the boxes 74 to 78 to complete if box 77 shows a loss or there’s a loss brought forward from a previous year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Profit summary</h3>
<p>To finalise page SEF 4  for your activity as an entertainer or sportsperson, if there was a net profit figure in box 73 complete boxes 74, 75 and 76.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.9 </span>Pages SEF 4 and SEF 5 entries</h3>
<p>Non-residents are exempt from Class 4 National Insurance contributions, so put ‘X’ in 
box 101 and leave boxes 100 and 102 blank. Box 82 should be used to record the withholding tax paid on your income as an entertainer or sportsperson. Unless you’ve prepared a balance sheet specifically for the UK notional trade, you may leave boxes 83 to 99 blank.</p>

<p>Before you move on, please enter the following information in the ‘Any other information’ box, box 103, in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full)</a> pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name and tax reference of the company who employs you if it’s registered or managed and controlled in the UK</li>
  <li>amount of any money paid, or to be paid to you, by the company for your UK activity</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will enable the <abbr title="Foreign Entertainers Unit">FEU</abbr> to make any other adjustments needed under the special entertainers and sportspersons rules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.10 </span>Next steps</h3>
<p>When you’ve completed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full)</a> pages of your tax return consider whether other supplementary pages are needed, then go back to page TR 2 in the tax return.</p>

<p>If you identify any UK source income or capital gains you should refer back to section 6.62 and 6.63 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax-liability">RDR1: residence, domicile and the remittance basis</a> to see if the relevant item is liable to UK tax. If it is, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets">Self Assessment forms and helpsheets</a>. You should fill in any supplementary pages before you go back to page TR 2 in your tax return.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc notes</a> will also help you to decide whether allowances are due to you. They do not, however, explain which of the reliefs are not available to non-residents or are only available in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>You should complete the remaining questions on your tax return as appropriate.</p>

<p>If you want to calculate your own tax, you will need the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">Tax calculation summary</a> pages and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">notes</a>. Include UK withholding tax in box A236 on the working sheet.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Part B – the employee</h2>
<p>If you’re employed by a company or individual(s) in connection with your activity as an entertainer or sportsperson, answer the following questions to determine how you need to proceed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Was the money from your entertainment or sporting activity paid to the following. Please tick either ‘No’ or ‘Yes’.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">No</th>
      <th scope="col">Yes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A person, for example, a company, you control</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A person resident in a country where the rate of tax on profits does not<br>exceed 25%</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A trust or other settlement partly or wholly set up by you</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A person with whom you’ve a contract which will or may give you<br>an amount approximating to the net profit from the activity</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>If you answered ‘No’ to all of these questions and you regard yourself as an employee, you will need to complete the ‘Employment’ (and perhaps the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-additional-information-sa101">Additional information</a>) pages using the notes for these and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-residence-and-domicile-issues-hs211-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 211 Employment – residence and domicile issues</a>.</p>

<p>The aim of the notes and helpsheet is to isolate the money or benefits for your UK activity. 
If you’ve a multi-territory employment contract, you may wish to contact the <abbr title="Foreign Entertainers Unit">FEU</abbr> for advice on how your money from the company and benefits should be apportioned into and 
out of UK liability. When you’ve completed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> page, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-additional-information-sa101">Additional information</a> pages, if relevant, see the ‘Next steps’ below.</p>

<p>If you’ve answered ‘Yes’ to any of these questions, the receipts and expenses linked to your activity in the UK are treated as made to or by you personally. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> page should not be used for your entertainment or sporting activity. Instead, you should complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full)</a> pages using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full) notes</a> with the following modifications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Accounting period</h3>
<p>For non-resident entertainers and sportspersons this will generally be 6 April to the following 5 April. If your employment commenced or ceased during the year, complete boxes 6 or 7, otherwise you can leave these blank. You can ignore boxes 11, 12 and 14.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Turnover</h3>

<p>This should include amounts applicable to UK activity no matter who it’s paid to. For example, and where appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>performance income</li>
  <li>appearance fees</li>
  <li>bonuses for UK performance</li>
  <li>exhibition income</li>
  <li>box office percentage</li>
  <li>broadcasting or media fees,</li>
  <li>tournament winnings</li>
  <li>prize money</li>
  <li>venue merchandising income</li>
  <li>transfer of assets</li>
  <li>sponsorship or endorsement monies</li>
</ul>

<p>If any amounts are paid under a contract covering several countries, or assets are transferred the income or value of the asset transferred should be apportioned to the UK on a just and reasonable basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Expenses</h3>
<p>Find out the expenses which have arisen as a result of your activity. They may be expenses which have arisen wholly in the UK, for example, hotel expenses or a proportion of any expense common to several countries.</p>

<p>When expenditure common to several countries has been incurred the expenditure should be apportioned to the UK on a just and reasonable basis. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full) notes</a> provide general guidance on turnover, allowable expenses and taxable profit or loss.</p>

<p>If a promoter or independent third party has met expenses on your employer’s behalf without reimbursement, for example, travel, you should include the amount in turnover and claim separately as expenditure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Overseas tax</h3>
<p>You should claim any tax paid in the UK on your performance-related income in your home state if it has a <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK. Your home state tax is not deductible in arriving at your performance-related profit for UK tax purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Capital allowances</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-calculate-your-taxable-profits-hs222-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 222 How to calculate your taxable profits</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-allowances-and-balancing-charges-hs252-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 252 Capital allowances and balancing charges</a> shows how these allowances are calculated. Capital allowances can only be claimed in your calculations if assets are used for the UK activity. If the assets acquired by yourself or your employer are used for worldwide entertainment or sporting activity but they are not used in the UK, you should not claim allowances. If assets are used in several territories including the UK, a separate computation is needed for each asset. The allowances must be restricted to take account of use of the asset in non-UK territories and private use. One way to do this would be to restrict the allowances using the fraction:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Number of days asset used for UK activity ÷ 365</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-allowances-and-balancing-charges-hs252-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 252</a> also gives guidance on the calculation of an allowance or charge when an asset on which allowances have been given is sold.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Adjustments to arrive at the taxable profit or loss</h3>
<p>The Income Tax basis period will begin on 6 April 2020 (unless your employment commenced after that date when you should use the date of commencement) and end on 5 April 2021 (or the date your employment ceased, if earlier). You may ignore boxes 12 and 68 to 81. Take the figure in box 64 to box 73 if it’s a profit or take the figure in box 65 to box 77 if it’s a loss.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Losses</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/losses-hs227-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 227 Losses</a>, tells you how you may claim tax relief on losses. It will help you to decide which of the boxes 74 to 78 to complete if box 77 shows a loss or there’s a loss brought forward from a previous year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>Profit summary</h3>
<p>To finalise  page SEF 4 for your activity as an entertainer or sportsperson, if there was a net profit figure in box 73 complete boxes 74, 75 and 76.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span>Pages SEF 4 and SEF 5 entries</h3>
<p>Non-residents are exempt from Class 4 National Insurance contributions, so put ‘X’ in box 101 and leave boxes 100 and 102 blank. Box 82 should be used to record the withholding tax paid on your activity as an entertainer or sportsperson. As you do not have a balance sheet for the UK activity, you may leave boxes 83 to 99 blank.</p>

<p>Before you move on, please enter the following information in the ‘Any other information’ box, box 103, in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-self-employment-full-sa103f">Self-employment (full)</a> pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name and tax reference of the company who employs you if it’s registered or managed and controlled in the UK</li>
  <li>amount of any money paid, or to be paid to you, by the company for your UK activity</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will enable the <abbr title="Foreign Entertainers Unit">FEU</abbr> to make any other adjustments needed under the special entertainers and sportspersons rules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.10 </span>Next steps</h3>
<p>When you’ve completed the relevant pages of your tax return for your entertainment or sporting activity, consider whether other supplementary pages are needed. We’ve sent you the tax return guide to help you.</p>

<p>If you identify any other UK source income or capital gains, you should refer back to section 6.62 and 6.63 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax-liability">RDR1: residence, domicile and the remittance basis</a> to see if the relevant item is liable to UK tax. If it is see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets">Self Assessment forms and helpsheets</a>. You should fill in any supplementary pages before you go back to page TR 2 of your tax return.</p>

<p>If no more supplementary pages are required you will only have to complete either box 8 and box 1 (if the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> page was completed) or box 8 and box 2 modified to read ‘were you treated as self-employed’ (for example, if you were directed to complete pages SEF 1) leaving box 1 blank before proceeding to the reliefs/allowances sections.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc notes</a> will also help you to decide whether allowances are due to you. They do not, however, explain which of the reliefs are not available to non-residents or are only available in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>You should complete the remaining questions on the tax return as appropriate.</p>

<p>If you want to calculate your own tax, you will need the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">Tax calculation summary</a> pages and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">notes</a>. Include all UK withholding tax in box A236 on the working sheet.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Part C – partnerships and partners</h2>
<p>A partner, who is not resident in the UK, is taxable on their share of the profits arising to the partnership from the activity which the partnership carried on in the UK. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/partnerships-foreign-aspects-hs380-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 380 Partnerships: foreign aspects</a>, gives advice on who should make a Partnership Tax Return and what it should include. The advice contained in this section assumes your partnership consists solely of individuals who are all entertainers or sportspersons. If the partners include a company, a trustee or any person who is not an entertainer or sportsperson, please contact the <abbr title="Foreign Entertainers Unit">FEU</abbr> for advice before proceeding further, as special rules exist which may require their share of receipts and expenses to be treated as made to some or all of the remaining partners.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Partnership Tax Return</h3>
<p>The partnership return of profit from UK activity should be completed by the partner nominated to complete the tax return using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-tax-return-sa800">Partnership Tax Return and Guide</a> with the following modifications.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Foreign income and chargeable assets</h3>
<p>The reference here is to items chargeable to UK tax.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Accounting period</h3>
<p>You may ignore the references to the return period and accounting periods in the guide as the basis of assessment is the profit from UK activity arising in the year ended 5 April. In practice, UK activity by non-resident entertainers is usually limited to one or more short periods within the year and the receipts and expenses can be easily identified and summarised.</p>

<p>The accounting period should, however, generally be shown as starting on 6 April and ending on 5 April.</p>

<p>You should only complete boxes 3.7 and 3.8 if the partnership commenced or ceased in the year. You can ignore boxes 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Turnover</h3>
<p>This should include amounts applicable to UK activity no matter who it’s paid to. For example, and where appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>performance income</li>
  <li>appearance fees</li>
  <li>bonuses for UK performance</li>
  <li>exhibition income</li>
  <li>box office percentage</li>
  <li>broadcasting or media fees,</li>
  <li>tournament winnings</li>
  <li>prize money</li>
  <li>venue merchandising income</li>
  <li>transfer of assets</li>
  <li>sponsorship or endorsement monies</li>
</ul>

<p>If any amounts are paid under a contract covering several countries, or assets are transferred the income or value of the asset transferred should be apportioned to the UK on a just and reasonable basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Expenses</h3>
<p>You should claim UK-specific expenses and a proportion of any expense common to several countries, including the UK. When expenditure common to several countries has been incurred the expenditure should be apportioned to the UK on a just and reasonable basis. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-tax-return-sa800">Partnership Tax Return and Guide</a> provides general guidance on turnover, allowable expenses and taxable profit or loss. Any expenses met on behalf of the partnership and not reimbursed by it should be included in turnover and claimed separately as expenditure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span>Overseas tax</h3>
<p>Any tax which the partnership pays in the UK on its performance-related income should be claimed in the partner’s home state if it has a <abbr title="Double Taxation Agreement">DTA</abbr> with the UK. Home state tax is not deductible in arriving at the partnership’s performance-related profit for UK tax purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span>Capital allowances</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-calculate-your-taxable-profits-hs222-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 222 How to calculate your taxable profits</a> is available to explain how these allowances are calculated. The partnership may only claim capital allowances for assets used for the UK notional trade. If it has purchased assets for its worldwide trade but they are not used in connection with its UK activity, allowances should not be claimed. If assets are used in the partnership’s worldwide trade including UK activity, do a separate computation for each asset so used. The allowances must be restricted to take account of use of the assets in non-UK territories and private use. One way to do this would be to restrict the allowances using the fraction:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Number of days asset used for UK activity ÷ 365</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-calculate-your-taxable-profits-hs222-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 222</a> also gives guidance on the calculation of an allowance or charge when an asset on which allowances have been given is sold.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.8 </span>Adjustments to arrive at the taxable profit or loss</h3>
<p>Use box 3.98 to record any UK withholding tax paid on the partnership income from entertainment or sporting activity.</p>

<p>As the partnership is unlikely to have prepared a separate balance sheet for the notional UK trade, boxes 3.99 to 3.115 can be left blank.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.9 </span>Question 7 - other income</h3>
<p>This is another reference to items chargeable to UK tax. Section 6.62 and 6.63 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax-liability">RDR1: residence, domicile and the remittance basis</a> will indicate situations when a ‘Yes’ answer will be appropriate and boxes 7.7A to 7.9A of the Partnership Tax Return need to be completed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.10 </span>Partnership statement</h3>
<p>This is a summary of the main boxes on previous pages plus an allocation of those items between the partners. Use the basis period already identified on the Partnership Tax Return (generally 6 April 2019 to 5 April 2020). Tax withheld should go in box 24A.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.11 </span>Other information</h3>
<p>You should complete question 10 on page 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-tax-return-sa800">Partnership Tax Return</a> giving details of provisional figures and any other additional information you consider relevant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.12 </span>Partner’s returns – Partnership (full) pages</h3>
<p>When the Partnership Tax Return is finalised, you will be in a position to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-full-sa104f">Partnership (full)</a> pages using the notes provided with the following modifications.</p>

<p>Your basis period for your entertainer or sports partnership will be the one identified on the Partnership Tax Return (generally 6 April 2020 to 5 April 2021).</p>

<p>Your share of profit or loss for 2020 to 2021 should be the one shown on the Partnership Tax Return and should  be entered in box 16 or box 21 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-full-sa104f">Partnership (full)</a> pages, as appropriate, without adjustment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.13 </span>Losses</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/losses-hs227-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 227 Losses</a> provides information on how the partnership may claim tax relief on losses. It will help you to decide which of the loss boxes to complete if you’ve made a loss from the partnership or there’s a partnership loss brought forward from a previous year from relevant UK activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.14 </span>Class 4 National Insurance contributions</h3>
<p>Most non-residents are exempt from Class 4 National Insurance contributions, so put ‘X’ in box 26 and leave boxes 25 and 27 blank.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.15 </span>FEU2 tax</h3>
<p>Your share should be entered in box 79.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.16 </span>Next steps</h3>
<p>When you’ve completed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-partnership-full-sa104f">Partnership (full)</a> pages of your tax return, consider whether other supplementary pages are needed. If you identify any UK source income or capital gains not previously returned from your reading of the guides, you should refer back to section 6.62 and 6.63 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax-liability">RDR1: residence, domicile and the remittance basis</a> to see if the relevant item is liable to UK tax. If it is see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-forms-and-helpsheets">Self Assessment forms and helpsheets</a>. You should fill in any supplementary pages before you go back to page TR 2 of your tax return.</p>

<p>If no more supplementary pages are needed you will only have to complete question 4 and question 8 on page TR 2 of your tax return before proceeding to the reliefs/allowances sections.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc notes</a> will also help you to decide whether allowances are due to you. They do not, however, explain which of the reliefs are not available to non-residents or are only available in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>You should complete the remaining questions on your tax return as appropriate.</p>

<p>If you want to calculate your own tax, you will need the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-calculation-summary-sa110">Tax calculation summary</a> pages and ‘notes’. Include UK withholding tax in box A236 on the working sheet.</p>
