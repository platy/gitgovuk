<p>We have published anonymised clarification questions received to the Automatic Asset Registration Programme inbox.</p>

<p>The responses to the questions are correct at the time of publication. We will not update the responses here if changes occur to the programme, so please check the most recent programme documentation for the latest information.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is the expected support to be provided by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> / Ofgem to promote the usage of the Automatic Asset Registration solution for new connections and for the retrofit of existing connections, for example new regulation, marketing, incentives for installers, or others?</strong></p>

<p>The aim of this <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> competition is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an automatic, automated secure data exchange process for registering new small-scale energy assets, and there is no guaranteed future funding for a system-wide deployment of the technology. Any future funding for automatic asset registration would depend on the outputs from this programme and future policy decisions taken by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, which may be informed by the outcomes of this programme.</p>

<p>The focus of this Competition is on registering new small-scale low-carbon assets, of which millions are expected to come onto the grid in the coming years as part of the UK’s transition to net zero by 2050. An innovative technical solution that automatically registers assets upon installation through an automated, standardised, and secure data exchange process would be a key enabler for improving visibility and could remove the element of incentive for installers entirely. We recognise the importance of registering existing assets and we will continue to work together with Ofgem and Industry to improve the registration of these connections through the development of a Central Asset Register. Following the completion of Phase 1 of this Competition, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will review how this programme of work fits together with ongoing projects within government.</p>

<p><strong>2. What are the legal and commercial commitments (including expected service levels) for the selected candidate relating to operating and maintaining the solution in the short, medium and long term?</strong></p>

<p>The aim of this <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> competition is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an automatic, automated secure data exchange process for registering small-scale energy assets. Any future legal or commercial commitments would depend on future policy decisions taken by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, which may be informed by the outcomes of this programme, particularly the Feasibility Study stage in which projects will explore the technical, legal and cyber security requirements for the proposed solution, as well as a route to market assessment to identify an appropriate commercial model.</p>

<p><strong>3. What is the expectation in terms of interoperability, communication standards and protocols for the connected assets communication for the « additional requirement » and any related timelines?</strong></p>

<p>At present, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is taking an agnostic approach with respect to the development of this technology and is not favouring the implementation of particular communication standards and protocols over others. However, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expects the use of recognised standards (for example, <abbr title="British Standards">BS</abbr>, <abbr title="European Electrotechnical Commission Standards">ENIEC</abbr> approved) and non-proprietary open protocols wherever possible and welcomes assurances on the cyber security of the overall system. The rationale for including the exchange of dynamic asset data as part of the requirements for this Competition is to ensure that the software and data architecture developed is future proof and could be further developed to meet potential future requirements and opportunities with respect to small-scale energy asset data.</p>

<p><strong>4. Would an adapted software kernel be considered instead of only newly developed solutions?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, an adapted software kernel would be considered. In line with Section 7.1 of the Competition Guidance Notes, projects may use existing technology and software components, provided that the final solution is innovative with respect to its implementation in the UK energy system, its ability to facilitate automatic asset registration, and its ability to enable the secure digitalised exchange of energy asset data. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> cannot provide funding for solutions that are already widely deployed and/or the demonstration and trialling of technology solutions which have previously received public funding and are being repurposed.</p>

<p><strong>5. The business model for rolling out. Do we have to participate now to be in the running for the main system deployment?</strong></p>

<p>The aim of this <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> competition is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an automatic, automated secure data exchange process for registering small-scale energy assets and any system wide deployment would be subject to future policy decisions taken by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>, which may be informed by the outcomes of this innovation programme. Following the Pilot Demonstration, successful Phase 3 projects may go on to commercialise and deploy their solution and only those projects who have participated in Phases 1 and 2 will be eligible to receive funding for Phase 3. Participation in this competition would benefit Projects to develop their solution whilst engaging with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and Ofgem on the topic of automatic asset registration, ensuring it is aligned with broader future policy objectives.</p>

<p><strong>6. Is it only the case that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> obtains the <abbr title="intellectual property">IP</abbr> of the solution if it is not offered to the market within 5 years of completion of the call?</strong></p>

<p>The funding route for this Programme is a Small Business Research Initiative (<abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr>). Under the <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> approach, all intellectual property generated through the <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> is retained by the Project(s), with certain rights of use retained by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>. In line with clause 28(5) of the Standard Terms and Conditions, the Authority may request the intellectual property generated through this <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> be assigned to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> should projects not have commercially exploited it within 5 years of its creation.</p>
