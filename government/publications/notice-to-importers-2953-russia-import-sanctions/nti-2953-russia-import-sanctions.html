<p>This notice provides an overview of the import prohibitions in force on certain goods imported into the UK, including Northern Ireland, that have originated in or have been consigned from the territory covered by what is now the Russian Federation and non-government controlled Ukrainian territory<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. It also sets out the licensing process for traders looking to import goods subject to prohibitions.</p>

<p>It should be read alongside the statutory guidance published by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (<abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>). This notice has no legal effect, and in case of conflict with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/russia-sanctions-guidance/russia-sanctions-guidance">statutory guidance</a> published by the <abbr title="Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office">FCDO</abbr>, the statutory guidance will prevail.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/contents/made" rel="external">Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the Russia Sanctions Regulations)</a> came into force on 1 January 2021. It replaced, with substantially the same effect, relevant existing EU legislation, corresponding prohibitions in the Open General Import Licence (OGIL) and related UK regulations. This sanctions regime is aimed at encouraging Russia to cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.</p>

<p>On 30 March 2022, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/395/made" rel="external">Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 7) Regulations 2022</a> amended the 2019 regulations. This amendment extends the existing import sanctions measures in relation to Crimea and the city of Sevastopol to the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine.</p>

<p>On 14 April 2022 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/452/regulation/4/made" rel="external">Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 8) Regulations 2022</a> amended the 2019 regulations. This amendment extends the existing import sanctions measures by prohibiting the import, acquisition, supply and delivery, directly or indirectly, of finished steel and articles of iron and steel.</p>

<h2>Import prohibitions</h2>

<p>The import prohibitions specified in the Russia Sanctions Regulations are set out below:</p>

<h3>Regulation 23</h3>

<p>The import of arms and related materiel is prohibited.</p>

<p>This includes all military goods, and anything which falls within chapter 93 of the Goods Classification table, other than military goods.</p>

<p>These goods are prohibited where they are consigned from or originated from the territory which is comprised within what is now the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>This means that the prohibition extends to goods originating in those parts of the Soviet Union and Imperial Russia that are now comprised within the Russian Federation. The prohibition applies even if those goods are not consigned from what is now the Russian Federation (for example, arms manufactured near Moscow in 1945 but imported from the US).</p>

<h3>Regulation 46D to 46F</h3>

<p>Under Regulation 46D of the Russia Sanctions Regulations (as amended), the import of iron and steel products (as specified in Schedule 3B to the Russia Sanctions Regulations) that are consigned from or originate in Russia is prohibited. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not Russia, the prohibition may still apply.</p>

<p>There are further prohibitions related to finished steel and articles of iron and steel that are set out in the Russia Sanctions Regulations (as amended), including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regulation 46E: the acquisition of finished steel and articles of iron and steel products</li>
  <li>Regulation 46F: the supply or delivery of finished steel and articles of iron and steel products</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regulation 47</h3>

<p>Prohibits the import of any goods originating in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory into the UK.</p>

<p>This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, the prohibition may still apply.</p>

<p>Under Regulation 52 (3), the direct or indirect provision of financial services or funds in pursuance or in connection with the import into the UK of goods originating in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory is prohibited.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/part/7/made" rel="external">Part 7 of the regulations</a> also sets out exceptions to some of the import prohibitions which apply within certain defined circumstances. An exception applies automatically and does not require you to obtain a licence issued in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>There are 3 exceptions specified in the Russia Sanctions Regulations (as amended) that are set out below:</p>

<h3>Regulation 60ZA</h3>

<p>The import of prohibited goods and the provision of financial services  and funds (prohibitions in regulations 47 and 52(3)) from the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts is permitted if related to an obligation arising from a contract concluded before 23 February 2022.</p>

<p>For this exception to apply, the action carried out under these contracts, or ancillary contracts necessary for their execution, must be  carried out by 24 August 2022. The Secretary of State for the Department for International Trade (DIT) should also be informed at least 10 working days in advance of this exception being used. This can be done by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:importcontrols@trade.gov.uk">importcontrols@trade.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Regulation 62</h3>

<p>Provides for an exception in relation to prohibitions relating to the import of goods originating in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory (regulation 47), where those goods have been satisfactorily certified by or on behalf of the Government of Ukraine as originating in Ukraine.</p>

<h3>Regulation 63</h3>

<p>The prohibitions mentioned above do not apply if the act is one which a ‘responsible officer’ (for example, a government or agency official) has determined would be in the interests of national security, or the prevention or detection of serious crime in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Trade sanctions licences</h2>

<p>A licence is a written authorisation that permits an otherwise prohibited activity. DIT’s Import Licensing Branch (ILB) is responsible for administering the licensing provisions on behalf of the Secretary of State for all trade sanction licence applications from importers.</p>

<p>Where traders are looking to import goods prohibited under regulations 23 and 47, and where an exception does not apply, you will need to make a licence application through ILB’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ilb.trade.gov.uk/icms/fox/live/IMP_LOGIN/login" rel="external">Import Case Management System (<abbr title="Import Case Management System">ICMS</abbr>)</a>. You will need to register on <abbr title="Import Case Management System">ICMS</abbr>, if you do not already have an account, and submit an importer access request.</p>

<p>Please then contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:importcontrols@trade.gov.uk">importcontrols@trade.gov.uk</a> with details of your proposed import for further instruction. We will then consider each application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether granting a licence would be consistent with the stated purposes of the sanctions regime and any <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> or other relevant international law obligations.</p>

<p>For the prohibition under regulation 23, and 46D to 46F, there are some specific activities that we consider likely to be consistent with the aims of the sanctions regime. These are set out below and in further detail in the statutory guidance. If you think that your proposed activity falls within one of these specific descriptions, you should make this clear and explain why you believe this to be the case in your application for a licence. The Secretary of State for International Trade is ultimately responsible for decisions to grant or refuse a trade sanctions licence in any individual case.</p>

<p>You should not assume that a licence will be granted or engage in any activities prohibited by trade sanctions until your licence has been granted. If you are unclear on any aspect of the regulations and in what cases a trade sanctions licence is required, we recommend that you seek independent legal advice in the first instance.</p>

<p>In line with the requirements of the Northern Ireland Protocol, licences are not required for imports or exports of non-military goods covered by sanctions between Northern Ireland and EU member states. Licences will however be required from the relevant EU member state to move items to or from the sanctioned country. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK import or export control legislation as applicable.</p>

<h2>Consideration for licensing</h2>

<p>Licences may be issued for the import of military goods or technology subject to <strong>one or more</strong> of the conditions being met.</p>

<p>The conditions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a licence may be granted for the import of military goods if the import is necessary for the maintenance and safety of existing capability within the UK</li>
  <li>a licence may be granted for the import of: Hydrazine (CAS 302-01-2) in concentrations of 70% or more, or Monomethyl hydrazine (CAS 60-34-4) if it is for:
    <ul>
      <li>use in launchers operated by UK service providers</li>
      <li>use in launches by the European Space Agency or UK space programmes</li>
      <li>or the fuelling of satellites by UK satellites manufacturers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a licence may be granted for the import of unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (CAS 57-14-7) if it is for:
    <ul>
      <li>use in launchers operated by UK launch service providers</li>
      <li>use in launches by the European Space Agency or UK space programmes</li>
      <li>or the fuelling of satellites by UK satellites manufacturers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a licence may be granted for the import of hydrazine (CAS 302-01-2) in concentrations of 70% or more for the tests and flight of ExoMars descent module and for the flight of ExoMars carrier module in the framework of the ExoMars 2020 mission</li>
</ul>

<p>A licence may be issued for the import, acquisition, supply or delivery, directly or indirectly, of finished steel and articles of iron and steel products (as specified in Schedule 3B to the Russia Sanctions Regulations) if it relates to the execution of obligations arising from contracts concluded before 14 April 2022. This is provided the actions carried out under these contracts are completed by 17 June 2022.</p>

<h2>Enforcement of trade sanctions</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2/contents" rel="external">Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (<abbr title="Customs and Excise Management Act">CEMA</abbr>)</a> makes it a criminal offence to contravene the trade sanctions. Some breaches of the import sanctions prohibitions are triable either way and carry a maximum sentence on indictment of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both). Under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/855/regulation/80/made" rel="external">regulation 80 of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019</a>, this maximum sentence has been modified to 10 years’ imprisonment. Any breach of the trade licensing provisions or information requirements in connection with general trade licences is also triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 2 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both). Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2/part/IV" rel="external">part 4 of the <abbr title="Customs and Excise Management Act">CEMA</abbr></a> for further details.</p>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) is responsible for enforcing the licensing restrictions and investigating suspected offences.</p>

<p>If you discover that you have breached any of the trade prohibitions or licensing provisions, you should report the irregularity to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> (sometimes known as ‘voluntary disclosure’) as soon as possible.</p>
