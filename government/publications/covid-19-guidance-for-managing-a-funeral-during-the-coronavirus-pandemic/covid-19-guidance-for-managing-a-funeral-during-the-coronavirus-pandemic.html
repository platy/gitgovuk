<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect changes in the new Government response to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-living-with-covid-19">living with coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> announced on the 21 February 2022. There is no longer a legal requirement for people with COVID-19 infection to self-isolate. Attending a funeral or commemorative event may present a higher risk of spreading COVID-19. This guidance contains updated advice to reduce this risk, especially for people at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell from COVID-19 including those with a severely weakened immune system.</p>

<p>In line with changes made on 24 February 2022, all legal restrictions have been removed from this guidance, including the previous requirements to isolate and exemptions in relationship to attending a funeral. In order to protect those at higher risk from severe COVID-19, this guidance now includes up to date advice for testing, wearing face coverings, increasing ventilation, limiting close contact and maintaining respiratory and hand hygiene.</p>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>It is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>members of the public who may be attending a funeral or commemorative event</li>
  <li>members of the public who may be involved in arranging a funeral or commemorative event</li>
  <li>professionals who may be involved in arranging or managing a funeral or commemorative event</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of this guidance, the phrase ‘commemorative event’ includes events and rituals such as stone setting ceremonies, the scattering of ashes and wakes. Such events may take place before or following the funeral.</p>

<p>It is important to take steps to protect yourselves and others from COVID-19. This is particularly true for funerals, where the risk of COVID-19 may be higher. This increased risk may be from the close contact between grieving loved ones, friends and family, and also when people meet in enclosed spaces.</p>

<p>Anyone who has the main symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature or a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell), should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a>.</p>

<p>For further information and the actions to take to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19, refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">guidance on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>.</p>

<h2>Key actions for those attending, arranging or managing a funeral or commemorative event</h2>

<p>The risk of catching and passing on COVID-19 can be reduced by good ventilation (such as by letting fresh air in), meeting outside, wearing face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces and washing your hands and following advice to ‘Catch it, Bin it, Kill it’.</p>

<p>Consider taking a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before attending the funeral to help manage the risk to yourself and those around you. This may be especially important if there will be people who are at a higher risk from COVID-19 present at the funeral.</p>

<p>If the test is positive, follow the advice below. There is more information on rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests available.</p>

<p>Guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">Working Safely during Coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> will continue until the end of March 2022. From 1 April, although COVID-19 specific requirements will be lifted, employers will still have a legal duty to manage general risks. They should do this by undertaking a health and safety risk assessment, and to take reasonable steps to mitigate these risks.</p>

<p>The guidance below outlines actions to take when attending, arranging or managing a funeral, or commemorative event.</p>

<h2>Stay at home if you have the main COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test result</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement for people with COVID-19 to self-isolate, however if you have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19, you should order a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. You are advised to stay at home, avoid contact with other people, and follow the guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts while you wait for your test result. stay at home and avoid contact with other people.</p>

<p>If you have COVID-19 you can infect other people from 2 days before your symptoms start, and for up to 10 days after. You can pass on the infection to others, even if you have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. If you have COVID-19 the public health advice is to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. You should follow the guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts.</p>

<p>Funerals and commemorative events are very meaningful and important events to attend. If you have COVID-19 and you need to leave your home to attend a funeral or commemorative event while you are still infectious, you can take steps to reduce the chance of passing on the infection to others:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wear a well-fitting face covering made with multiple layers or a surgical face mask.</li>
  <li>Avoid close contact with anyone you know who is at <a class="govuk-link" href="#HigherRisk">higher risk of becoming severely unwell</a> if they are infected with COVID-19.</li>
  <li>Avoid crowds during the funeral or commemorative event, or anywhere that is poorly ventilated or enclosed.</li>
  <li>Limit close contact with other people outside your household as much as possible. Try and keep outside and stay at least 2 metres apart from them.</li>
  <li>Be especially careful with your hand and respiratory hygiene.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you live with, or have stayed overnight in the household of, someone who has COVID-19, or have been notified that you are a close contact, follow the advice in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">guidance for people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a>.</p>

<h2>Consider limiting close contact</h2>

<p>Limiting close contact during funerals and commemorative events helps to reduce the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19.</p>

<p>It is important to consider that others attending a funeral or a commemorate event may wish to take a more cautious approach. We should all be considerate of this and provide the opportunity and space for others to reduce close contacts if they wish.</p>

<h2>People who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19</h2>

<p>Some people are still at higher risk of severe illness if they are infected with COVID-19  especially those with a severely weakened immune system. If you are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 you may wish to think carefully about the particular risks associated with attending a funeral.</p>

<p>For those arranging or managing a funeral or commemorative event, if you become aware that someone who is at higher risk of becoming severely unwell with COVID-19 will be attending, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>try and enable them to participate remotely where this is possible (for example by live-streaming) should they wish to do so</li>
  <li>consider reminding other attendees that there are individuals who may choose or need to maintain distancing – it is important that you don’t identify, or single anyone out, or release personal or confidential information</li>
</ul>

<h2>Religious or other belief-based practices that may involve close contact with the deceased</h2>

<p>Where it is not possible to determine if COVID-19 was suspected or confirmed at the time of death, you are not advised to take part in rituals or practices that bring you in close contact with the deceased. There is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from body fluids and tissues where COVID-19 infection is suspected or confirmed.</p>

<p>If aspects of faith or beliefs include close contact with the deceased, you should wear personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) under the supervision of someone who is trained in the appropriate use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased">guidance on care of the deceased</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, it is not advisable for people who may be at higher risk to have any contact at all with the body of the deceased, especially those with a severely weakened immune system – even if they are fully vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Experiencing grief or bereavement</h2>

<p>The loss of a friend or loved one can be an extremely difficult time, which has been made even more challenging throughout the pandemic. Grief affects everyone in different ways, and it is important that you have the right support to help you with bereavement and grief.</p>

<p>There is a range of support available, including through the NHS, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cruse.org.uk/" rel="external">Cruse Bereavement Care</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ataloss.org/" rel="external">AtaLoss</a>, which provides signposting and services across the UK.</p>

<p>If you are supporting a bereaved child or young person, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://childhoodbereavementnetwork.org.uk/" rel="external">Childhood Bereavement Network</a> has information and links to national and local organisations.</p>
