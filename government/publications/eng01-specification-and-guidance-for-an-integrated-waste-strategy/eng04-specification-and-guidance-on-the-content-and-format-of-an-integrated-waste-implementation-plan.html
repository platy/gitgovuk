<span class="number">1. </span>Preface</h2>

<p>This document provides the specification and guidance for an Integrated Waste Implementation Plan (<abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr>). This will retain and build upon the fundamental elements of the specification and guidance for an Integrated Waste Strategy (<abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>) to ensure that plans for implementation of the strategy are developed and documented. The production of an <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will help to facilitate the integrated management of waste across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate by identifying opportunities, dependencies and synergies, and scope for collaboration across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate and the wider nuclear sector.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will ensure that there is a clear thread from Her Majesty’s Government (HMG) and Devolved Administrations (DA) policies, through <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and site waste strategies, to the implementation of site waste management plans. Such a thread will enable the beneficial development of each to be influenced by the other, facilitated by a clear flow of information between relevant stakeholders and authorities. This enables Site License Companies (SLCs) to actively influence the future decision-making process, providing a clearer understanding and visibility to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> of the current and future site/estate needs.</p>

<p>It is recognised that much of the requested information may already be available elsewhere within site documentation (e.g. extant <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>), hence the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> may “signpost” relevant information that has been produced for other purposes. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will provide a narrative to describe ongoing and future planned work to implement that strategy, as well as identifying relevant risks and opportunities, both site and estate wide.</p>

<p>This specification describes the aims of an <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> and provides guidance on what it should include and how it should be used. The specification is intentionally non-prescriptive. Instead, it builds on first principles, considering what a combined strategic and planning document should be and what it should include. SLCs are encouraged to utilise their <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>/strategic arrangements to develop their <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> and make best use of any existing documents and processes, where possible.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>This document provides the specification and guidance for an Integrated Waste Implementation Plan (<abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr>). The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> retains and builds upon the fundamental elements of the Integrated Waste Strategy (<abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>), as was the focus of the earlier (2012) version of ENG01 and ensures that plans for implementation of the strategy are developed and documented (Figure 1). The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should be consistent with the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr> and the two may be combined to enable a consolidated presentation of the strategic and implementation planning aspects.</p>

<p>The overall purpose of the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> is to facilitate and promote better waste management both at the site level and across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate by achieving several subordinate aims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To ensure there is a clear link between Her Majesty’s Government (HMG) and Devolved Administrations policies, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and site waste strategies, and the implementation of site waste management plans. Thereby, to enable the development of each to be influenced by the others in a flow of information between relevant stakeholders and authorities</li>
  <li>To enable a clearer demonstration of how <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> is being implemented and its alignment with the Integrated Waste Management principles</li>
  <li>To facilitate <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>’s own planning and prioritisation and to provide <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> with clear evidence of progress in the implementation of its programme</li>
  <li>To provide <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and HMG with clear up-to-date information upon the current position regarding waste management across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate</li>
  <li>To act as a coherent, transparent strategic stakeholder communication tool</li>
  <li>To inform <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> IWM Strategy, and better coordinate waste management activities and plans across the estate by early identification &amp; implementation of programmes, projects, initiatives, needs, risks, opportunities and synergies</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recognised that much of the requested information may already be available elsewhere within site documentation, hence the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> can “signpost” this information such that it is easily identifiable and collatable. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should provide a narrative to describe ongoing and future work activities to deliver the strategy, and to identify relevant risks and opportunities.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> approach embraces the IWM principles and should demonstrate how these principles are being applied, such as how the Waste Hierarchy is being enacted and how “wider UK strategic initiatives” are followed and implemented. It also reflects stakeholder views and experiences, including practitioner learning relating to the creation, value and effectiveness of an <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>. These views were captured from a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats” (<abbr title="Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats">SWOT</abbr>) exercise undertaken with Site License Companies (SLCs) and regulatory bodies and development of this specification and guidance document has been informed by stakeholder workshops – the ‘<abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr> Specification Replacement 1st and 2nd Project Workshops’, held virtually in December 2021 and February 2022, respectively.</p>

<p>The Integrated Waste Management principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Supporting key risk and hazard reduction initiatives by enabling a flexible approach to long-term waste management.</li>
  <li>Taking into consideration the entire waste management lifecycle, including how it supports other <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> or wider UK strategic initiatives, such as large-scale decommissioning programme.</li>
  <li>Applying the Waste Hierarchy, which is recognised as good practice and should enable an effective balance of priorities in waste management decisions, including value for money, affordability, technical maturity, and the protection of health, safety of the environment.</li>
  <li>Promoting timely characterisation and segregation of waste, which underpins effective waste management from the outset.</li>
  <li>Where appropriate, provide leadership by encouraging greater integration across the estate and supply chain, in particular by seeking opportunities to share treatment facilities, interim storage assets, capabilities and learning.</li>
  <li>Supporting and promoting the use of robust decision-making processes to identify the best options for waste management.</li>
  <li>Enabling the availability of sustainable, robust infrastructure for continued operations, hazard reduction and decommissioning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Scope</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should consider all wastes as defined in the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>’s IWM Strategy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, including non-radioactive wastes. It should demonstrate how the Integrated Waste Management principles are being implemented in practice. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should address all currently foreseen waste management activities up to end of mission by setting out the facilities and plants that are required to manage waste through the lifecycle (i.e. through construction, operation, decommissioning, treatment, storage and disposal phases). The approach should be at a level that considers broad classes of waste, rather than providing a focus on individual waste categories. High levels of confidence can be expressed for elements of the implementation plan in the relative short-term (e.g. where these reflect current operations or activities that are at an advanced state of preparation for implementation). Longer-term plans, such as final disposal of wastes to facilities that may not yet exist, are subject to greater levels of uncertainty and this should be recognised. An <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should be site specific but should consider and capture opportunities for shared resources and cross-site collaboration.</p>

<p>Where possible, the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should identify Specific, Measurable, Achievable (or Attainable), Realistic and Time-bound (<abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable (or Attainable), Realistic and Time-bound)">SMART</abbr>) objectives related to waste management at the site. This can be a simple “signpost” to where such information already exists within current arrangements. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should contain a narrative clearly setting out the site’s waste management planning and should identify opportunities, risks, gaps (e.g. lack of characterisation data), uncertainties and any dependencies (e.g. wider UK strategic initiatives, availability of storage capacity or disposal facility).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Process and use</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will inform <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>’s waste coordination process which seeks to involve relevant stakeholders and authorities to consider potential synergies and opportunities, and to identify risks so that these can be mitigated. Dialogue around the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will give sites the opportunity to share challenges and ensure that their specific needs are properly discussed and prioritised across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate, and to enable information to be shared and opportunities for collaboration to be explored. By this process, sites will ensure that the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> is fully aware of their future needs, which can aid the development of business cases. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will be used to appropriately inform <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy, and an update to align with and inform the next iteration of the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy should be planned, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitor-evaluate">Monitoring and evaluating</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is intended that the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will be co-ordinated with relevant technology developments at the site. Technological opportunities for improved waste management should be identified and considered as part of the implementation plan, if applicable.</p>

<p>The advantage to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> will be better coordination and management of waste across its estate by maximising opportunities to share resources and to provide a fuller overall picture of the state of waste management across its sites. This will provide the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> with a greater understanding of future requirements, which in turn will enable the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to make better informed decisions. The clear identification of site <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable (or Attainable), Realistic and Time-bound)">SMART</abbr> objectives will help demonstrate progress with the core mission of site clean-up. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> process flow diagram is presented in Figure 2.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Implementing an Integrated Waste Strategy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Strategic aspects</h3>

<p>A site-specific <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr> should be aligned with the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> and, ideally, incorporated within it so that the site’s waste strategy and the plans to implement it are consistent and clear. The strategic elements should fundamentally align to, and be consistent with, the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy, or should explain and justify any deviations from this, where applicable. At its core, an <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr> should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be forward looking, outlining the overall mission, vision and the short-, medium- and long-term objectives for managing waste at the site in accordance with the Lifetime Plan (<abbr title="Lifetime Plan)">LTP</abbr>);</li>
  <li>Set out the objectives in such a way that both the aims and the reason(s) behind them are clear;</li>
  <li>Set out how the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy is being implemented, which should identify and explain any differences and/or deviations, where applicable;</li>
  <li>Detail the <abbr title="Site Licence Company)">SLC</abbr>’s integrated and optimised approach to managing the full range of waste they generate; to achieve strategic goals (for waste, to complete mission);</li>
  <li>Include a description of the outcomes of any strategic options study (or studies), RWMCs &amp; disposability cases informing the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>;</li>
  <li>Recognise the key constraints and the impact these have on the shaping of the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>; and,</li>
  <li>Describe the general journey the site will take towards achieving its objectives, from “where we are” to “where we want to be”.</li>
</ul>

<p>An account should be provided of the outcomes of any optioneering that has been undertaken in support of the site strategy development. This should demonstrate an optimised approach to managing the full range of waste. Optioneering guidance is provided by both the regulators and the nuclear industry, including: 
- the Environment Agency’s Regulatory Guidance Series<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>
- the joint guidance on the production of Radioactive Waste Management Cases<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>
- the nuclear industry code of practice on identifying and implementing ‘Best Available Techniques<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Interaction with other strategies, plans and deliverables</h3>

<p>Figure 2 is essentially a high-level process flow diagram showing the interactions between policy, strategy and implementation planning. The value of this process will be in the flow of information to identify opportunities, enabling SLCs to actively influence the future <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> strategy development process. This flow of information will provide benefits to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and stakeholders, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#intro">introduction</a>. Notably, it will help enable the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to better forecast/predict the current and future needs of the estate and help to facilitate engagement with HMG and the Devolved Administrations, and may ultimately influence policy.</p>

<p>The site <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should identify innovative opportunities for managing waste that are set out in the site’s technology development programme, potentially utilising the Technology Baseline and Underpinning Research and Development documents (TBuRDs) and associated Technical Readiness Levels (TRLs) if applicable. This will reflect technologies that are conceptual (low technical readiness) and represent opportunities focussed on long-term goals, and more mature technologies (high technical readiness) that are anticipated for deployment in the near term or can be applied with high confidence at any stage during the mission.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> sits within an array of other strategies and documents. Figure 3 illustrates the typical interfaces and relationships and shows the thread from policy, through national strategy, to waste producer implementation. Notably, the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> may draw upon information that sits in other documentation and can signpost to this rather than recreating it. For example, in response to regulatory requirements<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> sites are required to produce a Waste Management Plan (<abbr title="Waste Management Plan">WMP</abbr>) that is consistent with a Site-Wide Environmental Safety Case (<abbr title="Site-Wide Environmental Safety Case">SWESC</abbr>). There may be useful elements of the <abbr title="Waste Management Plan">WMP</abbr> that can inform the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr>, and vice versa.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Illustrative relationship of the IWIP to policy, strategy and implementation level documentation " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/159588/Illustrative_relationship_of_the_IWIP_to_policy__strategy_and_implementation_level_documentation.jpg"></div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Implementation planning</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> sets out how the site/operator implements an <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr> aligned to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy and the site strategy through an executable plan. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> needs to address how the strategy is to be delivered until the end of the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>’s mission at the site. However, the focus of the plan should be on those types of wastes being managed actively at the tactical level through current operations and during the next few years, with longer-term elements of the plan identified as being of a more strategic nature and thus subject to greater uncertainty (such as those aspects contingent on the availability and timing of treatment, storage and disposal routes that are not currently available). The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should facilitate a clear flow of information, thereby enabling the strategic and planning elements to influence each other.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should make appropriate use of current arrangements and documentation and need only “signpost” existing documentation that provides relevant details (i.e. there is no expectation or requirement to produce vast new documentation where existing site arrangements can provide the necessary underpinning). The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should be compact and include a concise narrative that identifies the current position and any future risks or opportunities. The level of detail should be such as to enable the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to measure the site’s progress in delivering the strategy, but most importantly should be capable of facilitating the early identification of site-specific and estate-wide opportunities, risks and any potential synergies.</p>

<p>At its core, the plan should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a description of the planned lifecycle management of each type of waste consistent with the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Strategy">IWS</abbr>. One approach would be to show how plans align with the phases of the waste management lifecycle, inclusive of planning/optioneering, characterisation, retrieval, conditioning, storage, disposal stages. The use of illustrative charts/timelines/diagrams is encouraged, as is making use of existing documentation or arrangements that provide the underpinning detail;</li>
  <li>Provide a narrative to accompany the identified activities within the plan in sufficient detail to describe the intent and any associated risks, opportunities and potential synergies;</li>
  <li>Identify required infrastructure (e.g. waste conditioning plant, storage infrastructure, treatment routes etc.) and supporting regulatory permissions to enable utilisation;</li>
  <li>Provide currently anticipated indicative timescales with any dependencies upon assumptions (e.g. presumed dates of Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) and/or other disposal route availability);</li>
  <li>Reflect on the level of confidence/uncertainty regarding the delivery of the plan – greatest confidence in near-term (as per the Near-Term Work Plan (<abbr title="Near Term Work Plan)">NTWP</abbr>) and funding round), compared to longer-term elements, which are likely to be subject to much greater uncertainty;</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should identify required technological developments, where relevant, and consider the associated Technology Readiness Levels (<abbr title="Technology Readiness Level">TRL</abbr>); and,</li>
  <li>Where applicable (such as shorter-term goals), the above elements should be articulated and demonstrated using <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable (or Attainable), Realistic and Time-bound)">SMART</abbr> objectives.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Assumptions</h3>

<p>Any assumptions underpinning strategic aspects and implementation plans should be explicitly set out. Such assumptions could be categorised as generic (e.g. the date of GDF availability), or site specific (e.g. a specific store is designed and built with regulatory permission by a given date). Ideally information should be provided in tabular form.</p>

<p>Key dependencies should also be outlined (e.g. reliance on funding provision, plant throughput, national infrastructure availability, stakeholder &amp; regulatory acceptance, technology availability and readiness etc.)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Risks, Uncertainties and Opportunities</h3>

<p>A systematic compilation of risks, uncertainties and opportunities (including synergies and potential areas for collaboration across individual sites, SLCs &amp; the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Group) should be provided. This should explicitly set out those key risks and uncertainties that are generic (e.g. disposal routes not available and hence longer-term storage required) and those that are more detailed and site specific (e.g. an assumed technology that has been identified for implementation as a waste treatment route at a site may not be mature enough by the proposed deployment date assumed in the plan).</p>

<p>Opportunities should be set out, particularly those identifying estate-wide dependencies/synergies and scope for collaboration with other sites (e.g. where the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate would benefit from shared waste storage facility or waste treatment infrastructure, potential re-use of stores upon commencement of disposal etc.) Such opportunities should not be limited to those that are currently achievable, but should consider potential future possibilities as a goal to drive continuous improvement as outlined in the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy (e.g. novel waste treatments or novel disposal options).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> states that it, “…….is to make more use of a risk informed approach, rather than rely on the simple classification-based system for waste management and to seek solutions that help to optimise the lifecycle of both radioactive and non-radioactive wastes.” Each site’s <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> document will need to demonstrate a risk informed approach. It should explain how waste risk management is conducted and it should describe how risks are linked to the delivery of specific waste management objectives and outcomes. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should indicate where a risk informed approach has affected waste management implementation at the site level, as well as where there are risks to the identified plan, e.g. lack of funding, achieving construction to an assumed timescale etc.</p>

<p>In order to maximise the value from <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> investments into R&amp;D and innovation, the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should cross-reference any identified waste management technology opportunities and consider these for incorporation into the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr>. Technologies with lower TRLs or lead times beyond the life of the current <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should be identified as a potential future (but not scheduled) waste management option. This will assist the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> in prioritising and funding their R&amp;D and innovation programmes, as well as reporting where such programmes have benefitted site programmes.</p>

<p>It could be beneficial to consolidate and present all information responding to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#assumptions">assumptions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#risks-uncertainties-opportunities">risks, uncertainties and opportunities</a> in a succinct tabular form where possible.</p>

<p>To extract further value from site IWIPs, particularly in identifying risks, uncertainties and opportunities at both site and estate level, an IWM Topic Overview Group (TOG) meeting will provide an platform and forum with a specific <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> focus. This will enable discussion of real-time risks and opportunities and ensure a flow of information between SLCs, the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and other TOG participants. Such information exchanges will inform a national IWM risks and opportunities register held/owned by <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Communication and consultation</h3>

<p>The production and presentation of the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will be part of a wider communication and consultation process that will strengthen and improve communication between SLCs, the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>, regulators and stakeholders on integrated waste matters. This will be further facilitated by information exchange at dedicated fora established by the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>. This approach is integral to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy and consistent with the “One <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>” ways of working to maximise synergies and collaboration across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> group to help ensure effective and efficient delivery of the mission. The fora will be an opportunity to ensure awareness of plans and to discuss cross-site technologies, risks and programme opportunities, e.g. especially those that require significant future decisions, large initiatives, or sanction of timely funding.</p>

<p>The sharing and discussion of plans to incorporate technologies identified for development will enable other sites to potentially consider such opportunities for similar wastes, or for an agreed prototype testing schedule to be developed where one or more sites deliver and improve a technology before other sites incorporate that technology into their <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> also provides an opportunity for communication and consultation with the regulators. Ideally, this should commence at the earliest practicable stage of development of the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> to identify any key regulatory issues or concerns for specific sites and to minimise regulatory risk. Regulators should be made aware of the aims and objectives set out in the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> and the systems of integrated waste management which will deliver them.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> can be used to help ensure that decision makers and stakeholders are informed as plans develop to maturity and hence to avoid surprises. Production of an accessible <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> summary, such as a poster or pamphlet aimed at non-technical audiences, would help inform internal and external stakeholders of the site’s waste management objectives and current progress against these. This could ensure transparency, improve stakeholder confidence and trust, and promote a collective awareness of site level plans towards <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> mission delivery.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Monitoring and evaluation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Demonstrating Progress</h3>

<p>Measuring progress in strategy implementation is an important aspect to enable <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to demonstrate value for money. An <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will need to ensure that progress in implementing the plan is measurable using appropriate metrics (indicators), milestones aligned to specific implementation phases and overall a consideration of developing and utilising a high-level action plan. Examples could include the amount of waste conditioned versus a target for an operational plant, having optioneering outcomes in place to inform waste management decisions, achieving regulatory permissioning by a given date, and obtaining endorsements through the “Disposability Assessment Process”. <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable (or Attainable), Realistic and Time-bound)">SMART</abbr> objectives should be identified where appropriate.</p>

<p>Where relevant site metrics currently exist, these should be clearly signposted in the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> together with an associated description to ensure clarity. The use of a dashboard-based approach would be welcomed if appropriately defined and supported by sufficient narrative to be understandable to an external audience.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Review Cycle</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> should set out a timescale for review and update. All aspects of the strategy and implementation planning should be revisited on appropriate timescales, including the key objectives. Under routine circumstances a three-year review and update cycle should be considered for an <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr>, although detailed aspects of the implementation plan are likely to be “live” (Figure 4: Review cycles/periods.). Aspects of the implementation plan are likely to be subject to more frequent, routine change consistent with the delivery focus and vulnerability to factors such as plant availability and outages. Strategic aspects are unlikely to change as frequently. The <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> will be considered annually in a dedicated <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> forum and this may prompt a limited annual review and update. As a minimum, an update should align with the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy production process (a five-year cycle) and enable appropriate dialogue.</p>

<p>It is foreseeable that events (both internal and external) may render aspects of the strategy and implementation plans out of date. In the event of a major strategic change, a revision and realignment of the <abbr title="Integrated Waste Implementation Plan">IWIP</abbr> would be needed and SLCs may be required to progress revisions to align with changes to the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Strategy. An example of a major strategic change could be the adoption of near-surface disposal for selected <abbr title="Higher Activity Waste">HAW</abbr>, as opposed to disposal in the GDF.</p>
