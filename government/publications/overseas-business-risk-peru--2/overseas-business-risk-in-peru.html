<p>OVERSEAS BUSINESS RISK - PERU
February 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Overview</h2>

<p>Peru was one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America between 2002 and 2013, driven by sound fiscal and monetary policies and by growth in services, mining, and manufacturing.  Between 2014 and 2019 growth slowed to an average of 3.1%, mainly due to lower commodity prices and a slowdown in private investment.  The Covid 19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on Peru’s economy, with GDP decreasing by 11.1% in 2020. In 2021 the economy surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with a growth of 13.3%. The outlook for 2022, however, is forecasted to be between 2 to 3%.</p>

<p>Politically, the last five years have been unstable, with five Presidents holding office since 2016. Socially conservative and hard-leftist Pedro Castillo unexpectedly passed to the runoff elections in July 2021 and obtained a narrow victory over right-wing Keiko Fujimori (daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori), who alleged the results were fraudulent. The elections were recognised as largely free and fair by international observers and governments (including the UK), and Pedro Castillo was sworn in as President on 28 July 2021.</p>

<p>In early February 2022, President Castillo appointed his fourth cabinet in less than seven months. The Prime Minister is former Justice Minister Aníbal Torres, who leads a cabinet comprised mostly of members linked to the government party, hard left Perú Libre. The cabinet needs an approbatory investiture vote from Congress, which is currently pending (mid- February 2022). Some of the right-wing groups in Congress are calling for the President’s resignation or removal. We expect further political instability in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Peru faces several domestic challenges. The Covid-19 pandemic and political turmoil in recent years have exacerbated institutional challenges that limit the delivery of public policies. The human rights situation is complex, with high levels of gender-based violence, and socio-environmental defenders and investigative journalists at risk. In mid- January 2022, the government declared a climate emergency after an oil spill off the coast of Lima- dubbed the worst ecological disaster in the country’s history.</p>

<p>Peru was one of the countries that was worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic during its first wave and ranked among the top 5 worldwide in terms of total COVID-19 cases and mortality rates. A third wave caused by Omicron is retreating. The government’s vaccination campaign has progressed rapidly and vaccine provision is largely secured for 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Political analysis</h2>

<p>Peru is a constitutional democratic republic with a multi-party system. Under the current constitution of 1993, the President is the Head of State and government, elected for a five-year period, without the possibility of running for immediate re-election. The President designates the Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet. There is a 130-member unicameral Congress elected for a five-year period, with a one term limit. Bills may be proposed either by the Executive or by the Legislative Branches, and they become law after being passed through Congress and enacted by the President. The Judiciary and the National Electoral Board are independent institutions. The Peruvian Government is directly elected, and voting is compulsory for all citizens between the ages of 18 and 70.</p>

<p>Recent political history has been characterised by instability. Former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (elected in 2016) resigned in 2018 on corruption allegations, and his Vice-President Martin Vizcarra was removed on similar grounds in 2020. Violent clashes between citizens and the police in November 2020 following Vizcarra’s removal saw Speaker of Congress Manuel Merino step down after only a week as interim President. Congressman Francisco Sagasti, was then sworn in as interim President to lead the country through general elections in April and a government transition in July 2021.</p>

<p>The April 2021 General Elections took place in unprecedented circumstances, with a country shaken by simultaneous political, economic and sanitary crises. Voter preferences had been historically fragmented, with five presidential candidates in a technical tie only a week before the election. The result of the first electoral round saw hard left Pedro Castillo and right- wing Keiko Fujimori (daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori) pass to the runoff, with only 18,9% and 13,4% of the votes respectively. Castillo obtained a marginal (~44,000 votes) over Fujimori, who alleged the results were fraudulent. The elections were recognised as largely free and fair by international observers and governments (including the UK).</p>

<p>An elementary school teacher and unionist in the mining region of Cajamarca, Castillo led a 3-month long teacher strike in 2017 that ultimately brought about the downfall of the education minister. The founder of Castillo’s party Perú Libre, former regional governor Vladimir Cerrón, was prohibited from running as Second Vice-President due to a corruption sentence. Perú Libre’s manifesto advocates for a new constitution and a fundamental restructuring of the economy. It commits to nationalising strategic resources, including the extractive industries, and to taking Peru out of international trade agreements. However, it is unlikely that President Castillo’s left-wing cabinet will be able to push the most radical policy proposals through Congress, as a majority of the 10 parties represented the legislature are centre-right.</p>

<p>President Castillo’s first seven months in office have been unstable. HIs first cabinet was led by hard left Perú Libre Congressman Guido Bellido, who was replaced after only two months by human rights lawyer Mirtha Vásquez. She resigned in protest at the President’s failure to address endemic corruption in early February 2022. Congressman and lawyer Héctor Valer was briefly appointed in her place but resigned after three days following widespread criticism in mainstream and social media against him for alleged domestic violence.</p>

<p>The fourth ministerial cabinet since August 2021 is led by lawyer and former Justice Minister Aníbal Torres, who leads a cabinet comprised mostly of members linked to the government party, hard left Perú Libre. The cabinet needs an approbatory investiture vote from Congress, which is currently pending (mid- February 2022).</p>

<p>The majority of the 10 parties represented in Congress are centre-right, although voting patterns do not necessarily follow traditional party lines. Some of the right-wing groups in Congress are calling for the President’s resignation or removal.</p>

<p>Current contentious issues include back-peddling on education reforms aimed at improving teaching quality as well as promoting gender equality, and of much-needed public transport reforms. A proposal for a tax reform has been criticised by the business sector who consider it counterproductive to post-pandemic economic reactivation. The government is also dealing with the impact of an oil spill (~11,00 barrels) that happened on 15 January 2022 off the coast of Lima- deemed one of the largest ecological disasters in the country’s history.</p>

<p>There was widespread support in Congress for a reversal of a political reform aimed at strengthening political parties ahead of the regional and local elections due in October 2022. It is likely that Peru will continue to face political instability in the coming months.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Economic analysis</h2>

<h4>Macro</h4>

<p>Peru is an upper middle-income country whose GDP amounts to S/. 712 billion (US$ 204 billion) and was one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America between 2002 and 2013, driven by sound fiscal and monetary policies and by growth in services, mining, and manufacturing. Between 2014 and 2019, growth slowed to an average of 3.1%, mainly due to lower commodity prices and a slowdown in private investment.</p>

<p>The country’s main economic drivers are the services, commerce, manufacturing and mining sectors – they alone encompass roughly 80% of GDP. These have remained mostly unchanged in the last decade, with mining exports – joined increasingly by the agro-industrial sector– being the main contributor for economic development as Peru is a primary goods exporter for metals like copper, silver and gold, with the UK as the largest foreign investor in projects, due to mining (US$ 12 billion). On the latter, private investment is a significant driver of GDP, representing roughly 80% of total investment.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on Peru’s economy, which shrunk by 11.1% in 2020 as the result of an extended mandatory lockdown. This event led to regression in socio-economic indicators such as poverty rates, which rose to 30.1%, from 20.2%, and extreme poverty almost doubled (from 2.9% to 5.1%). Likewise, underemployment increased to 58% – with unemployment at 7% – and informality remained at the very high level of 75%. The number of micro and small companies (MYPE), which represented 99% of all companies before the pandemic, shrunk by almost 50%.</p>

<p>In 2021 the economy surpassed pre-pandemic levels, expanding 13.3% and leading all countries in South America. However, when compared to 2019 – to isolate the statistical effect – growth drops to 0.8%. Moreover, looking closely at the outlook for 2022, it is evident that the base year factor hides significant weakness. Although the Ministry of Finance is estimating an optimistic year on year growth of 3.5 to 4% in 2022, the Central Bank’s forecast is more cautious at 3.4%, with null growth for private investment, and analysts’ consensus lower still, averaging around 2.5%, roughly 2 percentage points lower than world growth (IMF prediction). This against the backdrop of a slowdown in investor confidence, as measured by the Central Bank’s 3-month and 12-month business confidence indicators, which fell 19.5% and 25.9% last year since the first round of the Presidential election (April-December). As such, in the first week of September, Moody’s downgraded Peru’s long-term foreign-currency rating one notch to ‘Baa1’ from ‘A3’. Fitch followed in October, downgrading Peru from ‘BBB+’ to ‘BBB’, and S&amp;P revised its outlook from stable to negative reflecting a possible downgrade from ‘BBB+’ in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Regarding economic policy, the government speech has been divided in three pillars: the social front; investment and sectoral; as well as technology and climate action. There have been key announcements regarding new investment in health infrastructure (US$ 600 million), regional investment projects linked to the Second Agrarian Reform, energy transitioning to renewables, and the need for immediate climate action to accelerate adaptation and mitigation, as well as to reduce deforestation. All of this while referencing the need to expand and optimize public contracting, incorporate comprehensive project management, and promote digital transformation and innovation.</p>

<h4>Mining</h4>

<p>The mining sector in Peru has been an essential driver of growth over the last 20 years. It represents 63% of exports and roughly 9% of GDP and, although, it is more capital intensive, it generates significant formal employment through its close linkage to services and non-primary manufacturing.</p>

<p>Peru’s project portfolio is composed of 11 countries, with the UK being the largest foreign investor (US$ 12 billion), closely followed by China (US$ 10.1 billion) and Canada (US$ 8.4 billion). As of now, Peru has close to 50 mining projects under development, with a value of roughly US$ 60 billion worth of investments (71% allocated to copper).</p>

<p>New mining projects will come on stream in 2022, elevating copper production in 20% to 2023. These are Anglo American’s Quellaveco, Mina Justa, and the extension of Toromocho. Others also expected to start this year are Yanacocha Sulfuros and Magistral. Given that copper prices should remain at an all-time high due to limited supply (of projects worldwide) and high demand, with structural medium-term support, the analysts’ consensus forecast is significantly optimistic for 2022. The mining sector in Peru grew 8.9% (to November) in 2021 and is expected to grow roughly 6.5% in 2022.</p>

<h4>Infrastructure</h4>

<p>In terms of access, the long-term (20 years) estimated infrastructure gap is US$ 110 billion, while the referential level of investment to close the infrastructure gap in terms of quality is US$ 180 billion. In summary, Peru’s total long-term infrastructure gap (access plus quality) is US$ 290 billion, almost 1.5 times the country’s GDP. There is still much to do in terms of creating a structural strategic framework with priorities per sector and region, under budget guidelines and restrictions (the National Infrastructure Plan was an important stepping-stone). Many of the most relevant infrastructure projects have stalled due to rigidity in the national infrastructure system’s process and legal framework.</p>

<p>Thus, one key part of Peru’s economic recovery plan to support growth involves the delivery of several major infrastructure projects, which include Lima Metro Line 2, the Central Highway and the Lima Airport expansion.</p>

<p>Likewise, the government announced four PPP and asset-related projects to be tendered by ProInversion during 2022, for roughly US$ 1.3 billion, added to Essalud (US$ 280 million) high complexity hospitals, which recently called for investors. There was no mention of other mature PPP projects which are part of the National Infrastructure Plan.</p>

<p>In 2020, the UK signed a Government-to-Government Agreement to advise on the delivery of part of Peru’s Reconstruction Programme, to rebuild schools and hospitals and improve flood defence infrastructure in northern Peru following widespread flooding in 2017. The implementation of these projects has offered numerous opportunities for the local market, as contractors need not only local workforce and heavy machinery but also consultancy services. For 2022, the government will implement a similar scheme for the Central Highway and projects in education – the bicentennial schools (now also subject to a UK/Peru G2G agreement) – and possibly health, with planned investments of US$ 600 million.</p>

<h4>Trade</h4>

<p>Peru’s trade policy is liberal as Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) cover more than 92% of trade. The UK-Andean Trade Agreement covers trade between the UK and Peru, which includes provisions on goods, services, intellectual property and government procurement.</p>

<p>Peru is one of the four countries in the Pacific Alliance and a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), for which the UK has formally applied to join. It is also a member of the WTO, Andean Community and APEC.</p>

<p>As such, Peru is the second largest silver, copper and zinc producer and the sixth largest gold producer in the world. Non-traditional exports, led by the agricultural sector – with products like grapes, avocados, mangos, asparagus, blueberries, and bananas, amongst others – surpassed the US$ 16 billion-mark in 2021, boosted by recovery in world demand. In total, exports were close to the US$ 63 billion-mark. In general, the extraordinary external conditions will become a significant positive driver for growth in 2022. Analysts’ consensus forecasts a growth of exports between 11 to 12%.</p>

<p>Peruvian imports are mainly composed of final and intermediate goods, with machinery and raw materials for industrial use accounting for roughly half of the total value of imports. In 2019 imports of raw materials, capital and consumption goods stood at US$ 19.1 billion, US$ 12.3 billion and US$ 9.6 billion, respectively, for a total of US$ 41.1 billion. The recovery of internal demand boosted that number to more than US$ 48 billion in 2021.</p>

<p>In the fourth quarter of 2021, Peru’s exports to the UK amounted to US$ 389 million. On the other hand, UK’s exports to Peru stood at US$ 47 million. Avocados, mangoes, tangerines, asparagus and tin represent the main current Peruvian exports to the UK. Vehicles, whisky, fuel, chemicals and gas turbine parts are the main current UK exports to Peru. The current trade agreement between both countries eliminates the tariffs for 8 of the top 10 UK products entering Peru.</p>

<h4>Climate / Sustainability</h4>

<p>Peru is in the top 10 of the most biodiverse countries in the world and it hosts over 70% of the world’s total biodiversity, including over 2,000 species of fish, 1,736 species of birds, 500 species of mammals and 300 species of reptiles, and 10% of the worldwide species of flora.</p>

<p>However, activities such as illegal logging and mining have had their impact on the preservation of natural areas. The deforestation rate increased 37% in 2020, amounting to 2’636,585 hectares of tree cover loss between 2001 and 2020, resulting in 53% of total green-house gas emissions.</p>

<p>Climate change has also affected Peruvian ecosystems as forest fires have increased from 338 in 2000 to 7,922 in 2020, while 51% of glaciers have been lost so far. On the other hand, man-made climate impact is concentrated in the capital city, Lima, accounting for 58% of emissions from vehicles.</p>

<p>Peru has solid environmental legislation, including the National Environment Policy to 2030, to combat these adverse effects. As such, local authorities must propose alternatives to solve issues such as the loss of biological diversity – due to deforestation, illegal and informal activities – deterioration of environmental quality, increased risks and impacts from natural and anthropic hazards in a context of climate change.</p>

<p>The government has shown the intention to prioritize climate action, although detail of the policy is pending. Some key announcements include the need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and the establishment of a special tax regime for the aquaculture and forestry sector.</p>

<p>There are also many opportunities to bundle infrastructure and climate action as the government, with UK’s support, is planning to incorporate sustainability indicators to its National Infrastructure Plan and prioritize a social infrastructure agenda (plan). Moreover, after the issuance of its first tranche of sustainable bonds for US$ 4 billion, there could be more space for mobilising private investment to low-carbon infrastructure, like mature PPP projects from the National Infrastructure Plan, sustainable projects linked to the Agrarian Reform, or even green investment linked to the forestry sector.</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>Peru has a strong legal structure to protect foreign investors´ interests. The Constitution and associated legal framework guarantee private property rights, the fulfilment of contracts, free capital transfer and remittance of earnings, unrestricted access to internal and external credit and unrestricted access to most economic sectors with only a few exceptions, related to national security, for both national and foreign companies. In practice, implementation of this legal framework and red tape remain a challenge. Peru ranks 76th out of 190 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business.</p>

<p>Joining the OECD is a priority for Peru. In late January 2022, the OECD invited Peru, together with other five countries – including regional counterparts Argentina and Brazil – to start the accession process. Peru’s response was enthusiastic with President Castillo referring to Peru’s existing collaboration with the OECD and commitment to its values and standards based on the successful implementation of the ambitious Country Programme (2014-16). He added that their commitments “were reached with celerity” and continued to be fulfilled and strengthened through new legal instruments and participation in OECD technical committees.</p>

<p>The UK and Peru are in discussions for a tax treaty to avoid double taxation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Human Rights</h2>

<p>Peru is an active and consistent supporter of the rules-based international system and proponent of human rights. Their Constitution states that all people have the right to equality before the law and that no one may be discriminated against by reason of national origin, race, sex, language, religion, opinion, socio-economic or other status. But the country faces a number of domestic human rights challenges. A National Action Plan had galvanised positive movement, but the Covid-19 pandemic and political turmoil in recent year have exacerbated institutional challenges in the protection and defence of human rights.</p>

<p>Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) remains one of the most systemic and widespread human rights violations. Lima is considered the 5th most dangerous city for women in the world and the most dangerous city for women in Latin America. 68% of Peruvian women have been victims of gender-based violence, and over 215 cases of attempted femicide were registered between January and August 2021.   There were 2057 reported victims of human trafficking between 2019 and 2020. 44.4% of Peruvian women currently live in poverty, and only 43.7% have any work, mainly in informal jobs without proper access to social benefits. The Ministry of Women has developed a new National Policy on Gender Equality and a Strategic Plan of Action for Gender Equality.</p>

<p>Although there is growing acceptance for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual people, people of the LGBT+ community are particularly vulnerable to hate crime and discrimination. Peru’s national human rights strategy includes a reference to LGBT+ rights, but the appointment of a new Minister for Women and Vulnerable Populations who has publically opposed issues relating to gender equality is causing concern among civil- society and human rights organisations. Meanwhile there is renewed pressure from Congress to remove gender mainstreaming from education policy.</p>

<p>Peru has ratified all eight of the International Labour Organisation’s fundamental conventions. The law forbids businesses from hiring temporary workers to perform core company functions, requires businesses to monitor their contractors, and imposes liability on businesses for the actions of their contractors. There is however a high degree of informality in the Peruvian workforce (around 78.1%). Many businesses hire temporary or contract workers who are effectively barred from participating in those firms’ unions. The law prohibits forced or compulsory labour, including labour by children; however, such practices occur, primarily in the logging and mining industry.</p>

<p>Children are protected from sexual exploitation by Peruvian law; however cases of children trafficking for sexual exploitation purposes have been increasing especially in the Peruvian Amazon. Between 2019 and 2020, 73% of trafficking cases were for the purpose of sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>In 2011, Congress passed the Indigenous Consultation Law, which made it mandatory to seek indigenous people’s consent before starting development projects on their lands. Peru has also supported international standards, including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Inter-American Court standard, that require the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous People for any activity which could have a significant impact on their territories and resources. Nevertheless, the Ombudsman’s Office reported 196 social conflicts in August 2021 - only one case less than the total of 197 for December 2020. Such protests were previously regional and focused on socio-environmental interests like mining. 2020 saw larger, wide-ranging protests, including protest against Congress’ removal of former President Vizcarra in November and protests against a special labour regime for the agricultural sector in December 2020. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights recommended a thorough investigation into excessive use of force by the National Police (PNP) during the November- protests, in which dozens were injured and two young men died. A police officer was found guilty of firing the gun that killed a man during the agricultural protests.</p>

<p>October 2021 saw a spark in protests against mining operations across the country, and there are currently almost 200 active social conflicts in Peru. Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) have advocated for the respect and protection of human rights in the framework of protests. They have, however, also been exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Ministry of Justice, at least seven HRDs were killed between 2000 and May 2021, and dozens live under constant threat. Despite claims for protection and support, government action remains ineffective, as initiatives tend to be diluted in the bureaucratic legal system. In April 2021, the Peruvian government approved a multisector mechanism for the protection of Human Rights Defenders.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span> Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world. In addition, a commercial organisation carrying out business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Transparency International lists Peru as the 8th most corrupt country in South America and 109th place worldwide in the Corruption Perception Index for 2021 (published January 2022). With a score of 38, Peru falls by two points, but remains relatively stagnant on the index since 2012. The Peruvian Comptroller General’s Office estimates that around 15% of the 2019 public budget was lost through corruption and public sector misconduct (CGR, 2020).</p>

<p>Recent years have been marked by major corruption scandals in Peru linked to the Brazilian construction giant, Odebrecht. All former Peruvian Presidents, since 2001 are or have been under investigation for corruption or money laundering, in almost all cases related to the Odebrecht case.  Alejandro Toledo’s (2001-2006) extradition to Peru from the United States remains pending following his arrest in the U.S in July 2019. Alan Garcia (2006-2011) committed suicide in 2019 as police arrived to arrest him.  Ollanta Humala (2011-2016) and his wife Nadine Heredia were held in pre-trial detention from June 2017 to April 2018. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (2016-2018) has been in house arrest since his resignation from the presidency in March 2018.  Presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori is also under investigation for allegedly receiving campaign contributions from Odebrecht.  In November 2021 Martin Vizcarra, who assumed the presidency in 2018 and pursued a strong anti-corruption campaign, was removed from office by parliament following as yet unproven accusations of corruption committed as Regional Governor in 2014-16. This move, which was contested by the public, resulted in political instability in the midst of the pandemic and just months before the country’s general elections. The new government party Perú Libre’s leader, Vladimir Cerrón, was prohibited to run as Second Vice-President due to a corruption sentence.</p>

<p>Widespread corruption interferes with the efficient management of case backlogs in the Peruvian Judiciary. Lower-level corruption is also widespread, and anecdotal cases include cases of corruption in the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment by the Peruvian National Police during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Regional Government Framework (2003) was established with the intention of empowering regions through financial autonomy in order to prioritise and accelerate investment; however, statistics suggest they are one of the most corrupt institutions. Several former Regional Governors are in prison or under investigation for corruption.</p>

<p>Although recent corruption scandals have put corruption on top of the list of most problematic factors of doing business in Peru, other factors such as its strong legal framework counterbalance this, although legal processes can be slow and bureaucratic.</p>

<p>Since the end of President Alberto Fujimori’s regime in 2000, Peru has undergone reforms and has shown important progress in enhancing its accountability procedures and in developing capacities at various levels including through the use of online tools that facilitate business processes and reduce scope for petty corruption. In December 2016, the Presidential Commission of Integrity made 100 recommendations to act against corruption. Within the framework of the OECD Country Programme, several pieces of legislation have been passed, including bans on public office for those convicted of corruption; measures to strengthen the prevention, detection and sanction of money laundering and terrorism; extension of the administrative responsibility of legal entities and legislation to improve transparency, accountability and integrity in campaign financing. Peru also went from “participant” to “associate” in the Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions.</p>

<p>Investigations of corruption cases and the recent approval of crucial anti-corruption laws offer some improvements.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span> Protective security advice</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.cpni.gov.uk/" rel="external">Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure</a> also provides protective security advice to businesses.</p>

<p>Street crime, mainly opportunistic, is a problem in parts of Lima and other major cities. Express kidnappings (where the victim is taken to an ATM and forced to withdraw cash) are also a feature. Visitors should take particular care to use only authorised taxis from Lima airport (i.e. those booked at desks within the terminal building). Robberies at gun or knifepoint are not uncommon, but violence is not commonly used unless resistance is offered. Fuller details are given in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/peru/">FCDO Travel Advice for Peru</a>.</p>

<p>The incidence of kidnaps for ransom is low compared to many other Latin American countries. There is no evidence to suggest that foreigners are more at risk than Peruvians. Telephone tapping and other electronic surveillance of commercial and political targets is known to take place. There are a number of private companies offering a full range of security services to businesses and their personnel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Intellectual property – Peru</h2>

<p>Regulation of intellectual property rights in Peru is subject to international treaties such the Paris Convention (industrial property), the Berne Convention (copyrights) and Decision 486 of the Andean Community (industrial property). These treaties are complemented by local regulation covering industrial property and copyright matters. The national office for intellectual property and registrations is known as INDECOPI. Intellectual property rights are also subject to protection under Peruvian criminal law. The same legal principles for the regulation of industrial property in Peru apply to all countries in the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru). All industrial property rights require prior registration to be valid in Peru and they do not grant international protection, with the exception of other countries within the Andean Community.</p>

<p>As a consequence, it is advisable to have a valid registration of intellectual property rights in Peru. Procedures related to trademarks and other distinctive signs including registrations, infringement and oppositions have an estimated duration of six months (or even more, depending on the complexity of the case). In the case of patents, these terms can extend to two years and more. A backlog of unexamined patent applications is allowed in Peru within one year counted from the filing date abroad. Copyright and related rights regulation in Peru is based on the main principles of the Berne Convention.</p>

<p>Authors and copyright owners may start infringement actions before national authorities without prior registration. Peru has a significant market of piracy and counterfeit products that affect trademark and copyright owners. Even when Peru has local regulation for border measures and intellectual property protection against piracy, authorities such as the police and prosecutors need to strengthen compliance and national enforcement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Organised crime</h2>

<p>The major types of crime taking place in Peru are committed by organised criminal groups dealing in illegal mining and other environmental crimes, drugs, trafficking of arms and persons, money laundering, extortion and street crime.  Homicide is below the levels found in other Latin American countries.</p>

<p>According to the Peruvian FIU, illegal mining now generates greater profits than cocaine trafficking. Illegal mining accounted for $880 million of illicit proceeds from January to September 2019, and 45% of all money laundered in Peru in past 9 years. 1.75 billion in illicit funds flowed through Peru in the same period. This accounts for the criminality that is known about; environmental crime is widely believed to be under-reported. Peru’s justice system is only just beginning to tackle this environmental criminality.  Illegal logging is also increasing, now accounting for $155 million a year. Peru laundered 2.2 billion between 98 and 2017 in-country, directly through Peruvian banks.</p>

<p>Peru is a major producer and exporter of cocaine. Conservative estimates indicate that the country produces over 400 metric tonnes of cocaine annually, over 80% of which is destined for Europe. Both Mexican and Colombian cartels are involved in the drugs trade in Peru, and remnants of the Shining Path terrorist movement are said to be providing protection for coca growers and the drug traffickers’ supply lines. Corruption within transport infrastructure such as major container terminals and airports supports the facilitation of cocaine trafficking.  Covid 19 initially disrupted cocaine trafficking, leading to stockpiling due to the closure of borders and travel restrictions.  However, large seizures of cocaine in European ports suggest the trafficking of large shipments of cocaine is ongoing, and OCG strategies have adapted.  UNODC reported a 46% drop in coca leaf prices in Peru from January to April 2020, but recent reports show it has recovered its value from May 2020.</p>

<p>Significant violence associated with organised crime has mainly been confined to the remote coca growing and drug producing areas in the central-Andean Huallaga, Ene and Apurimac river valleys. Confrontations between the authorities and Shining Path remnants in these areas have led to a number of deaths on both sides. Drug related violence is not a widespread problem in Lima or other cities, but there is significant use of violence in and around the ports by organised criminal groups to defend territory. In November 2021, the government authorised the deployment of the Armed Forces to support Police efforts against violent crime in Lima for a period of 30 days. This has been widely criticised for the potential human rights implications, including by former members of the military and the UN.</p>

<p>Though there has been a recent increase in execution style killings in the capital they are not frequent, and bystanders have in general not been affected. The Peruvian government is committed to tackling the drug problem and associated financial crime, but faces an uphill struggle.</p>
