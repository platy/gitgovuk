<h2>July 2022</h2>

<p>Paragraphs 4 to 7: Renamed section and updated to focus on inspectors’ powers to gather, use and store evidence.</p>

<p>Paragraph 8: New paragraph to explain that Ofsted may carry out research as part of our inspection activities.</p>

<p>Paragraph 12: New paragraph to explain the different modes of delivering further education courses.</p>

<p>Removed the ‘Inspection and the COVID-19 pandemic’ section and incorporated this into paragraph 63.</p>

<p>Paragraph 143: Added information on how a provider can use the Ofsted logo if judged good or outstanding.</p>

<p>Annex: Removed transitional arrangements (previously in the glossary and under the ‘Good’ grade descriptors for the quality of education and training judgement).</p>

<h2>February 2022</h2>

<p>We have updated the note under the ‘Good’ grade descriptor for the quality of education and training judgement to reflect that we intend to review transition arrangements relating to COVID-19 in time for September 2022.</p>

<h2>December 2021</h2>

<h3>References to newly qualified teachers (NQTs)</h3>

<p>We have updated all references to newly qualified teachers (NQTs) to refer to early career teachers (ECTs), including the glossary, due to the recently published DfE guidance, ‘Induction for early career teachers (England)’.</p>

<h3>References to <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> ‘providers’ and ‘partnerships’</h3>

<p>Paragraphs 9 to 11: we have included a new explanatory statement to clarify the meaning of references made to ‘partnerships’ and ‘providers’ throughout the handbook. This is to reflect that not all teacher training provision inspected under the framework is a formal ‘partnership’.</p>

<h3>References to centre-based and placement-based teacher training</h3>

<p>Paragraphs 12 to 13: We have included new paragraphs to clarify the meaning of references to centre-based and placement-based teacher training and how these are used in the context of further education teacher training.</p>

<h3>Teacher Training provision in scope of <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspections</h3>

<p>Paragraph 14: We have included a new section to confirm the routes into teaching (for all age phases) that are in scope of an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspection.</p>

<h3>Reference to pupils</h3>

<p>Paragraph 17: We have included a note to define the term ‘pupils’ used throughout the document. This is to clarify that the term ‘pupils’ is used to refer to children in early years, pupils at primary and secondary, students in post-16 provision and learners in FES, as appropriate to the teacher education phase.</p>

<h3>How we determine the timing of an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspection</h3>

<p>Paragraph 20: We have included confirmation of the change to the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspection cycle following the conclusion of Department for Education’s Initial teacher training (ITT) market review.</p>

<h3>Concurrent inspection of validated programmes</h3>

<p>Paragraphs 46 to 47: We have revised previous statements, to simplify and clarify arrangements for the inspection of validated programmes.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<p>First paragraph under ‘good’ criteria for quality of education and training: We have updated the transitional statement, confirming that we will review the arrangements in March 2022. This approach aligns with other remits under the education inspection framework (<abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Annex A – Instructions and guidance for thematic subject inspections</h3>

<p>We have removed all references to ‘focused’ in Annex A to avoid confusion with refences to ‘focused reviews’. We confirm that thematic subject inspections are not part of a full routine inspection.</p>

<h2>April 2021</h2>

<p>This section outlines changes to inspection practice. This does not include corrections or changes made to improve clarity in how the framework is written.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Page 6, paragraph 14 – a new footnote reference has been included, to redirect readers to the published risk assessment methodology for <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Page 10, paragraphs 40-45 – a new section on ‘Inspection during the COVID-19 pandemic’ has been included. This section provides clarity around inspection practice in the COVID-19 context, such as expectations around on-site inspections and the inspection preparation discussions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Page 19, paragraphs 77 and 80 – new references to the point-of-inspection trainee and staff surveys that are introduced under the new framework.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>December 2020</h2>

<p>Following a review of the consultation responses we received during January to April 2020, we have reviewed the draft framework and handbook document in full.</p>

<p>Most of the amendments made have been to tidy up formatting and the language used and to remove any repetition that might cause confusion.</p>

<p>However, we have made the following amendments that are important to draw your attention to.</p>

<h3>Concurrent inspection of validated programmes</h3>

<p>See page 10, paragraphs 42 and 43.</p>

<p>We received feedback that our original statement, setting out arrangements for validated programmes was not very clear (previously set out as paragraph 83). We have now revised this section to expand on our explanation about validated programmes and the fact that we will carry out the inspection of these programmes concurrently.</p>

<h3>Information that partnerships must provide</h3>

<p>See pages 10–18.</p>

<p>We received feedback that the list of information expected from partnerships was confusing in terms of whether we require information for planning purposes or for the first day of inspection. We have reviewed this section in full to set out what we expect to receive and by when.</p>

<h3>References to formative and summative assessment</h3>

<p>See pages 9, 11, 16, 27, 36, 43, 44, 46, 48 and 51.</p>

<p>Respondents raised concerns about the expectations around trainee assessment within the draft handbook. To provide clarity, we have provided a response to this concern within our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/initial-teacher-education-inspection-framework-and-handbook-2020-inspecting-the-quality-of-teacher-education">consultation report</a> and have distinguished between formative and summative assessment. Specific references to ‘formative’ and ‘summative’ assessment are now included throughout the handbook</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<p>See page 38 (first paragraph under ‘good’).</p>

<p>We have added a transitional arrangement statement to the handbook. This addresses the fact that we are aware partnerships may have made significant progress in developing their curriculum plans but may not have fully completed this by the time we start inspecting. This approach aligns with that of education inspection framework (<abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Leadership and management</h3>

<p>See pages 46–50.</p>

<p>The leadership and management paragraphs that precede the grade descriptors have been restructured to make a clearer distinction between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>statements that indicate sources of evidence that inspectors will or must consider</li>
  <li>criteria that inspectors use in applying their judgement when considering the evidence</li>
</ul>
