<p>If you have been sexually assaulted it is important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention.</li>
  <li>report to local police.</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see Rape and Sexual
Assault: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Returning to the UK</a> .</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 1669, or Tourist Police on 1155, or Tourist Assistance Centre on 1672</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one.</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bangkok">British Embassy Bangkok</a> at +66(0)2 305 8333. Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you want to report the incident to the police in Thailand</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</li>
  <li>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy or consulate on +66(0)2 305 8333 and they can offer you consular support.</li>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are no risks from reporting to local police. Extramarital sex or homosexuality is not a crime in Thailand. Drinking or drug taking is a crime but it does not carry a harsher punishment if committed by certain person, e.g. a Muslim.</li>
  <li>You can also request a female or male police officer to speak with you, depending on their availability. If you wish, we may be able to accompany you to the police station.</li>
  <li>You will be asked to give a statement to the police as to what incident has happened to you and who the perpetrator(s) was.</li>
  <li>You will be asked to undergo a medical examination as part of the investigation.</li>
  <li>The police may also ask you to give your clothes as evidence of the attack to present to a forensic examiner. These will be returned when the investigation or trial is completed.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the police may take you back to the scene of the crime but this happens less in present and you have right to refuse to go.</li>
  <li>Once you completed the police report and statement there will generally be no restriction on leaving Thailand. However, you may be asked to return to Thailand to testify before the court after the case was filed with the court. The idea of having you testifying in the court is for the court to confirm your testimony given to the police and, in case the accused pleaded not guilty, to give the accused an opportunity to cross-examine which is an important
procedure in a criminal case as the accused would not have this opportunity during the police or public prosecutor stage. However, this may traumatise and cause you distress.</li>
  <li>You should consult with a lawyer the possibility of applying to testify from the UK if travelling to Thailand is a hurdle. Before departure from Thailand, you should consult with the lawyer, the police or the public prosecutor whether you should apply to the court to give a testimony to the court in advance. It will be much more convenient for you to testify to the court before leaving Thailand so not to return to Thailand again during trial.</li>
</ul>

<p>When being cross-examined, Section 226/4 of the Criminal Procedure Code which states that “in the case of sexual offence, the accused person shall not adduce evidence or make cross-examination with a question being concerned with the injured person’s sexual behaviour to other person out of the accused person unless it is permitted by Court according to an application” will apply. In practice, judges are mindful to control the proceedings not to allow inappropriate questions unless they see that they are material to the case. Your lawyer should assist you through the cross-examination process and protect you from exposing to inappropriate questions.</p>

<p>Unless your age is less than 18 years old, there is no procedure in place whereby you can ask for the presence of a psychiatrist, a social worker or a public prosecutor during a police interview. However, under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the female you has the right to request for a female inquiry officer and to ask that a trusted person be with her when giving the statement.</p>

<p>Instead of going to the police station first, the you may go to the nearest hospital if he/she needs medical treatment and contact the One Stop Service Center (OSCC) of the Police General Hospital on 1300 for help and inform the OSCC and the hospital that the you wishes to have a medical treatment and to make a criminal complaint for the incident that happened to him/her. The OSCC should assist you through the process while you receives medical treatment. The OSCC may also provide you an access to a psychiatrist and/or a social worker if needed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You do not have to surrender your passport whilst any investigation is carried out.</li>
  <li>A lawyer will not be automatically assigned to the victim. You have to contact and appoint your own lawyer. In such a case, you should instruct your lawyer to protect your right.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Thailand</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the British embassy will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK .</li>
  <li>they can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</li>
  <li>if you are travelling with one, you can also report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</li>
  <li>it is your choice on whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated.</li>
  <li>if you do not report the crime, you will still be able to get medical attention.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</li>
  <li>if you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-bangkok">British Embassy Bangkok</a> , or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</li>
  <li>if you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</li>
  <li>the UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</li>
  <li>you can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to you support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting the crime in Thailand - what happens next?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</li>
  <li>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you wish, we may be able to accompany you to the police station.</li>
  <li>You can also request a female or male police officer to speak with you, depending on their availability.</li>
  <li>A statement will be written in Thai and the police should provide an interpreter. This statement will generally include your account of what happened, including description of the person, location, any injuries and whether you were drugged or under the influence of alcohol.</li>
  <li>You should be given a copy of the police report.</li>
  <li>The police will keep your clothes or electronic equipment which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner.</li>
  <li>The police will send you to the local hospital for a forensic examination. These hospitals are easily accessible.</li>
  <li>The local police would unlikely inform UK police about the incident. Instead, they will inform the British Embassy if you are a British national.</li>
  <li>It is very unlikely that the local police will ask UK to undertake police checks on you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Medical Examination</h2>

<p>If you have been sexually assaulted you should consider getting medical help as soon as possible. In most provinces there are Government hospitals which have a One Stop Crisis Centre (OSCC) for medical treatment of survivors of sexual assault.</p>

<p>Generally, the hospital requires a referral letter from the police to carry out a medical examination. This is not needed for medical treatment. Some hospitals, including Police General Hospital in Bangkok, will accept survivors without a referral from the police and there is no requirement to report to the police before going to hospital.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, if you would like time to decide on whether you want the police involved, they will take forensic evidence and then wait for your decision.</p>

<p>The examination will be carried out by a doctor and can involve both a physical examination, photographs and the taking of samples for evidence.</p>

<p>Whenever possible our staff will accompany you to hospital to support you, if that is what you want.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>You may be at risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Emergency anti-HIV medication, called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may prevent HIV infection. Most government hospitals’ can advise you on PEP medication, however, English is not widely spoken in government hospitals.</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours to be effective. This is available over the counter at pharmacies in all provinces and Government hospitals.</p>

<p>You or your insurer will need to pay for all medical treatment, consultations etc.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you can let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police Investigation in Thailand – what to expect</h2>

<p>The British Embassy has worked with the police in Thailand in an attempt to introduce standard protocols. However, the way the police respond may vary.</p>

<p>Sometimes they may take you back to the scene of the crime or you will be put face to face with the person who assaulted you. This can be very distressing. Where possible the British Embassy will offer assistance to help you through this process.</p>

<p>It has been common practice in the past for the police to get both the survivor and perpetrator to agree a sum of compensation to be paid in order to avoid a criminal charge and court appearance. This practice is no longer allowed under Thai law.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the police report and your statement there will generally be no restriction on you leaving Thailand. You can request to be kept updated when you return to the UK. We would strongly recommend that you use a local English-speaking lawyer who will be able to keep you updated with how the case progresses. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers/list-of-english-speaking-family-lawyers-in-thailand">the Embassy’s list of lawyers</a></p>

<p>Once the police make an arrest, it depends whether the suspect will be taken before the public prosecutor. An arrest warrant has to be applied to and obtained from a court. Before issuing an arrest warrant, the police may take sometimes to investigate the case including to summon the accused to acknowledge the accusations. If the police finds a probable cause that the accused committed the alleged crime, the police will apply to a court for an arrest warrant.</p>

<p>You will not be expected to go in front of the public prosecutor to make a statement. Lawyers do not have access to your case notes at this stage until the case is filed with the court and evidence is submitted by the public prosecutor to the court.</p>

<p>You should contact the Lawyers Council of Thailand for a pro bono legal services. In addition, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wmp.or.th/" rel="external">Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation</a> offers a pro bono legal services for sexual abuse cases. English speaking officers are available.</p>

<p>For child yous, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/childlinethailand" rel="external">Childline foundation</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/cpcr.cpcr" rel="external">Center for Protection of Children’ rights</a> .</p>

<h2>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<p>If you wish to leave Thailand, it may be possible for you to give evidence in advance to a court, depending on the complexity of the case.</p>

<p>There is no fixed timescale for the court process. The length of time court proceedings can take depends on a wide range of factors including case complexity or if the assailant pleads guilty or not guilty.</p>

<p>The court will not automatically update the British Embassy on progress but we can make enquiries and seek updates from the court on your behalf.</p>

<p>If found guilty, the court may order the offender to pay you compensation. Additionally in principle, two compensation schemes operate in Thailand from the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Justice. You may wish to discuss this with a lawyer, or our Embassy staff can provide you with details on how to claim.</p>

<p>You are expected to testify in court after the public prosecutor made a decision to press charges and file the case with the court. This can be several months from the time that you first reported the incident and gave the statement of the case. You may apply to the Thai court to testify from the UK but this is subject to Thai court’s discretion and has not been regularly granted.</p>

<p>You are entitled to be kept aware of the case even without a lawyer being appointed. The benefits in hiring a lawyer are that the lawyer can act as your representative in Thailand to physically visit the authorities and to write to the authorities in Thai to follow up with the case on behalf of you. The other benefit may be that the lawyer could assist you in filing a claim for compensation against the perpetrator. In addition to pressing claim against the perpetrator, then you have the right to make an application to the Committee for the Consideration of Compensation to Victims and Defendants at the Office of Financial Assistance to Victims and Defendants in Criminal Matters at the Ministry of Justice within 1 year from the date of the incident. This application can be made by your lawyer on your behalf. You may also apply to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports for a compensation from the Remedies for Foreign Tourists Funds.</p>

<p>You may be asked to give an additional statement if the public prosecutor thinks the statement given to the police is unclear or insufficient. In addition, you are normally required to testify to a court which you may be cross-examined by the accused’s counsel.</p>

<p>The Penal Code was amended in 2019 which limits the possibility of the victim to drop charges. For example, under the present Penal Code, rape charges can only be dropped if the rape was committed to a spouse, that he/she was not seriously injured and that it was not done in a public place.</p>

<p>Unless you made a false accusation or statement in which you may be prosecuted for the said action.</p>

<p>Rape charges cannot be dropped unless the rape was done to a spouse that he/she was not seriously injured and that it was not done in a public place (see Section 281 of the Penal Code).</p>

<p>The alleged assailant can press counter charges claiming false accusations. This is pursuant to the Penal Code Section 172 which states that “whoever, giving any false information concerning a criminal offence, which may likely cause injury to the other person or the public, to the Public Prosecutor, official conducting cases, inquiry official or any official who has the power to investigate the criminal cases, shall be punished with imprisonment not exceeding two years or fined not exceeding four thousand Baht, or both.”</p>

<p>Courts can order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, either after they have been convicted in a criminal court or as a result of civil action.</p>

<h2>Additional Legal information</h2>

<p>How can my case be taken to trial?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do victims need to file anything particular? If so, what? And what does this mean? Who does this need to be filed by?</li>
</ul>

<p>Victims need to file a criminal complaint with the police. A criminal complaint can be filed verbally with the police who will record it in writing and will then ask the victim to sign it. A criminal complaint is basically a document which explains what and when incident happened to him/herself, the identity of the perpetrator and a request to the police to investigate the case and take legal action against the perpetrator.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How long do victims have to make the relevant filing? Can this be done from the UK? Do they need a local legal representative to do this? Must it be done in the local language?</li>
</ul>

<p>Victims have to make the filing of a criminal complaint on rape within the applicable prescription period under Thai law. If the rape was done by his/her spouse or if it is the case of an indecent assault in a private place and victim is more than 15 years old of age, the complaint has to be filed within 3 months from the incident (Section 281 of the Penal Code). For other situation, the prescription period is longer, generally 10 years (Section 276 and 95(3) of the Penal Code). However, victims are advisable to file a criminal complaint as soon as the incident took place so that all fresh evidence could be gathered and examined by the concerning authorities in due course.</p>

<p>A criminal complaint has to be done in Thailand and cannot be done from the UK. The victims do not need a local legal representative to file a criminal complaint. It has to be done in Thai but the police station should be able to provide a translator for the victims.</p>

<h3>Trial procedures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When will victims know whether there is going to be a trial? In what language will the trail be conducted?</li>
</ul>

<p>The victims will need to follow up with the public prosecutor in charge of the case as to the status of the case and whether there is going to be a trial. If a trial is fixed and the victims are called to testify, they will be summoned by the court to appear during a trial, on the request of the public prosecutor. Trial will be conducted in Thai.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do victims need to be present at every court session? If not, which ones (if any)? Will the victim be able to testify from the UK or will they be expected to return to the country?</li>
</ul>

<p>The victims do not need to be present at every court session. They are likely to be required to present at trial to testify before the court. Under the present law, the victim may apply to testify from the UK to the Thai court. If the court does not permit this, the victim may be expected to return to the country to testify.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the victim does have to attend a trial abroad, will the authorities in the country concerned assist with travel and accommodation arrangements? Will they provide any other support?</li>
</ul>

<p>The authorities concerned may assist the victims with travel and accommodation arrangements but generally they do not cover all the costs that have to be incurred. The costs that can be reimbursed under the present concerning court’s regulation is just between THB 300 to THB 1,000 per day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How long does it take for a case to come to trial? How long do RSA trials usually last? Does it then take longer for a final sentence to be passed? Does the defendant then have the right to appeal? How many appeal hearings can there be?</li>
</ul>

<p>This depends. If the accused pleads guilty, the case will move to court relatively quickly. In such case, a trial will not be held if the charge contains less than 5 years imprisonment term.</p>

<p>In the event that the accused pleads not guilty. The process can take a few months up to a year or so until the case reaches the court. The trial itself could also be lengthy. For example, during trial the accused would provide some number of alibi witnesses while the public prosecutor would call for all prosecutor witnesses whom the defendant states his/her intention to cross-examine them. These witnesses are, for example, forensic doctors who performed the forensic examination on the victim, the police in charge, the victims and other factual witnesses.</p>

<p>Therefore, a RSA trial may last from a few month times up to a year or even two, depending on how the accused pleads, the complexity of the case and the number of witnesses to be presented by both parties and etc.</p>

<p>The defendant has the right to appeal within 1 month from the date of the Court of First Instance’s decision and has right to appeal within 1 month from the date of the Court of Appeals’s decision, subject to certain appeal restrictions under the law. It can take approximately 1-2 years in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. There is no appeal hearing in the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3>Hiring a lawyer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What role can a privately-hired lawyer perform?</li>
</ul>

<p>A privately-hired lawyer can help guiding the victim through the criminal process.

In addition, the lawyer can make a request, on behalf of the victim, to be the joint plaintiff with the public prosecutor in the criminal case against the perpetrator which would allow the victim to present his/her own evidence in support of the case and to file a separate appeal against the decision of the Court of First Instance/the Court of Appeals in the event that the decision is not favourable to him/her (for example, if the victim feels the sentence imposed by the court was too lenient). In addition, the lawyer can assist the victim with submissions of documents and motions to the authorities and courts such as a motion to testify via video conference. The lawyer can also assist the victim to claim compensations against the perpetrator and to request for the available legal remedies from the relevant Thai authorities.</p>
