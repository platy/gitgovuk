<span class="number">1. </span> Operator legal entity</h2>

<h3>Question 1: Is the legal entity correct?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Legal entities include limited companies, charities, voluntary groups, partnerships, public authorities, or sole traders.</p>

<p>The operator must hold the licence under the correct legal entity and must notify the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain of any changes to the legal entity within 28 days.</p>

<p>An operator that has changed their legal entity will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://movingon.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/20/changing-your-business-status/" rel="external">apply for a new operator licence.</a></p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The examiner will check that legal entity details and directors listed on Vehicle Operator Licensing system (<abbr title="vehicle operator licensing system">VOL</abbr>) match the records on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house">Companies House</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of sole trader or partnership entities, the examiner should make enquiries with the operator to confirm that the legal entity is correct and up to date.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>Satisfactory <br> (all of the requirements)</td>
      <td>The legal entity registered at Companies House is as stated on <abbr title="vehicle operator licensing system">VOL</abbr>. <br><br> There is no mismatch of company directors or partners. <br><br>  The sole trader or partnership is as stated on <abbr title="vehicle operator licensing system">VOL</abbr>.</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Report to traffic commissioners</td>
      <td>The legal entity is not correct.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Further information</h4>

<p>The examiner will contact the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain if the legal entity is incorrect. The traffic commissioner will confirm if the operation can continue. The examiner must tell the operator they are operating illegally.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the examiner will continue the investigation and report all the facts to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Condition of vehicles examined at the fleet check</h2>

<h3>Question 2a: State the number of vehicles and trailers in possession for the scope of the investigation</h3>

<p>This is the number of vehicles and trailers at operating centres that are in scope of this investigation.</p>

<h3>Question 2b: Were any vehicles or trailers inspected?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Where possible, carry out an unannounced inspection of the operator’s vehicles and trailers. On the maintenance investigation report form, the word “vehicle” refers to vehicles and trailers.</p>

<p>The purpose of the fleet check is to work out if the operator’s maintenance system is effective in making sure vehicles are used in a roadworthy condition.</p>

<p>The examiner must inspect enough vehicles need to establish the general condition of the fleet.</p>

<p>The scope of the investigation could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be limited to a fleet operating from one centre</li>
  <li>involve several fleets from multiple centres under the same operator licence</li>
  <li>involve fleets listed on multiple operator licences</li>
</ul>

<p>Vehicle inspections should be as detailed as possible, based on the available inspection facilities.</p>

<p>The examiner can include operator-owned trailers and third-party trailers where the operator is responsible for the trailer at the time of the visit in the fleet check.</p>

<p>Where possible the inspection should cover vehicles and trailers of a range of different types, of various ages, and at different stages in their inspection and annual test cycle.</p>

<p>The minimum number of vehicles the examiner should inspect as part of an investigation:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Fleet size (in possession)</td>
      <td>Minimum number to inspect</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 – 5</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6 – 50</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>51 – 100</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&gt;100</td>
      <td>5%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is a recommended minimum. The examiner may need to change the number of vehicles they inspect depending on the circumstances.</p>

<div class="example">
<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>An operating centre with 3 vehicles and 6 trailers will be considered to have a fleet of 9.</p>
</div>

<p>The vehicle examiner must be satisfied that the threat to road safety has been mitigated by the extent of the fleet check carried out If serious defects are found during the fleet inspection.</p>

<h4>Unavailable vehicles</h4>

<p>The examiner should  make a short-notice appointment if vehicles are unavailable for an unannounced inspection. They should use full inspection facilities where possible.</p>

<h4>Out of use vehicles</h4>

<p>Examiners will not usually inspect or prohibit vehicles under repair or vehicles that are partially dismantled awaiting spare parts.</p>

<p>When an operator is carrying out limited repair work and the vehicle looks like it was last used on a road in a dangerous condition, the examiner may carry out an inspection and take prohibition action for dangerous defects that existed before the repair.</p>

<p>The examiner will note that the vehicle was off the road and stated to be under repair on the prohibition and include this note in their investigation report.</p>

<p>This also applies to any vehicle which the operator claims has been withdrawn from use pending disposal.</p>

<h4>Out of scope vehicle types</h4>

<p>The examiner may inspect vehicles that do not come under operator licensing if there is cause for concern and report the results to the traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>Vehicles which are out of the scope of operator licensing (for example light goods, agricultural or small passenger carrying vehicles) but are controlled by the operator, may also be inspected where there is cause for concern, and the results reported to the traffic commissioner.</p>

<p>The examiner should record all notices (clear and prohibition) against the operator licence number, even though these vehicles are not on the operator licence</p>

<p>The examiner should note any prohibition they issue to a vehicle in the ‘out of use’ or ‘out of scope’ in Question 10a.</p>

<p>The operator compliance risk score does not consider vehicles that are out of scope.</p>

<h3>Question 2c: Were prohibitions issued at the fleet check?</h3>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The fleet check table must show all vehicles and trailers inspected at the fleet check.</p>

<p>The examiner must record the vehicle inspection against the most serious action level on the table, making it clear whether the prohibition was S marked.</p>

<p>The examiner will assess prohibitions issued at the fleet check at Question 10.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span> Operating centre</h2>

<h3>Question 3a: Is the authorised operating centre being used?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The operating centre is where the operator normally keeps authorised vehicles when not in use. When applying for an operator’s licence, the applicant gives the address of the proposed centres and information about the numbers of trailers and vehicles they’ll keep there.</p>

<p>The operator needs to show that the operating centre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is large enough for the authorised fleet of vehicles and trailers</li>
  <li>has safe access</li>
  <li>is in an environmentally acceptable location</li>
</ul>

<p>The examiner will check the current operating centres against authorised operating centres recorded on the vehicle operator licensing system (<abbr title="vehicle operator licensing system">VOL</abbr>), including a check of licence undertakings and conditions which may be relevant to the individual sites.</p>

<p>Any breach of undertakings or conditions is assessed in Question 12.</p>

<h3>Question 3b: Are the parking arrangements adequate?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/being-a-goods-vehicle-operator/operating-centres">operating centre</a> is where the operator normally keeps authorised vehicles when not in use. When applying for an operator’s licence, the applicant gives the address of the proposed centres and information about the numbers of trailers and vehicles they’ll keep there.</p>

<p>The operator needs to show that the operating centre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is large enough for the authorised fleet of vehicles and trailers</li>
  <li>has safe access and egress for the types of vehicles and trailers operated from that centre</li>
</ul>

<p>The examiner must check current operating centres against authorised operating centres recorded on the vehicle operator licensing system (<abbr title="vehicle operator licensing system">VOL</abbr>) and the vehicles authorised to be parked at that centre.</p>

<p>For third-party operating centres shared by several operators, the examiner should check that the operator has adequate parking arrangements in place with the owner of the premises or land.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Inspection and maintenance records</h2>

<h3>Record sampling</h3>

<p>Record sampling must be representative of the fleet of vehicles included within the scope of the maintenance investigation, which may involve checking records from various operating centres.</p>

<p>The examiner can carry out record sampling that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is limited to a fleet operating from one centre</li>
  <li>involves several fleets from multiple centres under the same operator licence</li>
  <li>involves fleets listed on multiple operator licences</li>
</ul>

<p>The sample should also include records covering different types of maintenance provider the operator uses, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufacturers’ approved workshops</li>
  <li>independent maintenance providers</li>
  <li>mobile maintenance</li>
  <li>in-house workshops</li>
</ul>

<p>The sample should also include records that cover a range of vehicle or trailer types, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>articulated or rigid vehicles</li>
  <li>buses or coaches</li>
  <li>semi or drawbar trailers</li>
</ul>

<h3>No prohibitions issued in the last 15 months</h3>

<p>The examiner will carry out detailed record analysis for the last 12 months using the safety inspection period calculator and analysis tool (<abbr title="safety inspection period calculator and analysis tool">SIPCAT</abbr>), which will help to identify trends, strengths or weaknesses within the operator’s maintenance system.</p>

<p>The examiner must check a minimum number of vehicle files based on the number of vehicles in scope of the fleet inspection. A ‘file’ is all relevant maintenance documents for a vehicle or trailer.</p>

<p>The examiner will increase the sample size if there are significant problems so that they can establish if there is a systemic issue or if these are just isolated problems.</p>

<h3>Prohibitions issued within the last 15 months</h3>

<p>Where possible, the examiner will check all files for encounters that have resulted in a prohibition notice. The encounters the examiner will check are for the most recent out of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period since the last public inquiry where roadworthiness prohibitions were considered</li>
  <li>the period since the last maintenance investigation fleet check</li>
  <li>the last 15 months of encounters and tests</li>
</ul>

<p>The examiner will check files since the issue date of the operator licence if this is less than 15 months ago.</p>

<p>The examiner will carry out detailed record analysis for the last 15 months using the safety inspection period calculator and analysis tool (<abbr title="safety inspection period calculator and analysis tool">SIPCAT</abbr>) to help work out the root cause of any prohibition defects.</p>

<p>Examiners must check a minimum number of vehicle files based on the number of vehicles in scope of the investigation and the number of prohibitions issued to the operator in the last 15 months. A ‘file’ is all relevant maintenance documents for a vehicle or trailer.</p>

<p>Where the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) has issued any prohibitions to the operator in the last 15 months, the examiner should check all prohibition (PG9) files where possible. They should check a random sample of files as well if the number of prohibition files is less than the minimum file sample for the fleet size.</p>

<h3>Question 4a: Are maintenance records suitable and available?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The examiner will assess inspection and maintenance records against the recommendations in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-maintaining-roadworthiness">guide to maintaining roadworthiness</a>.</p>

<p>The safety inspection record must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of owner or operator</li>
  <li>date of inspection</li>
  <li>vehicle identity (registration mark or trailer number)</li>
  <li>make and model</li>
  <li>odometer (mileage recorder) reading for vehicles not fitted with a hub meter</li>
  <li>a list of all the manual items to be inspected</li>
  <li>an indication of the condition of each item inspected</li>
  <li>details of any defects</li>
  <li>name of inspector</li>
  <li>full details of any repair work and who did it</li>
  <li>a signed declaration that any defects have been repaired satisfactorily and the vehicle is now in a safe roadworthy condition</li>
</ul>

<p>All details should be legible.</p>

<p>Additional requirements for electronic systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hard copies of records should be available so that they can be produced on request</li>
  <li>the system must be tamper-proof (for example, records can’t be changed at a later date)</li>
  <li>it must be clear what’s been checked and by whom</li>
  <li>there must be a clear end-to-end audit trail</li>
  <li>data files should cover all maintenance records for the fleet</li>
  <li>the system should meet data protection requirements (including the general data protection regulation)</li>
  <li>there should be a data back-up and disaster recovery system</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 4b: Are records completed?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Completion of inspection and maintenance records should be assessed against the recommendations in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-maintaining-roadworthiness">guide to maintaining roadworthiness</a>.</p>

<p>Safety inspections must include items covered by the MOT test (also known as ‘annual test’).</p>

<p>Any work carried out as a result of safety inspections must be recorded.</p>

<p>Operators must keep a complete set of safety inspection records for at least 15 months for all vehicles, including vehicles that have been removed from an operator licence.</p>

<p>The operator must have fully completed safety inspection reports for each safety inspection for both vehicles and trailers. The operator does not need to keep a paper version if they store the safety inspection report electronically.</p>

<p>Important features of a computerised system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hard copies of records should be available so that they can be produced on request</li>
  <li>the system must be tamper-proof (for example, records cannot be changed at a later date)</li>
  <li>it must be clear what is been checked and by whom</li>
  <li>there must be a complete audit trail</li>
  <li>data files should cover all maintenance records for the fleet</li>
  <li>the system should meet data protection requirements (including the general data protection regulation)</li>
  <li>there should be a data back-up and disaster recovery system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully electronic inspection records</li>
  <li>a forward planning system</li>
  <li>drivers’ walkaround checks and defect reporting</li>
  <li>a performance dashboard</li>
</ul>

<h4>Braking performance</h4>

<p>Every safety inspection must assess the braking performance of the vehicle or trailer. There are 4 ways to check brake performance at a safety inspection:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Roller brake test (laden where possible)</li>
  <li>Decelerometer (rigid vehicles)</li>
  <li>Electronic braking performance monitoring system for trailers</li>
  <li>Road test with brake temperature measurement</li>
</ol>

<p>A road test to check brake performance for all planned safety inspections is not enough to provide a satisfactory assessment throughout the year.</p>

<p>Operators should complete at least three successful brake efficiency tests for each vehicle or trailer spread throughout the year as well as the MOT test.</p>

<p>The safety inspector must record how they tested braking performance on safety inspection reports.</p>

<h3>Question 4c: Are inspection intervals satisfactory?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Operators must make sure that safety inspections are carried out at the intervals specified on their operator licence and that the inspection intervals meet the operational needs of the vehicles being used.</p>

<p>When deciding how often to inspect a vehicle, operators should consider the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>condition of the vehicle</li>
  <li>age and type of vehicle</li>
  <li>recommendations of the vehicle manufacturer</li>
  <li>nature of the vehicle’s load, the equipment and fittings it carries or supports</li>
  <li>type and range of operations on which the vehicle is likely to be engaged</li>
  <li>type of terrain and the nature of the environment in which the vehicle operates or is likely to operate</li>
  <li>distance and speeds at which the vehicle travels and the journey times</li>
</ul>

<p>Operators need to monitor the results of safety inspections to make sure their safety inspection intervals are effective and that vehicles are used in a roadworthy condition.</p>

<p>First-use inspections are essential for operators who lease, hire or borrow vehicles. These are especially important where vehicles and trailers have been off the road for some time.</p>

<p>Operators must keep a complete set of safety inspection records for at least 15 months for all vehicles, including vehicles that have been removed from an operator licence.</p>

<h3>Question 4d: Effective forward planning system in use?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The operator must plan the dates when safety inspections are due. They can use a manual or digital system.</p>

<p>Manual systems can use a simple planner or wall chart to identify inspections, annual tests and calibration dates at least six months in advance.</p>

<p>Digital systems should also contain this information and can also automatically schedule from the last inspection.</p>

<h3>Question 4e: Is there a robust vehicle off the road (<abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr>) system in place?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>When a vehicle is declared off the road (<abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr>) the operator must record this on the vehicle maintenance file, stating the date and reason.</p>

<p>The operator must have a robust system in place to make sure they do not use vehicles with <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> status. This is particularly important when the vehicle is unsafe.</p>

<p>An operator can suspend the safety inspection schedule for a vehicle if the period of <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> extends over the next planned safety inspection. Operators often use this for seasonal-use vehicles or vehicles that need extensive repairs.</p>

<p>Operators can only bring a vehicle that has <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> status and has missed the scheduled safety inspection back into service after a safety inspection confirms that it is roadworthy. The operator can reschedule future regular inspections based on the date of this inspection.</p>

<p>The examiner should check a sample of <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> records and compare this against records of actual vehicle usage, which could include tachograph records, vehicle telematics or vehicle schedules. An operator can legitimately move a vehicle with <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> status before it’s brought back into service, for example for a journey to a maintenance facility, MOT inspection or road test after repair.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The examiners should check <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> records, including removed vehicles to establish what vehicles are being used and compare to the operator’s records.</p>

<p>If the operator has no <abbr title="vehicle off the road">VOR</abbr> records, the examiner must establish whether the operator is aware of the requirements and has a robust system in place.</p>

<h3>Question 4f: Is there an effectively managed safety defect and recall system in place?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Operators must act promptly to make sure rectification work is carried out if they receive notification of a safety recall for a vehicle from a manufacturer. This will remove the risk that the potential defect may cause the vehicle to become unsafe to drive or break laws.</p>

<p>Operators must record a vehicle safety recall notification and evidence of rectification on the vehicle maintenance file.</p>

<p>Operators must have a robust system in place to make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles do not have an outstanding vehicle safety recall</li>
  <li>rectification is arranged as soon as possible when they receive a recall notification</li>
</ul>

<p>Operators should normally carry out rectification work at the next scheduled safety inspection, unless parts are unavailable or there is a long lead time for the manufacturer’s workshop.</p>

<p>The operator should take a vehicle out of service immediately if the recall notification is urgent until the safety recall is actioned. They should get advice from the manufacturer about the nature and severity of the recall.</p>

<p>Operators should be aware of how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-recalls-and-faults/report-a-serious-safety-defect">report any potential safety defects to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr></a></li>
  <li>provide evidence that safety defects have been identified, appropriately actioned and reported</li>
</ul>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The examiner must find out if the operator is aware of safety recall requirements and has a robust safety defect system in place, if the operator has no safety recall records or defects.</p>

<h3>Question 4g: Reportable Incidents (PSV112) - is the operator using the incident report form? (for operators with <abbr title="public service vehicles">PSVs</abbr> only)</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>By law, all public service vehicle (<abbr title="public service vehicle">PSV</abbr>) operators must report any incident involving a failure or damage which affects the safety of the passengers or other road users to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>). 
They must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-an-incident-involving-your-organisations-bus-or-coach">Report an incident involving your organisation’s bus or coach</a> form, also known as the PSV112.</p>

<p>Reportable incidents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fatalities</li>
  <li>serious injury (such as broken bones, damage to major organs or overnight hospitalisation)</li>
  <li>a safety critical system failure (such as brake failure or wheel loss)</li>
  <li>a vehicle catching fire (including arson)</li>
  <li>a suspected manufacturing fault of a safety critical component or system</li>
  <li>something that the police have said should be reported to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>significant body damage (such as a bridge strike)</li>
  <li>other applicable reasons</li>
</ul>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>If no reportable incidents or recalls exist, the examiner must find out if the operator is aware of PSV112 incident reporting requirements and has a robust incident reporting and vehicle recall system in place.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Driver defect reporting</h2>

<h3>Question 5a: Are effective walkaround checks being carried out?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>A driver or responsible person must carry out a daily walkaround check, preferably immediately before a vehicle is used.</p>

<p>Drivers must be well-trained and given clear written instructions about their responsibilities</p>

<p>The driver is always legally responsible for the condition of the vehicle while in use. Therefore, conducting a daily walkaround check is an important part of a driver’s job. Operators can arrange for a responsible person to carry out the daily walkaround check. At least one walkaround check must be carried out in any 24-hour period of vehicle use.</p>

<p>It is good practice to have ‘nil defect’ reports as they are a useful means of checking that drivers are carrying out their duties and these forms can be used for audit purposes. A ‘nil defect’ reporting system shows that someone has carried out a walkaround check and is a positive report that the vehicle is free from defects.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner may ask an operator to use a ‘nil defect’ reporting system. Where applicable this should be assessed in Question 12a.</p>

<h3>Question 5b: Is a suitable system being used for drivers to report defects?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Drivers must promptly report any defects or symptoms of defects that could adversely affect the safe operation of vehicles.</p>

<p>The driver or someone responsible for recording defects must write a report of any defects found during the daily walkaround check, while the vehicle is in use or on its return to base.</p>

<p>The details recorded should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicle registration or identification mark</li>
  <li>date</li>
  <li>details of the defects or symptoms</li>
  <li>the reporter’s name</li>
  <li>who the defect was reported to</li>
  <li>assessment of the defect</li>
  <li>rectification work</li>
  <li>date rectification work was completed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Electronic walkaround check system</h4>

<p>The daily walkaround check can be done using a handheld device, and the results stored digitally.</p>

<p>This can include devices like tablets or smartphones, which can be given to the driver or allocated to the vehicle.</p>

<p>The system should also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a suitable method of digital signature</li>
  <li>secure data input and storage</li>
  <li>confirmation that the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition at the start of the journey</li>
  <li>the ability to complete forms by hand and then scan and save them digitally for a backup if the electronic system fails</li>
  <li>easy access to any images captured, by date and vehicle</li>
  <li>the ability to produce the current day’s record, at a minimum, at the roadside</li>
  <li>effective date and time stamping to make sure data is reliable, including ‘nil defect’ reporting where it is included</li>

<h3>Question 5c: Are defects appropriately assessed and repaired?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Drivers should give all defect reports to a responsible person with enough authority to take appropriate action, which may include removing the vehicle from service immediately.</p>

<p>For any defects the operator does not need to repair immediately, the operator should keep a record of why this is with the defect report.</p>

<p>The operator must keep any manual or electronic report listing defects for at least 15 months, along with details of the rectification work and repairer.</p>

<p>Owner-drivers may not have anyone to report defects to, so they should record defects and repairs when they are found and rectified and keep the records for at least 15 months.</p>

<h3>Question 6b: Are the maintenance arrangements/facilities satisfactory?</h3>

<h4>In-house facilities</h4>

<p>Operators who carry out their own safety inspections must have the right tools, facilities and staff for the size of the fleet and type of vehicles operated.</p>

<p>All operators should have access to a means of measuring brake efficiency and setting headlamp aim. Operators should use a diesel smoke meter to test the level of smoke emission from vehicles showing signs of visible exhaust smokes to make sure the level of smoke emission is within legal requirements.</p>

<p>Operators that provide their own safety inspection facilities for contracted inspections must make sure that they are suitable.</p>

<h4>Contractor arrangements</h4>

<p>Operators are responsible for the condition of vehicles and trailers that are inspected or maintained for them by agents, contractors or hire companies.</p>

<p>Operators must make sure that the facilities the contactor uses are adequate and that the staff are competent. They should make sure that the contractor uses up-to-date information and has suitable inspection sheets.</p>

<p>Operators should review maintenance records and have a means of regularly monitoring the quality of work provided by the contractor.</p>

<p>Facilities for both in-house and contracted maintenance should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>undercover accommodation for the largest vehicle in the fleet so that they can carry out safety checks in all types of weather (depending on the fleet size the building may need room for more than one vehicle at a time)</li>
  <li>tools and equipment appropriate to the size and nature of the fleet</li>
  <li>an adequate under-vehicle inspection facility</li>
  <li>adequate lighting</li>
  <li>access to brake test equipment (such as a roller brake tester, decelerometer, temperature sensor) and arrangements for loading the vehicles and trailers to carry out brake tests</li>
  <li>access to headlamp test equipment</li>
  <li>access to emissions testing equipment</li>
  <li>access to steam or pressure under-vehicle washing facilities</li>
  <li>a safe working environment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Safety inspectors</h4>

<p>Someone who carries out safety inspections must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the correct technical skills and training</li>
  <li>know what standards the vehicle must meet</li>
  <li>have up to date knowledge and skills</li>
</ul>

<p>They need to be trained in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicle examination</li>
  <li>vehicle maintenance and repair</li>
  <li>diagnosis</li>
  <li>reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>They must have a good working knowledge of the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> inspection manuals for the types of vehicles they inspect.</p>

<p>A safety inspector can also prove that they are capable of carrying out safety inspections through experience gained over time. They must keep their skills and knowledge up to date.</p>

<p>It’s recommended that your maintenance staff either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get relevant technical qualifications and gain accreditation, for example, through City and Guilds, the Institute of the Motor Industry or irtec</li>
  <li>meet a recognised quality standard for the vehicles they inspect</li>
  <li>carry out continuing professional development (<abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>There must be enough maintenance staff to inspect the fleet and maintain it in a roadworthy condition.</p>

<p>A safety inspector should not be expected to carry out repair or servicing work during the examination. They should list repair work and this should be done after the inspection is complete.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The examiner must establish whether the operator’s maintenance facilities or arrangements are satisfactory. They should record an unsatisfactory outcome if they cannot determine whether contracted maintenance arrangements are adequate.</p>

<h3>Question 6c: Does test history indicate poor management or maintenance standards?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The examiner should review MOT test results to establish whether maintenance standards are satisfactory. Failure of safety-critical defects, multiple failure items, multiple retests and repeated pass with rectification (PRS) failures would indicate poor maintenance standards.</p>

<p>The examiner will consider management unsatisfactory if a vehicle or trailer has been operated without a statutory annual test or with the incorrect test class certificate.</p>

<p>The examiner will set the investigation reason to most serious infringement (<abbr title="most serious infringement">MSI</abbr>) if the operator has been or is reported for prosecution for this offence, which will automatically default to report the operator to the traffic commissioners.</p>

<p>If prosecution action is not being considered and if there is clear evidence that a vehicle or trailer is deliberately being used without the correct annual test , this should be reported directly to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain.</p>

<p>The examiner must use final fail rate percentage for this assessment by removing pass with rectification (PRS) failures from initial test fail rate.</p>

<p>Prohibitions or variations are assessed in Question 10a.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The examiner will enter “not known” if there is no record of test history. The examiner must add comments to the maintenance investigation visit report.</p>

<p>Operators must make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vehicles used on local or scheduled bus and coach services that can carry more than 22 passengers meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accessible-buses-and-coaches">Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>) 2000</a>
</li>
  <li>vehicles that meet the standards have an accessibility certificate (PSVA2)</li>
</ul>

<p>To get an accessibility certificate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>buses must meet schedules 1 and 2 of the regulations</li>
  <li>coaches must meet schedules 1 and 3 of the regulations</li>
</ul>

<h4>Local service</h4>

<p>A local service is a bus service where passengers are carried at separate fares over short distances. The route can be of any distance, as long as passengers can get off within 15 miles of the point where they boarded the vehicle.</p>

<p>Most local services operate to a timetable and are registered with the traffic commissioner. Some services are exempt from registration, such as local authority education provider school services and rail replacement services.</p>

<p>Passengers can pay fares to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the driver</li>
  <li>the vehicle operator</li>
  <li>a school</li>
  <li>a local authority</li>
  <li>a train operator</li>
</ul>

<p>Some home to school and rail replacement services may have a temporary exemption from <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>. The exemption certificate (also called a ‘special authorisation’) must be kept on the vehicle or with the driver. Operators must follow the conditions of the exemption.</p>

<h4>Scheduled service</h4>

<p>A scheduled service uses one or more buses or coaches to carry passengers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>along specific routes</li>
  <li>at specified times</li>
  <li>with passengers getting on and getting off at pre-determined stopping points</li>
</ul>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The operator must have a robust system to make sure vehicles used on local or scheduled services meet <abbr title="Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations">PSVAR</abbr>, if the vehicle can carry more than 22 passengers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Prohibition Assessment</h2>

<h3>Question 10a: Do any of the prohibitions issued to the operator during the required sample period demonstrate a weakness or significant failing of the maintenance system?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The examiner must assess all roadworthiness prohibitions issued during the sample period.</p>

<p>These include the operator’s roadside enforcement encounters, the current fleet check and prohibitions issued at annual test.</p>

<p>For third party trailers where the operator was not responsible for the safety inspection, the examiner must check if the driver would not have been aware of the defect either with a walkaround check, system warning or by towing the trailer.</p>

<h4>Sample period</h4>

<p>The encounters the examiner will check are for the most recent out of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period since the last public inquiry where roadworthiness prohibitions were considered</li>
  <li>the period since the last maintenance investigation fleet check</li>
  <li>the last 3 years of encounters and tests</li>
</ul>

<p>The examiner will record the sample period in Question 10b.</p>

<p>The examiner must check any prohibitions and records reviewed by a desk-based assessment by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>) remote enforcement office as part of the prohibition assessment.</p>

<h4>Prohibition endorsement (initial encounter)</h4>

<p>Against each defect, it is necessary to categorise its significance in terms of roadworthiness compliance and maintenance as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘S’ for significant failure of roadworthiness compliance</li>
  <li>(Blank) for defects which may or may not be attributable to poor maintenance</li>
  <li>‘X’ where the defect is no reflection on the maintenance system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roadworthiness prohibitions, both immediate and delayed, should be endorsed ‘S’ if, in the examiner’s opinion, any of the defects which led to the prohibition were an indicator that there is significant failure of roadworthiness compliance. These are defects that the operator and driver should have been aware of through any or all of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is a long-standing defect that should have been detected and repaired at the last safety check</li>
  <li>the defect or issue should have been detected at the first use or daily walk round check</li>
  <li>performance, handling or warning systems would have made the defect obvious to the driver</li>
  <li>poor workmanship should have been apparent to the repairer</li>
  <li>the nature of defects observed at the annual test was such that they should have been found before the vehicle was presented for test</li>
  <li>the number and nature of defects present on this notice indicate a significant failure in maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘X’ category, for defects(s) not considered to be maintenance related, is appropriate for defects of an entirely random failure nature such as a lighting bulb failure or a new fracture in a road spring leaf, where it is also apparent that it would not have been noticed by the driver.</p>

<p>The defect is not endorsed when it is not possible to determine whether a defect is attributable to poor maintenance and whether or not the operator, driver or the maintenance arrangements are at fault.</p>

<p>An investigation generated from a roadworthiness most serious infringement (<abbr title="most serious infringement">MSI</abbr>) must be reported to the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain, regardless of the maintenance investigation outcome.</p>

<p>A roadworthiness <abbr title="most serious infringement">MSI</abbr> is a penalty or conviction incurred by the transport manager or operator as a result of using a vehicle with a dangerous defect associated with either brakes, steering, wheels, tyres or suspension. A category 1 ‘S’ endorsed prohibition would generate an <abbr title="most serious infringement">MSI</abbr> investigation.</p>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

<p>The examiner must confirm prohibitions that have been endorsed either ‘S’ or ‘X’ by checking the operator’s records and maintenance system.</p>

<p>Prohibitions which have not been endorsed can be given an appropriate endorsement assessment (S or X), with supporting evidence from a review of the operator’s maintenance records and system during this investigation.</p>

<p>The examiner should note details of any confirmed prohibition endorsement, or amendment to the endorsement marking in the comments on the <abbr title="maintenance investigation visit report">MIVR</abbr> (Q10a).</p>

<h4>Confirmed trends</h4>

<p>The examiner should review the prohibition history over the sample period to confirm that prohibitions have been issued on multiple occasions for safety critical defects.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Security Requirements</h2>

<h3>Question 11a: Does the operator have appropriate vehicle and site security procedures in place?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Vehicles on UK roads could be targeted or stolen by individuals for use in an attack.</p>

<p>The operator should have systems in place to promote a good security culture and help keep vehicles secure and employees safe.</p>

<p>The system needs to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>security culture, including pre-employment checks for staff and drivers</li>
  <li>site security, including vehicle access and operating centres</li>
  <li>vehicle security, including checking vehicles and what to do if someone takes a vehicle</li>
</ul>

<h4>Site security</h4>

<p>Effective security measures at operating centres and maintenance facilities can help to create a controlled environment which will encourage positive security behaviours amongst staff and act as a deterrent, protecting the facilities and assets from theft and other potential criminal activity.</p>

<p>Basic security measures can help prevent unauthorised access to a vehicle when it is left unattended at unsecured premises, for example maintenance workshops or operating centres.</p>

<p>Having clear signage in place can discourage unwanted access by vehicles and people. Security measures can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fitting locks or tamper-proof seals to lockers and equipment boxes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>controlling access to operating centres with appropriate security arrangements, such as fences, gates, security codes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>storing vehicle keys in a secure locker with security codes, not left in vehicles or on hooks in the office easily accessible to anyone</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Vehicle security</h4>

<p>Operators and drivers should follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bus-and-coach-security-recommended-best-practice">bus and coach security: best practice</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-guidance-for-goods-vehicle-operators-and-drivers">security guidance for goods vehicle operators and drivers</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Drivers should visually check their vehicle at the beginning and end of their journey.</p>

<p>Also, whenever they leave or return to their vehicle, they should look for any signs that something has been concealed or the vehicle tampered with.</p>

<p>Vehicles should not be left unattended at the roadside with the ignition running.</p>

<p>Ignition keys should not be left in the vehicle whilst the driver is not present.</p>

<p>Alternative security measures should be considered for vehicles not requiring an ignition key.</p>

<p>Security measures should be put in place at bus and coach stations to prevent unauthorised access to vehicles.</p>

<p>Drivers and bus and coach operators should report any concerns about unusual behaviour that occurs on or close to their vehicle.</p>

<h3>Question 11b: Does the operator have suitable workplace security procedures in place?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Vehicles on UK roads could be targeted or stolen by individuals for use in an attack.</p>

<p>The operator should have procedures in place to promote a good security culture in their organisation and help keep employees safe.</p>

<p>Operators can follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-guidance-for-goods-vehicle-operators-and-drivers">security guidance for goods vehicles and drivers</a>.</p>

<h5>Security culture</h5>

<p>A security culture is a set of values, shared by everyone in an organisation, that determine how people are expected to think about and approach security.</p>

<p>Operators should carry out robust pre-employment checks for all employees. There is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/pre-employment-screening" rel="external">advice on employment screening from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure</a>.</p>

<h4>Company security plan</h4>

<p>A security plan is the cornerstone of a secure goods vehicle operation and sets the basis for strong security behaviours, culture and practice. A company security plan, which can take the form of a risk assessment, should cover the items listed in the guide referenced below.</p>

<h3>Question 12a: Have previously reported shortcomings been identified during this investigation, including any breach of conditions or undertakings?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The examiner needs to check any conditions or undertakings on the licence.</p>

<p>The examiner should review the last public inquiry or previous maintenance investigation report (MIR) or remote enforcement desk-based assessment (DBA), within the past 5 years, to establish whether the operator has previously been made aware of any of the current shortcomings identified in this investigation.</p>

<p>The review should look at any assurances given by the operator to address the issues raised and check that the operator is complying with any undertakings or conditions on the licence.</p>

<p>The examiner should assess any written decisions from a public inquiry and any responses by the operator to requests for explanation (<abbr title="Request for Explanation">RFE</abbr>) resulting from previous maintenance investigation reports or remote enforcement desk-based assessments.</p>

<h3>Question 13b: Does the transport manager/responsible person have relevant continuing professional development (<abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr>)?</h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The transport manager should carry out continuous professional development (<abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr>), as well as having a certificate of professional competence (<abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr>) or acquired rights.</p>

<p>The responsible person should also carry out <abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> to make sure they are able to carry out their duties effectively, such as operator licence awareness training.</p>

<p><abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> can take many forms such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>training courses</li>
  <li>workshops</li>
  <li>attending transport conferences and events</li>
  <li>e-learning programmes</li>
</ul>

<p>For <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> holders, if it has been more than 5 years since the last <abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> was undertaken the starting point for evidence would be the completion of a 2-day transport manager <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> refresher course, run by a trade association (including Logistics UK, <abbr title="Road Haulage Association">RHA</abbr>, British Association of Removers, and Confederation of Passenger Transport), a professional body (including the Institute of Transport Administration, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, the Society of Operations Engineers and <abbr title="Institute of Road Transport Engineers">IRTE</abbr>) or an approved exam centre offering the relevant transport manager <abbr title="certificate of professional competence">CPC</abbr> qualification for the type of licence held.</p>

<p>Transport managers will need to provide evidence of their continuing professional development when an operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first applies for an operator licence and a transport manager has not been specified in the last 5 years</li>
  <li>first applies for an operator licence and the transport manager’s qualification is over 10 years old</li>
  <li>applies for an operator licence and a transport manager is proposing to be on more than one licence or when the proposed hours are less than the starting point</li>
  <li>renews their operator licence</li>
</ul>

<p>The responsible person must attend a suitable course such as example operator licence awareness training if there is no evidence of <abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>The transport manager or responsible person should prove any <abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> and evidence should be available.</p>
