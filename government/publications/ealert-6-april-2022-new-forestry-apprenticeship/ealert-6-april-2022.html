<span class="number">1. </span>England Woodland Creation Offer Application Form top tips</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Over the coming weeks we’ll be sharing some advice on how you should complete the EWCO Application Form so that we have all the information we need to process your application.</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Tip 3: Check whether you need an Agent Authority Form</p>

<p>If your EWCO application involves an agent acting on behalf of the lead applicant, you must give your permission by submitting a Forestry Commission Agent Authority Form (V4) alongside your application documents. As of January 2022 we cannot accept V3 for new EWCO applications.</p>

<p>You can sign this form electronically using a link which we will send you on request or with an original handwritten signature in ink:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you wish to sign electronically please complete the form without a signature and date, and email it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:aafes@forestrycommission.gov.uk">aafes@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>If you have signed the form by hand, please send your completed and signed form to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:EWCO@forestrycommission.gov.uk">EWCO@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">2. </span>Change to EWCO - NfC Social GIS Targeting and Scoring layer</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Find out if this change will impact your application.</h3>

<p>The Geographical Information Systems (GIS) layer used for targeting woodland creation and scoring applications for the England Woodland Creation Offer (EWCO) for social benefits has changed. This affects the eligibility of applications for the two social Additional Contributions (ACs): close to settlements and public access.</p>

<p>Applications received before 16 May 2022 which were eligible for these ACs before the layer changed will remain eligible for them. From 16 May 2022, only schemes that fall within the published layer will be eligible.</p>

<p>The EWCO - NfC Social layer can be viewed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.forestergis.com/Apps/MapBrowser/" rel="external">Forestry Commission’s Map Browser</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>A first-of-its-kind apprenticeship initiative to foster a growing, highly skilled and more diverse workforce within the forestry sector is now open for applications.</h3>

<p>The Development Woodland Officer programme offers a three-year, paid development opportunity for passionate individuals looking to kickstart their careers in forestry. Jointly led by the Forestry Commission, the University of Cumbria and the Institute of Chartered Foresters, the programme marks the first time that a degree-level forestry apprenticeship has been offered in the UK.</p>

<p>Development Woodland Officers will benefit from academic studies in forestry management at the University of Cumbria, practical experience in Forestry Commission area teams across England, and nine months of wider sector placements to further build their skills and experience, enhancing future employment prospects.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the programme, successful graduates will earn a Professional Forester Apprenticeship (equivalent to Level 6), a BSc (hons) in Forest Management and the potential to gain Chartered Forester status with the Institute of Chartered Foresters.</p>

<p>Find out if you are eligible and how to apply on our GOV.UK page: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-forestry-apprenticeship">Apply for a Forestry Apprenticeship</a>. The deadline for applications is 8 May 2022.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>James Cup winners: Forest Resilience. Part 2. Practical considerations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>We are proud to be the winners of the James Cup for best original article in the Quarterly Journal of Forestry - awarded by the Royal Forestry Society.</h3>

<p>Co-authored by Eleanor Tew, Rob Coventry, Emily Fensom and Chris Sorensen  (a collaboration between the forest resilience teams of the Forestry Commission and Forestry England).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://rfs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tew-et-al-July-2021-QJF.pdf" rel="external">The winning article</a> explores key considerations for increasing forest resilience and gives practical advice, including a comprehensive list of further resources. It also featured two case studies from the nation’s forests about how resilience is being increased following tree disease – Sherwood (Central District) and Thetford Forest (East District).</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Tree Production Capital Grant</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Funding support to increase the quantity, quality, diversity and biosecurity of tree, seed and sapling supply.</h3>

<p>The Forestry Commission will open a new Tree Production Capital Grant this Spring. The Tree Production Capital Grant (TPCG) will provide funding to increase the domestic production of tree seed and saplings, supporting investments in expansion, automation and mechanisation of facilities and equipment. This will help improve not only the quantity but also the quality, diversity, and biosecurity of supply.</p>

<p>The TPCG is designed to help seed and sapling suppliers of all sizes, from established nurseries to smaller nurseries and new entrants looking to diversify into the sector. Any public, private, or third sector organisation who will use the funding to support their production of tree seed or saplings is encouraged to apply.</p>

<p>Applicants will be able to apply for up to 50% of the costs for capital projects and equipment such as: intelligent transplanting systems; polytunnel infrastructure and equipment; irrigation systems and infrastructure; seed trays; grading machines; biosecurity investments such as water treatment and refrigeration equipment.</p>

<p>The grant will enable suppliers to bolster production at pace and has been designed to complement the innovation outputs of the Tree Production Innovation Fund, which provides support for research projects that will enhance UK tree production methods.</p>

<p>To be eligible for funding, applicants must be UK-based and will need to demonstrate how the grant will be used to increase English tree seed or sapling supply.</p>

<p>For more information, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:tpcg@forestrycommission.gov.uk">tpcg@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a> or read our latest blog: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/04/05/introducing-the-new-tree-production-capital-grant/" rel="external">Introducing the new Tree Production Capital Grant</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Hundreds have already volunteered to help undertake a tree canopy cover assessment</h3>

<p>On 9 April 2022 Forest Research along with other partners will be holding a ‘mapathon’ in which hundreds of volunteers will undertake online tree canopy cover assessments of urban council wards across the UK. The aim is to complete the first ever UK-wide map of urban tree cover at council ward level (further project details are available).</p>

<p>On the day: there are two sessions - one at 10:00am and one at 2:00pm. You can join either or both. Forest Research and Woodland Trust staff will give an introduction to the project in both sessions and will be on hand throughout the day to help people undertaking canopy cover assessments. No specialist knowledge required.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://woodlandtrust-org-uk.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_KjH91ZdFQuOKXDtyhkVt5g" rel="external">Please register to volunteer for the mapathon.</a></p>
