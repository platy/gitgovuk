<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention, report to local police and engage a lawyer following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you come to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are safe.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>go to the nearest police station</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-Khartoum">British Embassy in Khartoum</a>: phone: +249 156 775500</li>
</ul>

<p>Anything you tell us will be treated in the strictest confidence. If you want us to, we can contact your family or friends on your behalf.</p>

<h3>What the Embassy can do:</h3>

<p>We will try to see you and offer you support as soon as possible and in private. We will be polite, patient and sensitive. We will listen, take what you tell us seriously and be non-judgemental.</p>

<p>We will treat anything you tell us in confidence. We will only pass on information to other agencies (such as the police) and your friends or family if/when you tell us to.</p>

<p>We can tell you about local police, medical and legal procedures. However, only you can decide whether to report the incident to the police or take legal action – we cannot make this decision for you. We will stand by and support with whatever you decide.</p>

<p>If you want to contact the police, we may be able to accompany you to the police station. Unfortunately, there are very few female police officers in Sudan, but you can ask for one. If there is a female police officer at that station, you might have to wait until she is available. You may not be given somewhere private to wait.</p>

<p>We can contact your family or friends, or liaise with an insurance company, if you ask us to.</p>

<p>We can give you information on what support is available locally and in the UK, both for you and for your family.</p>

<p>Your safety and health are paramount. We will support you with whatever you decide and provide you with information and advice about local procedures. The Embassy cannot make decisions for you but support you with whatever you decide.</p>

<p>Although we cannot recommend lawyers or doctors, we do have a list of English-speaking lawyers and medical facilities in Sudan for your convenience:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/Sudan-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sudan-list-of-medical-facilities">medical facilities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We can help with informal translations such as when you attend the police station or the hospital, but our consular officers cannot provide formal interpretation services of court/legal proceedings or medical reports. If you require these services, you can appoint someone through your lawyer or hire an independent translator. There is also a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-translation-centres-in-khartoum">list of translators in Sudan</a> on GOV.UK for your convenience.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Sudan</h2>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible so forensic evidence is not destroyed. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing at the time of the incident to the police. You should try to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms and toothbrushes. Try also to keep any other evidence that might be helpful such as text messages.</p>

<p>You can approach the police directly either by the emergency telephone number 999, or in person at a police station. You can also ask them to inform the British Consulate by dialling +249 156 7755700 and we will provide you with consular support. If you have a tour operator, they might be able to arrange someone to support you or you may go with a friend or relative.</p>

<p>If you do not have a tour operator, you can contact the British Embassy at + 2490156775500. They may try and arrange a consular officer to accompany you to the police station, if practically possible.</p>

<p>When you report the incident, the police will interview you about what happened and take a statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very few police officers speak fluent English. The police will usually allocate an interpreter for you if you do not speak Arabic, but you will usually have to wait a while for one to be available once they request one.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of female representation and language barriers, the situation might not always be handled in a sensitive manner. Consular staff from the Embassy will try and be there to support you if you wish.</p>

<p>Whilst Consular staff can help you make a police report, they cannot provide interpreting or translation of legal or medical reports.&nbsp;The authorities will usually arrange a translator for you or you can appoint a translator of your choosing.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Sudan</h2>

<p>The British Embassy will still be able to help you. This includes helping you arrange to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and provide you with information on local support in the UK. They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to them and ask for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<p>If you don’t report the crime while you are in Sudan there is a risk of it not being investigated as there may be insufficient forensic evidence.</p>

<p>You can still receive medical treatment but you will need to pay for it yourself if you choose not to make a formal report.</p>

<p>A forensic examination won’t be carried out unless you report the crime to the police.</p>

<h2>Reporting the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>If you want to file the report from the UK you may be able to do so and this would be via the police in the UK. If there is sufficient evidence, the Sudanese Authorities may decide to prosecute without you being present, although you can request to attend the hearing if you wish. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction or not.</p>

<p>UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Sudan: what to expect</h2>

<p>The deadline for filing rape incident report according to statute of limitations is five (5) years for suit initiation, but the sooner you do it, the greater the chances of obtaining the necessary evidence and the case going to trial. Once a report is made, usually in English Language and then translated into Arabic Language, you will be asked to sign your statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be expected to give an account of what happened in detail and if possible, you will be asked to identify the perpetrator. Tell the police investigator if you think you have been drugged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The types of questions that you will be asked include: the identity of the assailant, a description of what happened, and where and when the incident took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be asked to read your statement, or an interpreter will read it back to you to check if the information is correct and then you will have to sign it. Your report will then be sent to the district attorney’s office (the Prosecutor) for review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police will usually keep any clothes you were wearing and hand them to the court in a sealed plastic bag. The clothing is usually sent to a forensic examiner to be used as evidence in court; it is unlikely your clothing will be returned to you.&nbsp;The police will not provide a change of clothing if you are wearing clothes you were assaulted in so do take a change of clothing with you if you can.</p>

<p>You will be asked to undergo medical examination, referred to as a forensic examination, at a local government hospital. The results of the examination will be recorded. It’s purpose is to obtain evidence to support your case by noting bruising, scratches and any other forms of injury.&nbsp;An officer will accompany you to receive a copy of the official medical report, which will be passed to the court for the Prosecutor. Based on the findings of the report the Prosecutor may request a further forensic examination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can ask for a copy of the medical report (Form – 8) and suit number.</p>

<h3>The medical examination: what to expect</h3>

<p>A medical examination is requested by the police officer following reporting of the incident to the police.</p>

<p>In most areas of Sudan, medical examinations and forensic tests are carried out in a government hospital, which is free of charge. The evidence is then sent to the court. The examination can be carried out in a private hospital if you prefer, but you will be expected to pay.</p>

<p>Wherever possible and if you wish, a member of the consular team will try to accompany you to the hospital. Some hospital staff do speak English, but many will not, and the situation might not be handled as sensitively as you might expect.</p>

<p>Following disclosure of rape/assault, a forensic doctor is usually appointed by the prosecutor to carry out an additional examination with the assistance of a nurse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses are predominantly female in Sudan.</p>

<p>The forensic examination will usually involve an internal examination to obtain evidence of a sexual act and a full external examination to obtain evidence of any force and/or violence. It may also be necessary to undertake swabs and DNA testing.</p>

<p>The timescales for obtaining forensic evidence vary depending on the type of assault. For mouth or digital penetration, the forensic time scale is usually within two days, for anal penetration within three days is usually the maximum. For vaginal penetration, the time scale is up to seven days. However, the sooner an examination is carried out, the stronger the forensic evidence will be.</p>

<p>STI tests, including HIV tests are not performed as a routine part of the procedure, but you can ask that these tests be carried out. Results are usually available within approximately three days, based on the type of test.</p>

<p>If the results show that you have been exposed to any sexually transmitted diseases, you may require treatment. You will have to pay for any prescription medication. You may be able to claim expenses back from your travel insurance.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception must be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. In Sudan, you can obtain emergency contraception from a doctor’s surgery or a hospital. You will need to pay for this but you may be able to claim expenses back from your travel insurance.&nbsp;If you have trouble accessing emergency contraception, contact the Embassy.</p>

<p>You can also request an HIV test. HIV post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a treatment that can prevent HIV Infection. HIV PEP medication should be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. If not taken, the NHS may be able to start or continue a 28-day treatment on return to the UK.&nbsp;If you want to take this medication straight away, you will need to visit a private clinic and pay for the treatment. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sudan-list-of-medical-facilities">list of clinics</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot wait for the results of the tests and you are concerned that you may have been exposed to any sexually transmitted infections, then you may wish to consider visiting a hospital.</p>

<p>If medication is prescribed, you should keep a copy of the label or make a note of the name of the medication so that you can let your doctor know.</p>

<p>The forensic report will not be given to you. It will be sent to the prosecutor. Your appointed lawyer will be able to request a copy of the report and share it with you.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>The investigation stage is led by the Prosecutor at the court. The police will pass any information to the court and therefore, all requests for updates must be directed to the criminal court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are a non-Arabic speaker, the court should recall an interpreter, or you can appoint one, although you will have to pay for this yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your case is referred for further investigation, you may be required to provide additional evidence(s) and/or give an additional statement when you will be asked to go over your statement about the incident.</p>

<p>During the investigation, the Prosecutor may ask for the clothes you were wearing during the incident. They may also take you to the crime scene. This will be to prove the criminal charge by analysing forensic evidence found at the crime scene. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify perpetrators in many crimes, particularly rapes, by examining the genetic print.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before an arrest can take place, the Public Prosecutor must be informed. The Public Prosecutor’s Office then appoints one or more police investigators to carry out a further investigation.&nbsp;Once identified, the suspect will be held in custody, and then sent to court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be expected to go in front of the Public Prosecutor to make a statement. The alleged perpetrator is not brought into the hearing unless permitted by the prosecutor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you decide to leave Sudan while the case is still under investigation you may be required to appoint a proxy to represent you with valid power-of-attorney for various case proceedings. We recommend you appoint a local Sudanese lawyer to follow your case and obtain updates for you.</p>

<h2>Trial procedures</h2>

<p>Sudanese judicial procedures can be lengthy and drawn out especially if your assailant is not immediately identifiable and/or arrested soon after the assault/rape.</p>

<p>The time it takes for a case to come to trial can vary and depend on workload of the court with other cases. On average, we would expect it to start within three (3) months of the prosecutor informing you that a trial will go ahead but there is no set time and the case could take longer.</p>

<p>The trial will be conducted in Arabic language and your lawyer is expected to be present.</p>

<p>The trial usually includes the judge, the prosecutor, lawyers, the perpetrator and the victim, however the victim does not always need to be present and your lawyer can follow the case on your behalf. The judge presides over the trial.</p>

<p>How long a trial takes will vary depending on how much evidence is available and the complexity of the case. However, the average length of a trial is around six (6) months.</p>

<p>The prosecutor is principally in charge of leading the investigation. At the end of the investigation phase when all necessary reports and statements have been completed, the prosecutor in charge of the investigation and the Chief Prosecutor will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. If so, the case will be passed to a trial court and will be presided over by one judge and the prosecutor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be asked to testify at the start of the trial and at other times if there is a need for further evidence. If you are no longer in the country, we have known the courts to ask further questions through the UK police or ask that you come back to attend a session of the trial. The Sudanese authorities do not assist with travel or accommodation payments or arrangements.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to return to Sudan, please be aware that there is no way to testify from the UK. There are no video conferencing facilities or other forms of remote access. It is rare however for a victim to be called back to court to provide evidence. Your appointed proxy can represent you with valid power-of-attorney.</p>

<p>Once a verdict is reached it can take up to (30) days for the sentence to be passed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are not present, your agent (proxy) or your lawyer, who should be following your case, will notify you of the verdict.</p>

<h2>Hiring a lawyer</h2>

<p>A private lawyer will represent your interests before the court.</p>

<p>A lawyer will be able to access the pre-trial information held by the court including the statements provided by the defendant.</p>

<p>If you instruct an English-speaking private lawyer, you will be informed in English about the progress of the investigation and court proceedings.</p>

<p>The Sudanese Ministry of Justice (Legal Aid Office) may provide state appointed lawyers for victims of crimes, some civil society originations and/or pro-bono lawyers beside the Prosecutor can represent the victim, but if the perpetrator does not have a lawyer, they will be appointed by the state.</p>

<p>If you do not hire a lawyer, you will not have legal representation. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sudan-list-of-lawyers">list of lawyers</a>.</p>

<h3>Legal aid</h3>

<p>Legal aid is available in Sudan via Ministry of Justice (Legal Aid Office) and some civil society organisations and/or pro-bono lawyers.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot provide financial assistance to help pay for legal advice or representation.</p>

<h2>Sentencing</h2>

<p>Sentences in Sudan are ruled by the principle of punishment.</p>

<p>Sexual offences are generally punishable with a prison sentence, usually not exceeding (10) years.</p>

<p>Some rape and sexual assaults carry the death penalty, for instance where rape constitutes the offence of adultery or sodomy. This would depend on the nature of the crime. For example, child sexual abuse and those carried out by a relative, carry the most severe punishments.</p>

<p>The length of the prison sentence will depend on the classification and legal definition of the crime. This may differ from UK definitions.</p>

<p>In the absence of sufficient proof, perpetrators of rape may still be prosecuted for gross indecency under Article (151) of the Criminal Act 1991, crime that may be proved by circumstantial evidence. However, the definition of the offence of gross indecency neither captures the heinous nature of rape nor provides for adequate punishment (imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine).</p>

<p>If the alleged perpetrator is found not guilty, they are released and there is no criminal responsibility.</p>

<p>Depending on the investigation, other provisional measures may be applied for. Your lawyer can request a restraining order and the judge will decide if this is appropriate to implement.</p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<p>The offender can be ordered to pay compensation once they are convicted.</p>

<p>You may also be able to claim back losses depending on where the crime occurred. Ask your lawyer to advise you about compensation and how to apply.</p>

<p>There is no state-funded compensation scheme in Sudan.</p>

<h2>Returning to the UK</h2>

<p>On return to the UK, you may want to let your GP, or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if previously tested in Sudan. It is worth noting that the Sudanese police will not inform the UK police of the crime.</p>
