<p>10 June 2022</p>

<p>Dear Sir Iain</p>

<p>Risks to UK from Chinese State-Controlled Surveillance</p>

<p>I write further to&nbsp;the event at which we both spoke on the above&nbsp;subject earlier this week.</p>

<p>I would begin by endorsing your characterisation of the breadth and depth of the risks, their provenance and, most importantly perhaps,&nbsp;the&nbsp;urgency&nbsp;they now call for. &nbsp;The key question,&nbsp;as we on the panel agreed,&nbsp;remains what is to be done about them.</p>

<p>For my part, my correspondence with&nbsp;the relevant companies&nbsp;-&nbsp;and also with&nbsp;government departments&nbsp;-&nbsp;on&nbsp;this matter is&nbsp;all in the public domain but has&nbsp;yet to&nbsp;produce&nbsp;any&nbsp;discernible&nbsp;action.&nbsp;While the arguments deployed in this debate embrace a wide spectrum of issues, from my perspective as Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner the&nbsp;matter can&nbsp;be simplified to one of trust. &nbsp;The use of biometric surveillance by the state is a matter of increasing sensitivity and significant public concern - not just here but globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;As almost all of the technological capability for biometric surveillance is privately owned, the only way we will&nbsp;as a nation&nbsp;be able to harness the&nbsp;many&nbsp;legitimate uses of that technology in the future is in trusted partnership with trusted private sector partners.</p>

<p>In short, the people we trust - the police, fire and rescue, local&nbsp;authorities and&nbsp;the government itself -&nbsp;must&nbsp;be able to trust their technology partners, both in terms of security and&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;shared&nbsp;ethical and professional values.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the publicly available evidence&nbsp;tells me that some of these companies &nbsp;- notably Hikvision and Dahua - simply cannot be trusted, partly because of concerns about the role they and their technology are believed to have played in perpetuating the appalling treatment&nbsp;of Uyghur Muslims as set out in the report of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee last year&nbsp;(and recognised in the government’s formal response), but&nbsp;also because of those companies’ absolute refusal to engage with even the most cursory level of public accountability in response to those concerns.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;report by Big Brother Watch&nbsp;has corroborated what the surveillance community has known for some time: that almost every aspect of our lives is now under surveillance&nbsp;using&nbsp;advanced systems designed by, and purchased from, companies under the control of other governments, governments to whom those companies have data sharing obligations&nbsp;within&nbsp;their own domestic legal framework. &nbsp;The proliferation of&nbsp;these systems&nbsp;means&nbsp;we have&nbsp;a public surveillance infrastructure&nbsp;built on ‘digital asbestos’&nbsp;requiring both&nbsp;considerable caution when&nbsp;handling the&nbsp;products&nbsp;installed by a previous generation and, as a priority,&nbsp;a moratorium on any further installation&nbsp;until we fully understand the risks&nbsp;we have created.</p>

<p>I have been assured by ministers that these issues will be addressed in the Public Procurement Bill currently before Parliament and it is my sincere hope that&nbsp;any&nbsp;subsequent legislation&nbsp;will be sufficiently&nbsp;comprehensive,&nbsp;not just&nbsp;to address&nbsp;the&nbsp;letting of new public surveillance contracts,&nbsp;but&nbsp;also&nbsp;to reinforce&nbsp;the fidelity of&nbsp;our&nbsp;country’s&nbsp;critical&nbsp;surveillance infrastructure in its entirety.</p>

<p>I will shortly be conducting a survey across police and local authorities to identify how many are relying on these surveillance systems but this will only inform a small part of the picture; what is ultimately needed is a full inventory across our critical national infrastructure.</p>

<p>To my mind this is not about interfering in another country’s domestic affairs; this is about reinforcing the legitimate expectations in ours.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Professor Fraser Sampson<br>
Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner</p>
