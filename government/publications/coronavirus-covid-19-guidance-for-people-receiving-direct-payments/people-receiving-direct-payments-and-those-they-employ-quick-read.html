<p>This document sets out the 7 most important things that direct payments holders, local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>), clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>), and those who provide care and support, including personal assistants, should know during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<p>There’s more information in the full <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-people-receiving-direct-payments/coronavirus-covid-19-qa-for-people-receiving-a-personal-budget-or-personal-health-budget" class="govuk-link">guidance for people receiving direct payments and personal assistants</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Direct payments should continue as before</h2>

<p>They will not be stopped as a result of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Direct payments are still as important as any other type of care and support.</p>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> must make every effort to ensure that people’s budgets and direct payments are maintained and supported.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Open communication is very important</h2>

<p><abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> will proactively communicate with all direct payment holders to ensure they stay safe and are assured about the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>’s concern for their wellbeing.</p>

<p>Direct payment holders should have a point of contact at their <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> who can support and advise them when needed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> The government expects direct payments to be used as flexibly as possible to manage any issues arising from COVID-19, as set out in regulations</h2>

<p>This is very important so that people can stay safe and receive the care and support they need.</p>

<p>Where necessary, for example in an emergency or when it’s time-critical, this may result in a varied care and support plan that is put into action without direct approval from the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>, on the basis that it is the right and reasonable thing to do so people stay safe and receive the care and support they need.</p>

<p>Receipts should be kept, and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> should be informed how the direct payment has been used during that time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-people-receiving-direct-payments/coronavirus-covid-19-qa-for-people-receiving-a-personal-budget-or-personal-health-budget" class="govuk-link">See examples of how direct payments have been used more flexibly during this time in the full guidance.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> All personal care assistants are considered key workers, both now and in the future</h2>

<p>This means they’re eligible for things like free winter flu vaccinations and PPE.</p>

<p>Personal care assistants should also be able to support individuals when accessing supermarkets and shops, on the basis that they provide people with important care and support.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>  If you are a personal assistant supporting adults over 18 in England, you can access regular testing</h2>

<p>For testing purposes, we have defined a personal assistant as someone who is directly employed by an individual (or self-employed) to provide care and support to enable them to live as independently as possible.</p>

<p>This care could include support in the home, or to go out into the community. All personal assistants who provide care that requires them to come within 2 metres of the person they support and who support adults over the age of 18 are eligible for regular testing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Anybody with coronavirus symptoms, including unpaid carers and personal care assistants, can get a test</h2>

<p>This includes home tests, delivered to their door.</p>

<p>Coronavirus symptoms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have symptoms, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a test</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> All <abbr title="personal assistants">PAs</abbr> are now eligible for a free winter flu vaccination from their GP or a local community pharmacy</h2>

<p>Direct payment recipients should ensure that the <abbr title="personal assistants">PAs</abbr> they employ are aware of the free flu vaccination and understand how to get it. This includes making sure that their <abbr title="personal assistants">PAs</abbr> receive the proof of entitlement which can be found within the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flu-immunisation-for-social-care-staff/personal-care-assistants-guidance-for-free-flu-vaccination" class="govuk-link">guidance for free flu vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>Neither individuals nor their <abbr title="personal assistants">PAs</abbr> will have to pay for the flu vaccination for <abbr title="personal assistants">PAs</abbr>, it will be paid for by the NHS Complementary Scheme.</p>

<p>There’s more information on each of the points above in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-people-receiving-direct-payments/coronavirus-covid-19-qa-for-people-receiving-a-personal-budget-or-personal-health-budget" class="govuk-link">full direct payment guidance</a>.</p>
