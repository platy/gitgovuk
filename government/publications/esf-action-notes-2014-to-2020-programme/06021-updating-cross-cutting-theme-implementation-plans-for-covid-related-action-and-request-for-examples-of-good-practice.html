<span class="number">1. </span>Who should read</h2>

<p>All <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded projects, <abbr title="Co-Financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr> and <abbr title="Intermediate Bodies">IBs</abbr></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>To remind projects that their equal opportunities and sustainable development implementation plans need to show how equality and sustainability have been taken into account since the COVID-19 pandemic. The plans should reflect any mitigating action taken to support delivery and or access to provision and describe any future action planned in light of the COVID-19 pandemic (that is, where it has had a bearing or impact on promoting equality and or sustainable development).</p>

<p>To  remind projects awaiting a Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) of the need to keep evidence of any actual delivery action taken.</p>

<p>To ask projects if they have any case studies and or examples of good practice that they could send to the Managing Authority in terms of promoting equality and or sustainable development during the current COVID-19 pandemic, so that ideas can be shared and to help the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authorities publicise how responsive <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects have been.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<h4>Equal Opportunities and Sustainable Development Implementation Plans</h4>

<p>The Cross Cutting Theme (<abbr title="Cross Cutting Theme">CCT</abbr>) implementation plans are meant to be working documents and should explain action that projects have taken to promote equality and sustainable development. We know that many projects have had to adapt and change the way they deliver their activities in light of COVID-19 and it is important that their <abbr title="Cross Cutting Theme">CCT</abbr> implementation plans include what has happened so far (since March 2020) where it has a bearing on equality or sustainable development and include any future planned action. Progression towards aims and objectives need to be fully reported on a quarterly basis at the claims stage.</p>

<h4>Evidence of delivery - <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>.</h4>

<p>There have been issues in the past with projects failing to provide evidence of delivery or action taken at the time of their <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>. This Action Note reminds projects of the importance of keeping evidence of action they have taken in terms of delivery - and this should include any recent and or new delivery arrangements responding to the pandemic which help maintain and or promote equality and sustainable development.</p>

<h4>Good practice</h4>

<p>A number of projects have noted that some of the new delivery arrangements which have had to be made because of the COVID-19 pandemic have actually helped support equality by promoting wider access to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> (for example, new online support benefitting lone parents and or people with transport issues). Similarly, new arrangements may have helped projects support sustainable development by reducing impact on the environment (for example reducing petrol consumption through lower levels of car-usage).  The Managing Authority would like to share examples of good practice across <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> partnership to demonstrate how projects are responding flexibly and still helping to promote the <abbr title="Cross Cutting Theme">CCTs</abbr> at the same time.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Action</h2>

<p>(i) Projects should review their <abbr title="Cross Cutting Theme">CCT</abbr> Implementation Plans to ensure that they are up to date and reflect any new delivery arrangements introduced (or planned for) that support equality and sustainable development where appropriate.</p>

<p>The Quarterly <abbr title="Cross Cutting Theme">CCT</abbr> Progress reports for Q1 2021 claims should briefly summarise  any changes that have been made to the <abbr title="Cross Cutting Theme">CCT</abbr> Implementation Plans (in light of COVID-19) or explain why no changes have been required.</p>

<p>(ii) Projects that have made changes to their delivery arrangements and who are currently awaiting a Project Inception Visit (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr>) should keep evidence of their new delivery arrangements to help support the <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIV</abbr> process for their project.</p>

<p>(iii)  Projects are invited to share any case studies and examples of good practice in terms of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic ( from an equality or sustainability perspective) with the Managing Authority. Please send any case studies and or examples to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:esf.2014-2020@dwp.gov.uk">esf.2014-2020@dwp.gov.uk</a>, by 28 April 2021.</p>

<h2>
