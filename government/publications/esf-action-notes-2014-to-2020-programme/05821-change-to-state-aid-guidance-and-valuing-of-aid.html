<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Who should read</h2>

<p>This Action Note goes to all Grant Recipients including <abbr title="Co-financing Organisations">CFOs</abbr>, Direct Bid Recipients and  Intermediate Bodies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>Earlier versions of the State Aid Guidance listed a set of ‘Groups not Included’  for State Aid purposes.  This arrangement is no longer available and should not be relied upon by Grant Recipients. Further detail is below.</p>

<p>In addition, the Managing Authority is setting out the requirement to ensure aid applied to the project is valued appropriately by the applicant and Grant Recipient and this is reported on in submitted claims.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<p>Previous versions of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> State Aid guidance stated that supporting the following customer groups or activities should not be regarded as state aid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for literacy and numeracy at all levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shared investment (employer and public funding) for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) at all levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for all Apprenticeships (including Advanced) delivered to 16-18 year olds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-funding for Apprenticeships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-funding for first Advanced Apprenticeships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for first Level 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for Level 3 jumpers (people who miss out level 2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for first full level 3 for 19 to 25 year olds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Previous versions of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> State Aid guidance stated that supporting the following customer groups or activities should not be regarded as state aid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for literacy and numeracy at all levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shared investment (employer and public funding) for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) at all levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for all Apprenticeships (including Advanced) delivered to 16 to 18 year olds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-funding for Apprenticeships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Co-funding for first Advanced Apprenticeships.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for first Level 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for Level 3 jumpers (people who miss out level 2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Full funding for first full level 3 for 19 to 25 year olds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These groups are no longer exempt from State Aid, so where projects are working with these types of participants or beneficiaries, the full State Aid test should be applied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Valuing of aid</h3>

<p>As part of a submitted application and ongoing delivery of the project the applicant and Grant Recipient must set out and have considered the value of aid applied to the activities within the project. There are two methods available:</p>

<p>Method 1 relates to an average of the costs if that support was bought privately. Using this method, the Grant Recipient will need to explain how they have calculated that average, for example through comparison of three other suppliers and calculating the average of the costs based on this information; or</p>

<p>Method 2 relates to their real costs (such as the hourly rate of the member of staff who is providing the support, plus the 15 or 40% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> attributed to that salary. The Grant Recipient should use the hourly rate applied to the member of staff undertaking the cost with an uplift of the appropriate <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr> for the project by the number of hours to complete the task to identify the level of aid.</p>

<p>These are the only methods available for use. No other methodology proposed by Applicants and Grant Recipients can be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Worked Examples</h3>

<h4>Method 1</h4>

<p>A Grant Recipient is providing an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with a Training Needs Analysis, and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, the Grant Recipient takes an average of the costs 3 other providers would charge the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for this activity, so, for example;</p>

<p>Joe Bloggs Training Ltd would charge £1,500 for a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> for an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with less than 50 employees, and a further £500 for a training plan, giving a total of £2,000</p>

<p>Jane Doe College Services Ltd would charge £1,350 for a <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr> and a further £700 for a bespoke training plan, so total would be £2,050</p>

<p>Training R Us Ltd would charge £1,700 for the <abbr title="Training Needs Analysis">TNA</abbr>, and include the bespoke training plan free of charge.</p>

<p>Therefore, the average of these providers would be (£2,000 + £2,050 + £1,700 = £5,750 divided by 3) £1,916.67 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If the project is using the De Minimis route, this would be the amount of De Minimis aid that they need to tell the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> that they have received. If the project is using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr>, this is the total aid amount, and they will need to seek the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> contribution to this total (under Training Aid for example, the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> must contribute 50% of these costs, so the Grant Recipient would need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for £958.34).</p>

<h4>Method 2</h4>

<p>The Applicant or Grant Recipient is providing an <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> with a Training Needs Analysis, and then developing a training plan for a group of the staff who work for the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr>, as above.</p>

<p>In this case, the Grant Recipient should take the hourly rate for the member of staff doing the Training Needs Analysis, include the Flat Rate Indirect Cost (<abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) uplift, then multiply that by the number of hours taken to carry out the Training Needs Analysis and development of the plan. For example, £27:15 per hour (including 15% <abbr title="Flat Rate Indirect Costs">FRIC</abbr>) x 43 hours = £1,167.45 worth of aid.</p>

<p>If De Minimis applies, this is the amount of De Minimis aid the Grant Recipient will need to inform the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> they have received, and if they are using the <abbr title="General Block Exemption Regulation">GBER</abbr> they will need to invoice the <abbr title="Small and medium sized enterprises">SME</abbr> for 50% of the costs (£583.73).</p>

<p>The Managing Authority have updated all relevant guidance for applicants and Grant Recipients.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Action</h2>

<p>This arrangement is no longer available. Any <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Grant Recipient operating on this basis should conduct the full State Aid assessment for these types of participant or beneficiary, and will need to conclude how any aid (if present) will be treated. If this assessment results in a conclusion that there is aid, you must notify your Contract Manager, with full details of how you will monitor and manage the aid - including your recording and reporting processes. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-state-aid"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> State Aid</a> guidance has been updated.</p>

<p>The valuing of aid is applicable to all projects and should form part of the audit retained by the applicant and Grant Recipient. The approach applies from 16 March 2021.</p>
