<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p>All&nbsp;<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Bid&nbsp;Beneficiary Organisations and the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>&nbsp;Managing Authority</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This Action Note is to notify Direct Bid Grant Recipients of additional funding available, the criteria and process to apply.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In Action Note 063/21, we invited existing <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects who met specific criteria to submit Project Change Requests (<abbr title="Project Change Requests">PCRs</abbr>) to seek an extension and additional funding for projects to continue until the end of December 2023.</p>

<p>There is now additional funding available for existing <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Bid projects who meet the criteria set out in this Action Note. <abbr title="Co-financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> Projects are not eligible to apply. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Beneficiaries within the Greater London Authority are not eligible to apply for funding through this process at this time.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> is focussed on committing all the funding we have received from the European Commission. It is imperative that if your project applies for additional funding, that you are able to spend this to deliver the outcomes you commit to in the PCR.</p>

<p>You should be aware that failure to achieve the revised expenditure or deliverables targets could mean that action is taken under our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-performance-of-projects/underperformance-policy">underperformance policy</a>, this could mean a performance penalty is applied which could include withdrawal of funding or claw back.</p>

<h3>Scope of the extensions approach and project criteria</h3>

<p>This process applies where projects are seeking additional funding. If you are seeking a time-only extension, you should engage with your Contract Manager as normal.</p>

<p>All extension requests will be limited to no more than 50% increase against the total value of the Project’s Funding Agreement.</p>

<p>If the value of the project has increased since the original funding agreement (i.e. as a result of an application to an open call) the increase you can request will be limited to 50% of the revised value.</p>

<p>If a project has already received an increase up to 50% as a result of a PCR-submitted funding increase (for example against Action Note 063/21), it will not be eligible for additional funding.</p>

<p>All projects need to have financially completed (have a proposed Financial Completion Date and all project costs defrayed) no later than 31 December 2023.</p>

<p>Project extensions must be focussed on the same type of provision, and to the same target group as the existing project. Extension requests must ensure there are no substantial changes to the scope of the revised project.</p>

<p>In order for an application for additional funding to be considered, projects must meet the following criteria:</p>

<h3>Projects must:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>be up and running, with at least 6 months of delivery activity completed (and have signed and returned their Funding Agreement (<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>) and any outstanding variations)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be up to date with their claims – with all claims up to the previous quarter having been submitted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be up to date against their profile of expenditure – as agreed in their&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be up to date against their profile of outputs – as agreed in their&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Criteria numbers 3 and 4 will allow for tolerance against the profile in the project&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>&nbsp;as follows:</p>

<h3>Projects with a&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>&nbsp;signed pre-April 2019</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>projects will need to have achieved at least 80% of the contracted expenditure profile and 50% outputs profile up to and including Quarter 1 2020 (pre-COVID-19); and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at least 50% of expenditure profile and 20% outputs profile for the Quarter 2 2020 to Quarter 1 2022 period in recognition of the impact COVID-19 may have had on project delivery</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Projects with a&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>&nbsp;signed between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>projects will need to have achieved at least 50% of contracted expenditure and outputs profiles up to and including Quarter 1 2020 (pre COVID-19); and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at least 50% of expenditure profile and 20% outputs profile for the Quarter 2 2020 to Quarter 1 2022 period. These requirements recognise the impact of project start-up activity during the first months following issue of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>&nbsp;and are in recognition of the impact COVID-19 may have had on project delivery</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Projects with a&nbsp;<abbr title="Funding Agreement">FA</abbr>&nbsp;signed from 1 April 2020 onwards</h3>

<p>In recognition of these projects having entered into FAs with the Managing Authority since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, projects are required to have achieved at least 50% of expenditure profile and 20% of outputs profile for the Quarter 2 2020 to Quarter 1 2022.</p>

<h3>Applying for Funding</h3>

<p>If you think your project is eligible to apply for further funding, please request a PCR self-assessment checklist via the central inbox. Please use the following naming convention - Name of project, EClaims reference number, the quarter and the year the project ends. e.g. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> MA project_22S23P0207_Q2_2022.</p>

<p>On receipt from your <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr>, please complete the checklist and if you are eligible, send it to the central inbox using the correct subject heading naming convention - Name of project, EClaims reference number, the quarter and the year the project ends. e.g. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> MA project_22S23P0207_Q2_2022</p>

<p>Central Inbox - <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:esf.pcr2checklistsubmissions@dwp.gov.uk">esf.pcr2checklistsubmissions@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Contract Manager">CM</abbr> will review your project’s performance and, if your project is eligible, they will invite you to submit your PCR on ECLAIMS by 31 December 2022.</p>
