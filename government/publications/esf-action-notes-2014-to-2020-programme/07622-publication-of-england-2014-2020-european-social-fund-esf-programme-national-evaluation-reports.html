<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme stakeholders including: Grant Recipients, Co-Financing Organisations, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority, Greater London Authority, Intermediate Bodies, Local Enterprise Partnership areas, Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) projects.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This Action Note informs <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme stakeholders about the publication of three research reports from the national evaluation of the England 2014-2020 Programme. The reports include findings from the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> participant leavers survey, qualitative research at case study sites and a full impact evaluation of the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>. They have been published as part of the Department for Work and Pensions research series.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The three evaluations of the national <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 programme published on 2nd March 2022 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-and-youth-employment-initiative-leavers-survey-report-2016-2019">European Social Fund and Youth Employment Initiative Leavers Survey Report 2016-2019</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-the-european-social-fund-2014-2020-programme-in-england-qualitative-case-study-research">Evaluation of the European Social Fund 2014-2020 Programme in England: Qualitative case study research</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-employment-initiative-impact-evaluation">Youth Employment Initiative – Impact Evaluation</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These evaluation reports represent a substantive body of evidence about the effectiveness, impact, and value for money of the first half of the 2014-2020 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme, including the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Research was conducted over a 4-year period from 2016 to the end of 2019 and used a range of methods including data analysis, participant surveys, in-depth interviews and focus groups with staff and participants from projects across the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Investment Priorities. The <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> report also includes impact analysis and cost-benefit analysis to quantify the additional benefit and value that the <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> provided compared with a counterfactual (such as, what benefits would have been realised over and above a world without <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>).</p>

<p>It should be noted that the research for all three evaluation reports was completed just before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and so the results do not reflect subsequent effects on the management and delivery of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme and the labour market more generally.</p>

<h2>Key findings</h2>

<p>Overall, the evidence strongly suggests that the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme has been effective so far in meeting its objectives to support people to move closer to, or into work, or to be sustained or progress in-work, through its focus on employment, skills and social inclusion measures.</p>

<p>Projects felt that the programme has been highly effective in its outreach activities to identify and engage with participants, many of whom face additional disadvantages. On the whole, programme design and delivery was perceived as working well, driven by effective local partnership working and continuity from previous programmes, though some projects felt that eligibility and evidence requirements adversely impacted on delivery.</p>

<p>Looking at programme outcomes, survey evidence shows that more than half (53 per cent) of individuals were in employment six months after leaving the programme compared with less than three in ten (29 per cent) at entry. Of those in work on joining <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, three in ten (31 per cent) had experienced an improvement in their situation.</p>

<p>Improvements in soft skills such as confidence, motivation and communication skills as a result of receiving <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> provision were widely reported, and participation appears to have greatly increased participants’ optimism about finding employment.</p>

<p>One of the key reasons for the effectiveness of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> has been identified as the provision of personalised wrap-around support delivered through a keyworker that enables participants to address barriers that are preventing them from working. Features such as flexibility of provision, having a consistent point of contact and time to build relationships were cited as key differences between <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded programmes and other support that participants may have experienced.</p>

<h2>Youth Employment Initiative specific findings</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> appeared to be particularly effective with more than 44 per cent of participants who were not in education, employment or training on joining <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, in employment six months after leaving and a further 16 per cent in education or training. The analysis also shows that when compared with a similarly matched group of young people not on <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>, participants were on average in employment for an additional 56 days in the twelve months following support. This represents a moderate but positive social return on investment of between £1.50 and 1.55 per £1 spent, though this is likely to be a minimum estimate, with the true value being higher if outcomes are tracked over a longer period.</p>

<h2>Future evaluation</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Evaluation Team will continue to gather evidence from the second half of the England <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 Programme to assess its overall impact.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>The Evaluation Team would like to thank the projects, participants and Managing Authority staff who took part in the research; and the staff and teams at IFF Research and Ecorys who conducted the research.</p>
