<h2>Who should read</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Bid Technical Assistance Grant Recipients, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority Contract Managers</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This action note is to notify <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Technical Assistance Project Grant Recipients of a new Flat Rate Simplified Cost Option to be used from Q1 2020 onwards, the action to be taken by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Technical Assistance Projects to switch to the new methodology and the subsequent, new process for submitting claims under the new approach. The guidance provided below is supplementary to the Claims Guidance for Grant Recipients published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) will be using a flat rate cost methodology in order to pay Technical Assistance projects with effect from Q1 2020.</p>

<p>All Technical Assistance Projects are required to submit a Project Change Request (<abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr>) to change to the new Flat Rate Simplified Cost Option. If you have not already done so, Technical Assistance Grant Recipients should now contact their Contract Manager to discuss the requirements before submitting the <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please note, you cannot submit your Technical Assistance Claims for Q1 2020 onward until your <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> has been approved.</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Project Change Request">PCR</abbr> has been approved and you have submitted your Q1 2020 claim under the new approach, we will then work to process your claim in the relevant timescales set out in our main <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Claims Guidance.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p><strong>1.  Claims Process</strong></p>

<p>The following information replaces section ‘5.0 Transactions List’ of the ‘Claims Guidance for Grant Recipients’ for Technical Assistance project claims from Q1-20.</p>

<p><strong>Claims Cycle</strong></p>

<p>All <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Technical Assistance">TA</abbr> Projects will remain on the same quarterly claims cycle.</p>

<p>A transaction list must be uploaded directly into ECLAIMS to support each Claim. It is important that information is entered accurately.</p>

<p>The Transaction List spread sheet contains three tabs entitled ‘Guidance’, ‘Transactions’ and ‘Summary’. The Transaction List is designed to enable upload to ECLAIMS.</p>

<p>If at any time you are unsure of the level of detail required after checking with guidance, please check with your Contract Manager before uploading.</p>

<p><strong>Start Setup</strong></p>

<p>When completing the initial actions to set-up the Transaction List, all Technical Assistance projects must select the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Funds - Select ‘European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>)’</li>
  <li>Priority Axis – select ‘P3 Technical Assistance’</li>
  <li>Investment Priority – select ‘3.1 – Technical Assistance’</li>
  <li>Category of Region – select the Category of Region(s) appropriate to your project</li>
  <li>Cost Categories – select ‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Technical Assistance">TA</abbr> Flat Rate Costs’ as the sole cost category</li>
  <li>Other Settings – Do not select any of the options (Procured Contracts, Delivery Partners, Flat Rate Indirect Costs, and Irrecoverable VAT)</li>
  <li>Select Finish</li>
</ul>

<p>The details required when completing the Transaction List screen in ECLAIMS are explained below along with descriptions on whether these are mandatory fields, and what they are validated against.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>a) The fields labelled as mandatory below are those which will automatically be validated by ECLAIMS and if they are not completed accurately, the Claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>b) For data collection purposes all fields must be completed where possible regardless of whether they are labelled as mandatory or not.</p>

<p>c) All monetary figures must be to 2 decimal places; .005 and above, rounded to .01; .004 and below, rounded to .00</p>

<p>d) Dates should be added in with slashes (eg DD/MM/YYYY) as ECLAIMS will not accept full-stops - and will automatically change to YYYY-MM-DD when the ‘Export’ button is pressed.</p>

<p>e) Once the Transaction List has been completed the ‘Export’ button will need to be pressed prior to submission to ECLAIMS. This button creates a spreadsheet which is in a format that ECLAIMS can accept i.e. without macros or any other formatting.</p>

<p>For instructions on uploading the Transaction List please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustment"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> E-CLAIMS External Users Guidance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Transactions Tab</strong></p>

<p>When completing the Transactions Tab, all Technical Assistance projects must complete just one, single line of expenditure, completing the relevant columns as per the table below:</p>

<p>The following information replaces section ‘12.0 Desk-Based Evidence Check’ of the ‘Claims Guidance for Grant Recipients’ for Technical Assistance project claims from Q1-20.
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Technical Assistance">TA</abbr> Projects will still be subject to Desk-Based Administrative Checks to ensure they have submitted correct, accurate and robust claims documents.
However, for any financial claims submitted and paid via the new <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Technical Assistance">TA</abbr> Flat Rate Costs methodology, there will be no requirement for defrayal checks on the associated transaction lines at the claims stage.</p>

<p><strong>2. Verification Process (A125 On The Spot Visits)</strong></p>

<p>Verification will continue to use the existing Verification OTSV checklist. However, the Verification Team will no longer require to see evidence of defrayal directly relating to the single “<abbr title="Technical Assistance">TA</abbr> Flat Rate Costs” cost category of expenditure during the visit.</p>

<p>All other <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> regulatory requirements will continue to be checked at the visit. For example;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anti-Fraud Measures</li>
  <li>Publicity and Communications</li>
  <li>Cross-Cutting Themes etc.</li>
</ul>
