<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose</h2>

<p>This Action Note sets out the policy position regarding the interaction between the Restart Scheme and the England European Social Fund 2014 to 2020 Programme. It sets out the position agreed between the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Restart Scheme Project and Contract Management and Partner Delivery teams, and the England <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority, in respect of individuals on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support accessing Restart provision. It also sets out how Restart participants might be eligible to also receive <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded support, however it should be noted this arrangement does not apply to individuals receiving support through <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Co-financing Organisation (<abbr title="Co-financing Organisation">CFO</abbr>) <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> provision as participation on two <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> funded provisions at the same time cannot be supported. This note also clarifies the responsibility of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project in ensuring compliance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background</h2>

<p>The Restart Scheme provides up to 12 months of tailored support for each participant aiming to help them into sustained work. This could include work search skills, personalised training, identifying suitable job sectors, and developing sector specific skills and qualifications. Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches identify claimants who are both eligible and suitable for the Restart Scheme as the next step of their journey towards employment. Providers work with employers, local government, and other partners to deliver tailored support for individuals.  Early access can be considered on a case by case basis where conversations with a Work Coach suggest this is the most appropriate route for the individual.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Individuals moving from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded provision to Restart provision</h3>

<p>Before considering a referral to Restart, Work Coaches consider whether the individual is currently engaging with non-<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision, including <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded provision. Individuals who are already engaging with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded provision which is meeting their support needs, should continue to engage with this. If the provision cannot be continued alongside the Restart Scheme, then they should not be referred to the Restart Scheme.</p>

<p>The Restart Scheme may be considered when their current <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded support has ended, or the claimant is no longer engaging with it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>How <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded support can be used to provide additional support to Restart participants</h3>

<p>This note confirms that individuals receiving Restart support can also receive <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded support where the individual has support needs which are above and beyond those that will be addressed by Restart. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded support cannot replicate the support provided by the Restart provider. As set out above, it should be noted this does not apply to individuals receiving support through <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Co-financing Organisation">CFO</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> provision.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority recognises that individualsâ needs are wide and varied and some may need more intensive support than others. For these individuals, whose support needs have been identified as being above and beyond the support provided by Restart, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded provision can be used to fund that additional support as part of the overall package of support provided to the individual.</p>

<p>It must be clear what these additional needs are and there must be no duplication of the support provided in meeting the employability support grant condition.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Action</h2>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Grant Recipients are asked to note that this Action Note confirms <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded provision can be used to fund additional wraparound support for Restart participants as part of the overall package of support provided to the individual where the circumstances meet the purpose and intent of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014 to 2020 Operational Programme.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funding must only be used to deliver support in addition to what is provided by the Restart provider. It cannot be used to duplicate what is already being provided or replace planned support.</p>

<p>The additional <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support package must be agreed between the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project and the Restart provider and documented. The document must set out clearly the specific support needs that will be addressed by the Restart provider and the support needs that will be addressed through <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> provision. The document must demonstrate that those support needs are in addition to those addressed by Restart.</p>

<p>It is for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project to demonstrate that the support they deliver to Restart participants is in direct response to support needs which are over and above those being addressed by the Restart provider.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project is responsible for ensuring only eligible expenditure directly associated with the additional wraparound support is included in claims to the Managing Authority. Failure to do this could result in the grant recipient being required to re-pay the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> grant attributable to that person.</p>

<p>All documentation must be retained by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project for verification and audit purposes.</p>
