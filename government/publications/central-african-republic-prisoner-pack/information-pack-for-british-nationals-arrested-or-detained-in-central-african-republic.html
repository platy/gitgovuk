<span class="number">1. </span>Chapter 1: Key points</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you. However, we cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer. Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This information pack aims to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Central African Republic and who can help. Consular staff can provide a printed copy to those in prison or in custody. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h4>Contacting us</h4>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British embassy, high commission or consulate (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself. You should do this if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British embassy, high commission or consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British embassy, high commission or consulate even if you do not want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h4>Who we are</h4>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in the UK, and in British embassies, high commissions and consulates overseas.</p>

<pre><code>  The British Embassy in Kinshasa:

  British Embassy

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.</p>

<h4>What we can do</h4>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. When we are notified of your arrest or detention, we will aim to contact you as soon as possible, so that we can assess how we can help you. We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions. Our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Central African Republic, notification by the authorities to the consulate normally takes place within 24 hours, sometime it can take several days after arrest. Since there is no British Embassy in CAR, this may take longer than 24hours.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>We can also:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list of local English-speaking lawyers and interpreters . See also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-list-of-lawyers" rel="external">https://https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-list-of-lawyers</a> , <a class="govuk-link" href="https://https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-list-of-translators-and-interpreters" rel="external">https:/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-list-of-translators-and-interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>

</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services are not available we can also try to pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you)</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK</li>
</ul>

<h4>What we cannot do</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>Help you get special treatment because you are British</li>
  <li>Offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>Pay for any costs because you have been arrested</li>
  <li>Forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>Prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>First steps</h3>

<h4>Informing family members</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and provide them with information about how to contact you. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider what the impact of not doing so might be. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Informing the UK police</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. Information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances when information about you may need to be shared with authorities in Central African Republic.</p>

<h4>Legal assistance: lawyers</h4>

<p>We cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime. However, we can provide information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can also give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers . You should consider the benefits of local legal representation and discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. We cannot pay your legal or interpretation costs in any circumstance.</p>

<h4>Consular assistance: fair treatment</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, or get you special treatment because you are British. If you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards, we will consider whether to approach the local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>Other organisations that can provide assistance</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in Central African Republic</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Who can visit and how to arrange visits</h4>

<p>Each prison has set visiting times. All prisoners are entitled to social (family / friends) or official (lawyers/ Consular officials) visits during set times. In extreme cases, the prosecution attorney may seek to limit visits if they consider this may be detrimental to the case.</p>

<p>Everyone has to comply with the date and times set out in prison regulations. Mostly visiting times are advertised outside the prisons and visitors should go directly to the prison to visit. In certain circumstances Consular officers may accompany your family during their first visit to the prison; the subsequent visits by your family will be unaccompanied. You need to show an ID before accessing to the prison being granted.</p>

<p>In the majority of the prisons, you are allowed to receive visitors every day. Some prisons only allow visits on certain days of the week. Friends and family should check with the prison officials directly about when visits are allowed, or ask the British Embassy Consular team for advice.</p>

<h4>What to expect when you visit</h4>

<p>Generally visitors will meet the prison at parlour, where they sit side by side. An ID is needed before accessing in the Prison premises.</p>

<h4>What you can take on your visit</h4>

<p>CAR has a large number of prison facilities and regulations about permitted items vary from one prison to another. The rules can change frequently and at short notice. Families should contact the prison authorities directly for advice on what they can and cannot bring.</p>

<h4>Visits: consular staff</h4>

<p>We will try to visit you at least every three months and more frequently if we have any concerns about the conditions in which you are being held. During our routine visits you will have the opportunity to discuss any health issues, security concerns, your treatment in prison and any other general issues that you wish to raise with our Consular staff. If there is any information that you would prefer us not to disclose to your Next of Kin you should let us know during these visits.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Kinshasa.Consular@fcdo.gov">Kinshasa.Consular@fcdo.gov</a>  â but if it is urgent it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf).</p>

<h4>Emergency trips outside of prison</h4>

<p>Generally this is not allowed in the Central African Republic.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>Arriving at the police station: your basic rights</h4>

<p>When someone is arrested they may be briefly held at a police station or other facility before being transferred to prison. Any belongings that are not part of the investigation, process, or evidence should be given to the family; the court will keep them if you have no family. It is unfortunately not unusual for some belongings to go missing right after arrest or during prisoner transfers. They may allow you make a phone call but on your own expenses. They do not provide translator for you, you have to one for yourself.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot store your personal belongings on your behalf, apart from your passport and driverâs licence. However, these items are usually retained by the courts until the end of your sentence, although we will sometimes formally request for them to be returned to the British Embassy. Please note that your passport might be kept by the courts as evidence of the alleged crime or as a condition for your bail/parole to prevent you from skipping bail.</p>

<h4>Appearing at court</h4>

<p>We the person appear at court, he will provide an interpreter own his own expenses. Local authority would not provider interpreter, like wise for the lawyer.</p>

<p>More information about the CAR judicial system can be found in Chapter 3.</p>

<h4>Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>When someone is arrested they may be briefly held at a police station or other facility before being transferred to prison. Any belongings that are not part of the investigation, process, or evidence should be given to the family; the court will keep them if you have no family. It is unfortunately not unusual for some belongings to go missing right after arrest or during prisoner transfers.</p>

<p>It happens that someone can be held for long without being trialled.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>Prison conditions in the CAR can be very challenging. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are a major problem in all prisons and detention centres. Bottled drinking water is rarely available although tap water is usually provided. Food provided by the prison is usually very poor quality and sometimes only one meal a deal is provided. For this reason, families often bring additional food and water to the prisons for their loved ones, or send money to enable prisoners to buy additional items themselves. Shower facilities are sometimes available but frequent power cuts mean that hot water is scarce. Mosquitoes, cockroaches and rats are commonplace. The prison authorities will only provide very basic items in prison such as prison uniforms and a bed.</p>

<p>As a result of these challenging conditions British Embassy Consular officials will usually, with your permission, seek to contact friends and family at an early stage to explore what additional support arrangements can be made for prisoners. The British Embassy is unable to provide this support itself, although we will do what we can to support families get suitable arrangements in place, particularly if there are no family members in CAR. Some options include working with local hotels or other organisations to arrange deliveries of food, toiletries and other basic items.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>All prisoners are held together and they share same common cells. Cells are overcrowded. Sometimes one need to pay in order to get in cell and to sleep on a bed. If you do not have money you may sleep on the floor and sometime in the corridor. Cells are not big, there are also VIP rooms, and prisoner needs to pay more to get a single room. Usually it is occupied by politicians who are held in prison.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>Prisons in CAR are extremely underfunded and are not always able to supply prisoners with adequate food and water. Bottled drinking water is rarely available although tap water is usually provided. Food provided by the prison is usually very poor quality and sometimes only one meal a deal is provided. There is an expectation that a prisonerâs family and friends will provide his/her food. In some prisons, areas are available for prisoners to grow their own food.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Prisoners have access to a common shower room, each one can bath once day.</p>

<h5>Work and study</h5>

<p>CAR Penal Code states that work is compulsory for prisoners, but that prisoners cannot be compelled to work if there is a good reason (normally health-related) why they cannot. Work in prisons normally consists of gardening, farming, joinery, soap factories and other activities aimed at social reintegration.</p>

<p>Studying or Learning and development opportunities are not available in CAR prisons. If you decide to undergo distance learning, a request should be addressed to the attorney general for authorisation.</p>

<h4>Contact and languages</h4>

<p>Prisoners can interact with others without any restriction. Letters are subject to censorship. Any ingoing or outgoing letter will be submitted to the director of the prison to assess its content. Some prisons will accept parcels (including foodstuffs) but the prison guard too will check these. Occasionally prisons will only permit reading materials in French (as they do not have the capability to check reading materials in English).</p>

<p>There are no telephone facilities in CAR prisons. However, arrangements can sometimes be made with the prison authorities to have a mobile phone available for your use. This should be purchased by you and will be kept by the authorities and handed to you only if you want to make a phone call. Again this arrangement is only made on request and can be refused.</p>

<p>There is the possibility to request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries). You can request local language materials through the post from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> (including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>CAR prisons do not normally have leisure facilities beyond a yard for exercising.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>

<p>The climate is very different to that of the UK. It can be very hot and humid during rainy season (September-May) and cool during dry season (June-August). Prisons in CAR do not provide any kind of clothes.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>Prisoners are free to take part in religious services of their choice. Every prisons have chaplains from different religions.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>Drug trafficking between inmates in prisons is widespread. If you are caught with any kind of illegal drugs, you will be punished accordingly. Infectious diseases are very common in prisons.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>Receiving money</h4>

<p>There are 2 ways you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends.</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>: depending on where you are detained, if your family cannot support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).</li>
</ul>

<p>Money received from the UK will be converted into local currency and held on your behalf by our Embassy. Our Consular staff will then transfer your funds to you during our routine consular visits.</p>

<p>There is no prison account facility available in CAR but sometimes it will be possible to make an arrangement with prison officials so that they can keep the money for you. Some prisons in CAR have rules about the amount of money you can have in the prison at any one times, and require the money to be held in Congolese francs (rather than dollars). Embassy staff will need to adhere to any prison rules regarding money. Any remaining funds will be kept at the Embassy and sent to you later on. Please note that our Consular staff cannot be responsible for the loss of funds by the Prison Authorities.</p>

<p>Please note that the Embassy does not provide financial support to British Nationals in prison abroad; we can only help get money to you that has been sent by friends, family or a charity.</p>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family or friends.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a âPrison Comfortâ system for money transfers to prisoners. Ask your family or friends to get in touch with the FCDO to arrange this.</p>

<p>We cannot receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not receiving regular donations from other sources.</p>

<h4>Medical and Dental treatment</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, CAR is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.</p>

<p>The prison Medical Officer is responsible for prisonersâ health care. However, lack of funding means that equipment, drugs and qualified staff are in short supply in most prisons. In most cases, prisoners rely on friends or relatives to purchase prescribed medication. Prisoners with serious health concerns are sent to local public or private hospitals. In some cases prisoners will be asked to cover the cost of any external (outside the prison) medical treatment. The British Embassy is unable to pay any medical bills for prisoners. With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also contact your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records.</p>

<h4>Letters and parcels</h4>

<p>Letters are subject to censorship. Any ingoing or outgoing letter will be submitted to the director of the prison to assess its content. Some prisons will accept parcels (including foodstuffs) but the prison guard too will check these. Occasionally prisons will only permit reading materials in French (as they do not have the capability to check reading materials in English).</p>

<p>There are no telephone facilities in CAR prisons. However, arrangements can sometimes be made with the prison authorities to have a mobile phone available for your use. This should be purchased by you and will be kept by the authorities and handed to you only if you want to make a phone call. Again this arrangement is only made on request and can be refused.</p>

<h4>Making a complaint about mistreatment</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, you should inform consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and explain any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible take photos of your injuries.</p>

<p>There is no official common complaints procedure in place for mistreatment in the CAR. With your permission, we can consider taking up a complaint about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination with the police or prison authorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Chapter 3: The Central African Republic judicial system</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>The independence of the judicial system of the CAR is enshrined in the constitution. However, the CAR system faces many challenges to ensure its independence. Magistrates and judges are often underpaid and the corruption and politicisation of the judiciary is a big issue.</p>

<p>There are four different types of court in the CAR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peace Court: Deals with civil cases;</li>
  <li>Crown Court: Deals with criminal cases;</li>
  <li>Court of Appeal: Will rule on sentences pronounced in both the Peace and Crown Court;</li>
  <li>Cassation Court: Will rule on sentences pronounced in the Court of Appeal;</li>
  <li>Constitutional Court: Deals with all that is link to the CAR constitution.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>First steps</h3>

<h4>What should happen after you are arrested</h4>

<p>Articles 4, 6 and 15 of the CAR criminal procedure code lay out the procedure for arrest. The Director of Public Prosecution has the power to summon or subpoena anyone accused of a crime. However, an arrest warrant is not necessary for all crimes. For instance, if a crime is âpunishable by at least six months imprisonment, when there is a fear that the accused may abscond or when his/her identity is unknownâ the Police also have the power of arrest without a warrant.</p>

<p>In cases where the crime is punishable by at least three months imprisonment, any citizen can, in absence of judicial authority, make an arrest.</p>

<p>If you have any questions on the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. See for CAR list of English speaking lawyers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-list-of-lawyers" rel="external">https://https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/central-african-republic-list-of-lawyers</a></p>

<h4>How long you can be remanded in custody</h4>

<p>Under the CAR constitution, a person cannot be held in custody for longer than 48 hours without being charged. After this time, the arrested party must either be released or charged. An exception is in cases of national security when the arrested party can be held indefinitely but an extension to their detention must be granted and regularly reviewed by a court.</p>

<p>Prisoners on remand and sentenced prisoners: differences</p>

<p>Under the CAR constitution, a person cannot be held in custody for longer than 48 hours without being charged. After this time, the arrested party must either be released or charged. An exception is in cases of national security when the arrested party can be held indefinitely but an extension to their detention must be granted and regularly reviewed by a court.</p>

<p>After you are charged</p>

<p>There is no set length of time between being charged and coming to trial. Following an arrest, the arrested person must be brought before a court within 5 days. The court will then make a ruling on detention (remaining in custody, released on bail or released with no further charges). If the court rules that the arrested party must remain in custody, they can be held âunder prevention detentionâ for a further 15 days. After this time, an extension must be sought from the court every month until the investigation is complete.</p>

<p>An exception to this is for the crime of sexual violence. Under article 1 of the Bill on Sexual Violence, the investigation into any allegation of sexual violence must be complete within one month and the trial must be complete within 3 months.</p>

<p>Bail</p>

<p>Article 32 of the Criminal Code states that bail can be granted in all cases. However, we sometimes see cases, such as crimes against national security, where this option does not appear to be available. The power to grant bail lies with the judge appointed to the case.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot transfer bail funds.</p>

<span class="number">3.3 </span>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>Legal assistance: lawyers and legal aid</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer, see for a list of English-speaking lawyers . <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>Arrested persons are entitled to legal representation from the time of their arrest and allowed access to their legal representation whilst in custody, subject to prison rules.</p>

<p>The criminal code does state that legal aid is available in the CAR. In reality, representations by a legal aid lawyer are extremely limited. You should strongly consider hiring a lawyer if you have been arrested in the CAR.</p>

<p>The attached list of lawyers is provided by the British Embassy for your convenience, but neither Her Majestyâs Government, nor any official of the Consulate, take any responsibility for the competence or probity of any firm/advocate on the list or for the consequence of any legal action initiated or advice given.</p>

<h4>Trial</h4>

<p>At the trial the prosecution makes its case. If at the close of the prosecution the court decides that there is no case against the accused, the case is dismissed. If the court decides that the accused has a case to answer, then the case for defence is heard. At the close of the hearing, both the public prosecutor and the defence summarise their case. The judge then delivers his verdict. The sentence must be passed within 48 hours of the verdict.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>Sentences vary greatly in CAR and will depend on the seriousness of the crime and whether it is a State or Federal crime. Your lawyer/public defender will be best placed to advise on length of sentences and on appeals processes.</p>

<h4>Appeals</h4>

<p>Appeals from the Peace and Crown Courts lie in the Court of Appeal. Appeals from the Court of Appeal lie in the Cassation Court.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>Reduction of sentence (remission)</h4>

<p>There is some provision for a reduction of sentence. In these cases, applications are on the basis of good behaviour.</p>

<h4>Early release</h4>

<p>There is a possibility to be released from prison before the initial release date, especially in the case of terminal illness. But this is extremely rare.</p>

<h4>Clemency or pardon</h4>

<p>There is provision for a Presidential pardon in the Constitution, Article 87</p>

<p>Pardons are extremely rare. Once a judgement has been pronounced, without possibility for further appeal, the President becomes the only institution able to grant a pardon (clemency or early release). The process is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The accused applies for a pardon;</li>
  <li>An investigation involving the public prosecutor, the judges and the Attorney General as well as the penitential authorities is conducted;</li>
  <li>The case is escalated to the Ministry of Justice;</li>
  <li>The case is escalated to the office of the President;</li>
  <li>The president signs a decree to grant the pardon in the event of a successful application;</li>
  <li>The penitential authorities implement the decree The accused applies for a pardon;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Financial penalties</h4>

<p>These can occur and are decided by the Court.</p>

<h4>Transfer to another prison within Central</h4>

<p>If you have been tried and convicted you will be sent to a prison where you can expect to serve your sentence. Transfers are only permitted when there are exceptional and compassionate reasons for doing so.</p>

<h4>Transfer to a prison in the UK</h4>

<p>There is no prison transfer arrangement between the CAR and the UK.</p>

<p>To find out more about transfers to the UK:</p>

<h4>Release and deportation</h4>

<p>The expulsion process is a compulsory administrative process that is carried out against all foreigners that commit a crime in CAR. This means they will usually be deported on completion of their sentence.</p>

<p>Any prisoners released who have an expulsion order issued against them will be transferred from the prison to the CAR immigration office to complete the relevant administration process. If the expulsion decree is issued and signed, the person will be expected to organise and pay for a flight out of CAR themselves; the CAR Government will not pay for this flight. He or she should discuss this with the prison authorities/with a consular officer. The person will be escorted by the police to the airport and usually onto the plane.</p>

<p>If a prisoner is released and they donât have an expulsion order issued against them, they can leave the country at any time at their own expense.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. You may not have lived in the UK before and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance you should tell your consular caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroadâs Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<h4>Your criminal record in the UK</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if youâre arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>
