<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Regulated activity with children</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Acting as a childminder on domestic premises (the English definition relates to providing childminding services that need registration with a regulatory body)</li>
  <li>Providing day-care (the English definition is as above)</li>
  <li>Carrying out the function of a guardian ad litem/children’s court guardian</li>
  <li>Carrying out the function of a controller appointed in respect of a child under Article 101 of the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986</li>
</ul>

<p>The following positions are in regulated activity with children only if the job holder has the opportunity, because of the role held, to have contact with the children:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carrying out inspection functions of child minding and day care for children under the age of 12</li>
  <li>An education inspector who inspects:
a) schools
b) further education institutions
c) colleges
d) grant-aided institutions or establishments
e) institutions or establishments which are established, maintained or managed by the Education Authority
f) Carrying out the functions of the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland
g) Carrying out the functions of the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) (inspections of health and social care services and other roles)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Establishments in Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>If someone does not meet regulated activity because of what they do, they may meet it because of where they work. This will be mainly, but not exclusively, for ancillary roles, such as cleaners, administrative staff etc.</p>

<p>The list of establishments and other criteria that must be met is the same as the Regulated Activity with Children in England <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-guidance-leaflets">leaflet</a>, however it also applies to the following establishments in Northern Ireland:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Children’s hospitals</li>
  <li>Premises which are used for the provision of education by the Education Authority or on its behalf (this is in addition to educational institutions exclusively or mainly for the provision or full-time education of children)</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about regulated activity with children in Northern Ireland can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/regulated-activity-relation-children" rel="external">Northern Ireland Department of Health guidance around regulated activity with children</a>.</p>
