<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: 2022 to 2023 high needs place change notification process</h2>

<p>The high needs place change notification process for 2022 to 2023 is now open. Schools and colleges should engage in discussions with local authorities about their high needs places for academic year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>We have published guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance" class="govuk-link">high needs place change process</a>.</p>

<p>We have also published the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance" class="govuk-link">spring 2021 census data</a> for high needs pupil numbers in special academies and free schools, and the place numbers for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. You can use this to inform local discussion about commissioning arrangements for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: autumn school census 2021, Thursday 7 October 2021</h2>

<p>All non-maintained special schools, academies, free schools and city technology colleges should be reminded that the schools census is due to take place shortly.</p>

<p>The census date for the 2021 autumn school census is Thursday, 7 October, with the deadline for approved submissions being Wednesday, 3 November. The database will be closed to amendments on Wednesday, 1 December.</p>

<p>A guide for the 2021 to 2022 academic year is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complete-the-school-census" class="govuk-link">now available</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: guide to academy trust severance payments</h2>

<p>We have updated the guidance for trusts considering making <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-severance-payments-form?utm_source=6+October+2021&amp;utm_medium=ESFA+Update&amp;utm_campaign=ESFA">special severance payments</a> with additional requirements following publication of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-exit-payments-guidance-on-special-severance-payments" class="govuk-link">HM Treasury Guidance on Public Sector Exit Payments</a> in June 2021.</p>

<p>The Academy Trust Handbook 2021 reflects this change in paragraph 5.12 that trusts must obtain prior ESFA approval before making a staff severance payment where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an exit package which includes a special severance payment is at, or above, £100,000; and/or</li>
  <li>the employee earns over £150,000</li>
</ul>

<p>This is additional to the existing requirements for approval of severance payments of £50k or more.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Reminder: changes to the business rates payment process</h2>

<p>We’ve published the government response following our consultation on centralising the payment of business rates. This confirms that, from 1 April 2022, ESFA will pay business rates directly to billing authorities on behalf of schools for 5 to 16-year-olds.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022, academies will not be able to submit rates claims via the NNDR portal to recoup their rates, and this academy upload function will be removed. Instead, all billing amounts (including any adjustments) will be uploaded by billing authorities.</p>

<p>Academies do not need to make payments to billing authorities in respect to their 2022 to 2023 rates bill.</p>

<p>Academies will remain accountable for making payments to billing authorities for any outstanding rates bills in relation to 2021 to 2022 or earlier years.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-the-payment-process-of-schools-business-rates" class="govuk-link">consultation response</a> contains further details on the changes, and how centralisation of payments will be implemented.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Reminder: call for academies to submit historic claims for unclaimed years</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2022 academies will not be able to submit historic claims for previously unclaimed years. Academies have until the end of March 2022 to submit any outstanding historic claims relating to the 2015 to 2016 financial year onwards via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-claims" class="govuk-link">NNDR portal</a>.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022, ESFA will no longer accept, process, or reimburse academies for historic claims relating to unclaimed years. This applies to years from 2015 to 2016 up until 2021 to 2022 which have not already been claimed for.</p>

<p>Academies will continue to be able to claim for historic adjustments to claims made from 1 April 2017 onwards through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-claims" class="govuk-link">NNDR portal</a> after April 2022.</p>

<p>We’d encourage academies to submit any historic NNDR claims for unclaimed years at their earliest convenience, so that department can meet such claims promptly.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Reminder: call for academies to register multi-use sites</h2>

<p>ESFA will cover any additional rates costs associated with additional buildings on a school site which are used to deliver education for pupils at the school (for example, a sports hall that is used by pupils during school hours and in the evenings by the wider community).</p>

<p>We will not cover the additional rates costs associated with buildings which are not used to deliver education for pupils at the school.</p>

<p>For a smooth transition to the new payment system, we’d encourage schools to register buildings which are not used to deliver education for pupils at the school as a separate entity on the Valuation Office Agency’s (VOA) rating list.</p>

<p>This ensures that two individual bills are generated, meaning the bill data uploaded to ESFA by billing authorities will only relate to the parts of a school site used to deliver education and will exclude any other buildings.</p>

<p>This is likely to apply to schools which contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>several service providers (for example a private nursery attached to a primary school)</li>
  <li>other bodies which occupy specific buildings (for example a caretaker’s house or community swimming pool)</li>
</ul>
