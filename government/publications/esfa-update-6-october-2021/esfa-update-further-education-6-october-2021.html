<p>Eligible institutions are reminded to complete the <a href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/tuition-fund" class="govuk-link" rel="external">16 to 19 tuition fund form</a>.</p>

<p>The deadline for your submission is 11:59pm on 12 October 2021.</p>

<p>You can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-tuition-fund-2021-to-2022">guidance document</a> to help you complete the form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: our consultation on plans to simplify funding for all adult skills training is closing on 7 October 2021</h2>

<p>On Thursday 15 July 2021, the Department for Education made a series of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/skills-training-boosted-across-the-country">announcements on boosting the nation’s skills</a>, which included details on a <a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/fe-funding/reforms-to-funding-and-accountability/supporting_documents/Skills%20for%20JobsA%20New%20Further%20Education%20Funding%20and%20Accountability%20System.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">consultation</a> on plans to simplify funding for adult skills training.</p>

<p>The Skills for Jobs White Paper sets out our vision to transform further education. We want people to get the advanced technical and higher technical skills they need to get good jobs. Colleges’ place at the centre of their local communities and economies means that they are key to unlocking opportunities and to building back better.</p>

<p>This <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/fe-funding/reforms-to-funding-and-accountability/supporting_documents/Skills%20for%20JobsA%20New%20Further%20Education%20Funding%20and%20Accountability%20System.pdf" rel="external">consultation</a> delivers key commitments of the White Paper – it addresses the underlying system of complex funding for adult skills and limited focus on outcomes, through proposals to reform adult skills funding and the wider accountability system for colleges and other grant funded providers.</p>

<p>The consultation is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further education providers</li>
  <li>independent training providers</li>
  <li>local government (including local authorities, Mayoral Combined Authorities /Greater London Authority)</li>
  <li>employers</li>
  <li>learners</li>
  <li>representative bodies</li>
  <li>other interested parties</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers leaving their submissions until the last minute run the risk of not having made an accurate submission by the deadline to guarantee payments.</p>

<p>Ensuring you have resolved any data or funding errors prior to submission close will ensure we can process payments and issue reconciliation statements promptly.</p>

<p>Submitting your data early will increase your chances of correcting any problems before the deadline.

<span class="number">5. </span>Information: coronavirus national testing programme – conditions of grant from August 2021, including claims for exceptional funding and payments</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-national-testing-programme-conditions-of-grant-from-august-2021/coronavirus-covid-19-national-testing-programme-conditions-of-grant-from-august-2021">conditions of grant</a> for rapid coronavirus testing of staff and students in FE providers and secondary schools have been updated. These grant conditions relate to the allocation colleges will receive to support costs associated with testing from 23 August onwards, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the one-off on-site ATS testing on return of all students attending educational settings, with students receiving 2 lateral flow device (LFD) tests, spaced 3 to 5 days apart</li>
  <li>the maintenance of an on-site ATS testing offer from 18 September until further notice, in line with departmental testing policy, to enable the twice weekly testing of students for whom at-home testing is not considered suitable or who may need additional assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>A series of payments will be made to colleges, with payments being made retrospectively and based on information reported through Test and Trace. Further information <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges" class="govuk-link">about how much each institution has been allocated</a> for the periods of testing that have already been paid for is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>For testing conducted between 23 August and 17 September, we will make payments directly to colleges at the end of November 2021. For testing conducted from 18 September onwards, we will make payments directly to colleges in April 2022. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-national-testing-programme-conditions-of-grant-from-august-2021/coronavirus-covid-19-national-testing-programme-conditions-of-grant-from-august-2021#payments" class="govuk-link">Further information is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances we will consider claims for additional funding over a minimum level of £250 to cover other additional costs incurred by colleges. The window to claim for exceptional costs will be open by the end of the autumn term 2021 and will include colleges that had to hire additional premises or make significant alterations to their existing premises to conduct testing from 23 August to 17 September 2021. The link to claim exceptional costs will be available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges">coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding for schools and colleges: exceptional costs guidance page on GOV.UK</a> along with further guidance in due course.</p>

<p>We anticipate making payment for valid claims in January 2022.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Information: apprenticeships standards versioning report</h2>

<p>IFATE has updated the <a rel="external" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/developing-new-apprenticeships/revisions-status-report/" class="govuk-link">Revisions Status Report</a>. This report will be updated regularly to show which live standards have entered IFATE’s formal <a rel="external" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/developing-new-apprenticeships/revisions-adjustments-and-dispensations/" class="govuk-link">revisions process</a>, and the stage they are at in that process.</p>

<p>This regular dissemination of information aims to prewarn the sector that new versions are upcoming so it can prepare accordingly, and allow IFATE to consult the sector on the appropriate notice period for each version change. It forms part of wider enhancements to the introduction of new versions of apprenticeship standards to the market.</p>

<p>Providers and EPAOs should review this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-use-the-apprenticeships-standards-revision-status-report">note</a>, which provides further information on the report and the action that providers and EPAOs should take with it, as well as the wider enhancements that we are planning.</p>

<span class="number">10. </span>Information: Adult education budget (AEB) funding – Afghan adults</h2>

<p>Earlier in September, we confirmed some funding eligibility rules for Afghans arriving in England. This clarification should help with enquiries we have received.</p>

<p>All Afghan adults, who are being resettled through the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), are immediately eligible for FE 19+ funding as per the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2021-to-2022">AEB funding rules</a>.</p>

<p>Afghan adults and their family members resettled through ARAP and ACRS on or after 1 August 2021 will automatically receive ‘indefinite leave to remain’ making them exempt from the 3-year ordinary residence rule. Those Afghan adults coming to the UK under the ARAP scheme, and through the future ACRS are not classed as asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Afghan adults resettled through these schemes will also be eligible for unemployment benefits and have the right to work so will, in most cases, be fully funded for ESFA ESOL provision. The eligibility rules for fully funded English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) provision may differ depending on whether the individual is resident in a devolved or non-devolved AEB area.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that there may be some delays in the issue of the Home Office biometric residence permit (BRP), in these cases all individuals will be issued with a document showing proof of Home Office immigration status.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Information: ESFA AEB update for the Heavy Goods Vehicles offer</h2>

<p>The Department of Transport and Department of Education announced a joint collaboration to support the increase of qualified HGV drivers and address the current shortages in the sector.</p>

<p>As part of the announcement the ESFA will introduce flexibilities to their adult education budget (AEB) and associated funding rules, which enables providers to use their existing allocation for 2021 to 2022 to fund both medical and HGV licenses for any adult who completes one of the 5 HGV driving qualifications listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highfield Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>ProQual Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>Pearson Edexcel Level Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>ICQ Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>SQA Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>This change will be backdated and applied to anyone who started one of these ESFA AEB qualifications on or after 1 August 2021.</p>

<p>The changes will be reflected in version 3 of the ESFA AEB funding rules, which we will publish shortly. Any further updates will be released through the bulletin.</p>
