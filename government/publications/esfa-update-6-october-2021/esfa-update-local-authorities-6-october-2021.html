<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: adult education budget (AEB) funding – Afghan adults</h2>

<p>Earlier in September, we confirmed some funding eligibility rules for Afghans arriving in England. This clarification should help with enquiries we have received.</p>

<p>All Afghan adults, who are being resettled through the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP) and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS), are immediately eligible for FE 19+ funding as per the current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">AEB funding rules</a>.</p>

<p>Afghan adults and their family members resettled through ARAP and ACRS on or after 1 August 2021 will automatically receive ‘indefinite leave to remain’ making them exempt from the 3-year ordinary residence rule. Those Afghan adults coming to the UK under the ARAP scheme, and through the future ACRS are not classed as asylum seekers.</p>

<p>Afghan adults resettled through these schemes will also be eligible for unemployment benefits and have the right to work so will, in most cases, be fully funded for ESFA ESOL provision. The eligibility rules for fully funded English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) provision may differ depending on whether the individual is resident in a devolved or non-devolved AEB area.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that there may be some delays in the issue of the Home Office biometric residence permit (BRP), in these cases all individuals will be issued with a document showing proof of Home Office immigration status.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: ESFA AEB update for the Heavy Goods Vehicles offer</h2>

<p>The Department of Transport and Department of Education announced a joint collaboration to support the increase of qualified HGV drivers and address the current shortages in the sector.</p>

<p>As part of the announcement the ESFA will introduce flexibilities to their adult education budget (AEB) and associated funding rules, which enables providers to use their existing allocation for 2021 to 2022 to fund both medical and HGV licenses for any adult who completes one of the 5 HGV driving qualifications listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highfield Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>ProQual Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>Pearson Edexcel Level Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>ICQ Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
  <li>SQA Level 2 Certificate in Driving Goods Vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>This change will be backdated and applied to anyone who started one of these ESFA AEB qualifications on or after 1 August 2021.</p>

<p>The changes will be reflected in version 3 of the ESFA AEB funding rules, which we will publish shortly. Any further updates will be released through the bulletin.</p>
