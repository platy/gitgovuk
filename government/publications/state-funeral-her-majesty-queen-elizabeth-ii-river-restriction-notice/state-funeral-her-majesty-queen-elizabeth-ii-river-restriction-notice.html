<h2>When</h2>

<p>Monday 12 September to Tuesday 20 September 2022.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p>Bell Weir Lock to Boveney Lock.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<h1>General directions for navigation and mooring:</h1>

<p>We wish to ensure the safe transit and mooring of all boat owners intending to travel to or navigating through Windsor during this time. Those in charge of boats must conform with these directions and with any special directions which, at the discretion of the Harbourmaster, may be required in particular circumstances during these dates.</p>

<h1>Navigation</h1>

<p>All boats must navigate in accordance with instructions given from Environment Agency lock staff or patrol launches.</p>

<p>The navigation of all boats (except those authorised by the Environment Agency) will be restricted as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>all boats must navigate at slow speed and with extreme care and caution between Romney Lock and the A332 Queen Elizabeth road bridge</li>
  <li>no boats may anchor in any position between Romney Lock and the A332 road bridge. Anchoring outside of this area can only be carried out ensuring that no obstruction is caused to the navigation fairway or access to the banks for other boats</li>
  <li>during the course of normal navigation all boats should use the main fairway and should not pass on the Windsor side of Firework Ait</li>
  <li>all boats including manually propelled boats should maintain a proper look out at all times</li>
  <li>powered boats must not stop or loiter in the navigation channel, or otherwise impede or interfere with the navigation of any other boats between Bell Weir Lock and Boveney Lock. U-turns are not permitted between Windsor Bridge and the A332 road bridge, except when necessary for coming to or from moorings</li>
  <li>sailing boats can navigate only with oars as in number 3 above or mechanical power as in number 4 above and must not hoist their sail(s)</li>
  <li>no directions contained in this notice shall supersede those parts of Byelaw 24 of the Thames Navigation Licensing and General Byelaws 1993 as may be relevant</li>
</ol>

<p>From time to time information regarding navigation between Bell Weir and Boveney Locks may be broadcast on Channel 74 Marine Band VHF.</p>

<p>Please expect delays at the locks and possible restrictions as the funeral procession passes.</p>

<p>We expect the Windsor Reach to be very busy during these times. Therefore, we would like to remind river users that whilst navigating under bridges boats going upstream must give way to boats coming downstream. The headway at the highest point of Windsor Bridge is 4.01 metres or 13 feet and 2 inches. Headways are measured above standard head water level of the lock below, therefore the measurements given are for guidance only.</p>

<h1>Mooring</h1>

<p>Mooring must only take place with consent from the relevant landowner.</p>

<p>Boats must not be moored more than 3 hulls wide at the Brocas Meadow and 2 hulls wide at Baths Island and must not exceed a projection limit of 9 metres. Mooring in other locations must not cause a restriction or obstruction to navigation.</p>

<p>Owners and masters off all boats are reminded that it’s an offence for boats to carry more than twelve passengers unless a valid maritime and coastguard agency passenger carrying certificate is shown on board.</p>

<p>It is an offence to fail to conform with the directions in this notice or to obstruct an officer of the Environment Agency in the execution of their duty or to fail to obey directions given regarding the navigation, mooring or unmooring of any boat.</p>

<p>It is an offence to jump into the river or onto any vessel on the river from any place including a bridge or a highway or dive or swim or bathe in the river in such a manner as to cause obstruction, nuisance, annoyance or risk of danger or injury to persons or property. Bathing or swimming is prohibited at any time between Bell Weir Lock and Boveney Lock.</p>

<p>Before heading out on the water it is important to check that it is safe to do so. View the Environment Agency’s current <a class="govuk-link" href="http://riverconditions.environment-agency.gov.uk/" rel="external">river condition</a> advice.</p>
