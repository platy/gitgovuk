<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>A summary of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> in 2022</h2>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) is the first of 3 new environmental schemes being introduced under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agricultural-transition-plan-2021-to-2024">Agricultural Transition Plan</a>. The other 2 schemes are Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery.</p>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> aims to help farmers manage land in a way that improves food production and is more environmentally sustainable.</p>

<p>Farmers will be paid to provide public goods, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved water quality</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
  <li>climate change mitigation</li>
  <li>animal health and welfare</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2022, <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encourage actions that improve soil health</li>
  <li>recognise how moorland provides benefits to the public (public goods)</li>
  <li>improve animal health and welfare by helping farmers with the costs of veterinary advice for livestock</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>
<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements</h3>

<p>You’ll be eligible to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you’re a farmer who is eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), with land in England. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">eligibility for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4>Standards</h4>
<p>In 2022, there will be 3 standards available, with different levels and payments. Those are:</p>

</table>

<p>There will also be an additional annual payment of £6.15 per hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) for common land entered into a separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In the future, more standards will be introduced. You’ll be able to add these to your agreement, as well as increase levels and add land.</p>

<h4>Agreements</h4>
<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement will last for 3 years. You need to have ‘management control’ of the land entered into the agreement for its 3-year duration. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">eligibility</a> for more details about ‘management control’.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>You’ll be paid on a quarterly basis, with the first payment made 3 months after your agreement starts.</p>

<h4>Applying</h4>
<p>Applications for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement are expected to open from June 2022. They’ll remain open, so you can apply at a time that works best for you. If it’s necessary to close applications, this date will be publicised, including on GOV.UK, giving you 6 weeks’ notice.</p>

<h4>Capital items funding</h4>

<p>The standards will not include any capital items funding in 2022. You can apply for existing capital items funding offers on land parcels entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-capital-grants-manual">Countryside Stewardship capital grants</a>.</p>

<p>In the future, <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> will include capital items funding to help you complete the actions in the standards. More details about this will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Annual health and welfare review</h3>

<p>The annual health and welfare review will provide funding to eligible livestock farmers. This funding will cover the cost of an annual review of your livestock by a vet chosen by you.</p>

<p>This is part of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> offer in 2022 and sits alongside the environmental standards. You do not need to have an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to be eligible to apply for the annual health and welfare review funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Check your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> </h3>

<p>Before you apply, you need to check your digital maps are up to date. For each land parcel you’ll be including in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, check that: </p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s linked to your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) </li>
  <li>the land cover correctly reflects the use of the land parcel </li>
  <li>the permanent boundaries are correct</li>

<h4>How to view your digital maps </h4>

<p>To view your digital maps, sign into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. From your ‘Business overview’ screen, select ‘Land’ and ‘View land’.</p>

<p>Currently, common land is not shown on your digital maps. For <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, the RPA is looking at how this land information can be shared with you to help you apply. More information will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>What land is eligible for an agreement</h3>

<p>The land you enter into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement must be eligible for the standard selected. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible land type</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is and are shown on your digital maps.</p>

<p>The land cover is not the same as the land use you declare in your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. The land use describes the activities you’re using the land cover for. It is not shown on your digital maps. </p>

<p>A land parcel’s registered land cover must be compatible with the land use you declare for that land parcel in your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. For example, if the land use is temporary grassland, the registered land cover must be ‘Arable land’.</p>

<p>There are 4 land cover categories shown on your digital maps. These are listed here, with some examples of land uses declared in <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> applications for each land cover category.  </p>

<p>Certain identified land covers are eligible for each standard.</p>

<p>The ‘available area’ for each land parcel is shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This is based on the land cover currently registered that’s eligible for the standard you’ve chosen. When you select a land parcel, its total ‘available area’ is included. You cannot reduce this available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, for example, if only part of the ‘available area’ is eligible for the standard you choose.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of the broad category of land cover, for example different types of grassland or arable crop types.</p>

<p>A land parcel with an eligible land cover for the standard you choose must also be a land type that’s eligible for that standard. This means its total ‘available area’ shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application must be an eligible land type.</p>

<p>You can only include a land parcel’s total ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>If only part of the ‘available area’ in a land parcel is an eligible land type for the standard you’ve chosen, you cannot reduce its available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. In this case, you must not include that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel with a Permanent Grassland land cover and you choose the improved grassland soils standard, the total ‘available area’ based on the eligible land cover is 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>. If the land type is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved permanent grassland for the whole 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you can enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
  <li>improved permanent grassland for only 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you must not enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example would be if you have an 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> land parcel with an Arable land cover. If you choose the arable and horticultural soils standard, the total ‘available area’ is 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>. If the land type is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved temporary grassland for the whole 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you can enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
  <li>improved temporary grassland for only 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you must not enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The eligible type of land for each standard is explained in the guidance for the individual standards (under ‘Eligible land’).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>How to update your land details </h3>

<p>When you update a land parcel’s details on your digital maps, this affects all the land-based schemes that land parcel is used for. This includes <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is important to consider if you’re updating the land cover to enter a land parcel into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The land cover must be compatible with the land use declared on your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. If it’s not, that will affect your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. </p>

<h4>RLE1 form and guidance</h4>
<p>You’ll usually need to use an RLE1 form and sketch maps to update your land details. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use/">Read the RLE1 guidance</a> for more information about completing the RLE1 form and sketch maps. </p>

<p>Submit the RLE1 form and sketch maps to the RPA. You need to wait for your land details to be updated on your digital maps before continuing with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. If you do not, that land may not be available to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>You can email the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers?msclkid=8ec43774af4111ec9df71e1f9607f818">electronic RLE1 form</a> to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Check you and your land are eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>

<p>To enter into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement, both you and your land must be eligible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Your eligibility to apply for an agreement</h3>

<p>To be eligible to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement in 2022 your business, the Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) that’s applying for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>). This means the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> must have at least 5 hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land and 5 or more <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements on 16 May 2022.</p>

<p>The 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land does not set a minimum eligible area for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as there is no minimum area.</p>

<p>Your business does not need to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 or to have received <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the past. This rule is simply to limit applicants to those who are eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>. This requirement will be removed in later years, so a wider range of farmers can apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, but that’s unlikely to happen before 2024.</p>

<p>If you apply for a separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land or an area of shared grazing, this <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule works differently. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#commons-and-shared-grazing-land">common land and shared grazing</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Your land’s eligibility</h3>

<p>A land parcel is eligible to be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is wholly located in England</li>
  <li>its registered land cover (shown on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service) and its land type are eligible for the standards you choose</li>
  <li>you will have management control of the land for the duration of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose which eligible land parcels to enter. You do not have to include all of your land parcels and there is no minimum or maximum area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Eligible land cover and type of land</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement that’s eligible for the standard you choose. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible land type</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>
<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is. There are 4 categories of land cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arable Land</li>
  <li>Permanent Grassland</li>
  <li>Permanent Crops</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service.</p>

<p>Certain identified land covers are eligible for each standard. You can find out which land covers are eligible for each of the standards in each of the standards.</p>

<p>The ‘available area’ for each land parcel is shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This is based on the land cover currently registered that’s eligible for the standard you have chosen. When you select a land parcel, its total ‘available area’ is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce this available area in your application.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose the arable and horticultural soils standard and select a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel that has 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of Arable land cover and 2 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of ‘Other’ non-agricultural woodland land cover, the available area for this standard is 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>. You can only include this 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it to 7 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of the broad category of land cover. For example, different types of grassland or arable crop types.</p>

<p>A land parcel with an eligible land cover for the standard you choose must also be a land type that’s eligible for that standard. This means its total ‘available area’ shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application must be an eligible land type.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose the improved grassland soils standard, the land parcel must be improved grassland.</p>

<p>This is explained under ‘Eligible land’ in the information on each standard. You can also read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">eligible land covers and land types</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Management control of land</h3>

<p>To enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement you must have management control of that land for the 3-year duration of the agreement.</p>

<p>You will have management control if you have sufficient control over how the land is managed to complete the actions in the standards chosen, for the duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This will usually mean you’re the person actively farming the land who is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the owner occupier, farming the land yourself or employing a contractor</li>
  <li>a tenant with a Farm Business Tenancy (FBT) under the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, or an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy</li>
  <li>in a group that farms on common land (including areas of shared grazing)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you declare that you will have management control of that land for the agreement’s 3-year duration. You must supply evidence to show this if we ask for it.</p>

<p>The following information explains what management control means for tenants, licensors and commoners.</p>

<h4>Management control of tenanted land</h4>

<p>Only a tenant can enter land occupied under a tenancy into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is because they’re the person actively farming the land, not the landlord.</p>

<p>As a tenant, it’s your responsibility to check whether your tenancy agreement allows you to complete the actions in the standards you select.</p>

<p>If you occupy land under a tenancy on a ‘rolling’ year-by-year basis, you can only enter this land into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you expect to have management control of that land for its 3-year duration. For example, this may be the case if you occupy land under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an FBT granted for a term of more than 2 years, that continues on a rolling year-by-year basis after its initial term ends</li>
  <li>an FBT granted for a term of 2 years or less that you expect your landlord to renew on an annual basis</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not enter land into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you do not expect to have management control of that land for its 3-year duration.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure whether you will have management control of the land occupied under a tenancy for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you should check with your landlord.</p>

<p>If you unexpectedly lose management control of the land occupied under a tenancy during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must tell us as soon as reasonably practicable. We will remove that land from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If your loss of management control was because of a change of circumstances, you may not have to repay payments already received. Unlike previous schemes, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied.</p>

<p>For more information, read about <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-works">what happens if you cannot deliver your agreement, or your circumstances change</a>.</p>

<h4>Management control of land you access under a licence</h4>

<p>If you only have access to land under a licence arrangement (so you’re a licensee), it’s unlikely you have sufficient management control of that land to complete the actions in the standards.</p>

<p>In this case, the licensor (usually the owner occupier) could enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and make the licensee aware of its requirements, if relevant.</p>

<p>If in practice your arrangement with the landowner gives you wider land management responsibilities, similar to those of a tenant, you may be able to enter this land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. For example, some licences on Ministry of Defence land operate in this way. If this applies, you should refer to the information on tenanted land above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as Countryside Stewardship, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you and your land are eligible for each scheme</li>
  <li>the activities you’re being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>you are not being paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as ‘double funding’)</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">the interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> with other schemes</a>.</p>

<h4>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-regulatory-issues-and-consents">regulatory issues and consents</a> to find out how to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h4>

<p>Land designated as an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> is eligible for the standards available in 2022, but you may need consent from Natural England. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-regulatory-issues-and-consents">regulatory issues and consents</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Eligibility of commons and shared grazing land for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>This information explains the eligibility requirements for common land or an area of shared grazing to be entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement.</p>

<p>You should read this information with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sustainable-farming-incentive-guidance">other Sustainable Farming Incentive standards information</a> which applies to all <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements.</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this information if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you don’t have to follow it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Definition of common land and shared grazing</h3>

<p>For the purposes of an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, ‘common land’ means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land registered as common land in a register of common land kept under Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006</li>
  <li>land to which Part 1 of that Act does not apply and which is subject to rights of common within the meaning of that Act</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Shared grazing’ means communal pasture that isn’t registered as common land where graziers have a legal entitlement to graze. For example, a pasture used jointly by tenants.</p>

<p>The following information about commons also applies to areas of shared grazing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Applying for an agreement on common land</h3>

<p>You must enter common land or an area of shared grazing into its own <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The agreement cannot include other land you own or rent that is not common land.</p>

<p>This means that you must submit separate applications in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the common land and shared grazing, using the existing single entity’s Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) or a new <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> if a single entity needs to be set up</li>
  <li>land you own or rent that is not common land, using the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> for your own business</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Eligibility to enter common land into an agreement</h3>

<p>To enter common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) eligibility rule</li>
  <li>be a single entity, either as a sole beneficiary or a group</li>
  <li>have a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement for a group</li>
  <li>have sufficient management control of the common land to complete the actions for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>The following information gives more information about each of these requirements.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule</h4>

<p>You must be eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement in 2022.</p>

<p>For common land, the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule is met if one or more people were eligible to use the common to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2021 or 2022. They don’t need to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 or to have received <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the past.</p>

<h4>Only a ‘single entity’ can apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on commons</h4>

<p>Only a ‘single entity’ can enter into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on a common. This is to make sure that, where there is a group, the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement can be delivered by the single entity for the agreement’s 3-year duration.</p>

<p>A single entity can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a person who will be the sole beneficiary</li>
  <li>a group of two or more people with a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement between them, a nominated representative and a single bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>A sole beneficiary will usually be a landowner who owns the whole common and has sole use and rights to the common.</p>

<p>A group may already have a single entity to oversee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an existing Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) or Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) agreement on the common</li>
  <li>general management of the common</li>
</ul>

<p>This could be a commons association or an internal agreement.</p>

<p>It should be possible for the group to extend the scope of the existing single entity. This single entity should apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, using the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> it already has.</p>

<p>If a group has not already set up a single entity, it will need to do this before it applies for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on the common. It must register with the RPA for a new <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>, even if some of the members already have their own SBIs individually.</p>

<p>To help a group set up a single entity, more information will be published on GOV.UK before applications open and you should read that information before setting up a single entity.</p>

<h5>Additional payment for a single entity on common land</h5>

<p>To help with the costs of administering an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land, there is an annual additional payment of £6.15 per hectare of eligible common land entered into its own <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. It is only available to a single entity entering common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In future, as more standards are made available, this additional payment will continue to be paid per hectare of eligible common land entered into the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, irrespective of the number of standards in the agreement.</p>

<p>This payment will be kept under review as <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Common land eligibility</h3>

<p>An area of common land is eligible to be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s wholly located in England</li>
  <li>the type of land and its mapped land cover are eligible for the standard(s) selected</li>
  <li>the single entity will have sufficient management control for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Eligible land cover and type of land</h3>

<p>You can only enter an area of common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if it’s eligible for the standard you choose. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the ‘Eligible land’ section in each standard for more information about eligible land cover and land type.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel outside a common on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a>. However, common land is not currently shown on these maps. The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is looking at how these land details, including land cover, can be shared with you to help you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land. More information will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h4>What area of common land can be entered into <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>
</h4>

<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a whole common</li>
  <li>more than one whole common, if they are adjacent and managed as a single unit</li>
  <li>part of a common, if it’s a defined area that’s managed as a separate, single unit and the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement won’t impact land management practices on the remaining part of the common</li>
</ul>

<p>If the common is in an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement, that same land can be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s eligible for the standards selected</li>
  <li>the activities being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>a similar activity isn’t being paid for on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Management control</h3>

<p>To enter common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, the single entity must have sufficient management control of that land for the 3-year duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>The single entity should have management control of the common land if it has sufficient control over how the land is managed to complete the actions in the standards chosen for the duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>The single entity must judge whether it has sufficient management control. This does not mean that every commoner has to agree or become part of the single entity. However, it does mean that those who are part of the single entity need to be able to deliver the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>To have sufficient management control, the group will need to consider whether the landowner needs to be part of the single entity or give their consent.</p>

<p>Before applying for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, the single entity must notify all other known parties who have a legal interest in the common that it intends to apply. This is to make sure all commoners and the landowner are aware of what is being proposed. It is also part of the single entity establishing that it has sufficient management control of the common land.</p>

<p>When the single entity enters common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it declares that it will have management control of that land for the agreement’s 3-year duration. The single entity must supply evidence of this if the RPA asks for it.</p>

<p>More information about management control for a group will be published on GOV.UK before applications open. You should read that information before applying for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>We will continue to work with commons representatives to make sure <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> works for commoners.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>How an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement interacts with other funding schemes</h2>
<p>This information explains the interaction between land entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement and other schemes, as well as other funding sources.</p>

<p>Existing schemes will continue to run alongside <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), until it is delinked in 2024</li>
  <li>Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Environmental Stewardship</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of 2024, new schemes will also be launched, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Nature Recovery</li>
  <li>Landscape Recovery</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Including land in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and other schemes at the same time</h3>

<p>It’s possible to include the same land in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and another scheme if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you and your land are eligible for each scheme</li>
  <li>the activities or outcomes you’re being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>you are not being paid for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Basic Payment Scheme</h3>

<p>You can include the same land parcel in a <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application and your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as it’s eligible for each scheme.</p>

<p>If you apply for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-payments-for-farmers-who-leave-or-retire-from-farming-and-delinked-payments/lump-sum-exit-scheme-and-delinked-payments-how-the-payments-will-work">Lump Sum Exit Scheme</a> in 2022, you should not apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>. If you decide to withdraw your Lump Sum Exit Scheme application, you can then apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Countryside Stewardship</h3>

<p>The interaction between an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> is different depending on whether there’s a revenue option or capital items funding.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options</h4>

<p>If land used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
  <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option, cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>be used to complete any of the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you cannot enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an area of land used to establish a cover crop under <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> into the arable and horticultural soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
  <li>an area of land used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grass buffer strip on an improved grassland parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard you choose affects which <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h5>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options and the moorland standard</h5>

<p>Land used for all <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard, if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h5>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options and the soils standards</h5>

<p>You can enter land used for certain <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options into the introductory and intermediate levels in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="#improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a> in 2022.</p>

<p>These eligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options are set out in tables 1 and 2.</p>

<p>If you use an area of a land parcel for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option not listed in tables 1 and 2 above, that area cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>However, you can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>For example, if part of a land parcel is used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grass buffer strip, you can enter the rest of the area into either of the soils standards.</p>

<h4>Rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options</h4>

<p>A rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> option. You do this either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
  <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option listed in table 3 cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>You can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, the rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options listed in table 3 above can be located on land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is because the area of rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options has already been removed from your ‘available area’, so there’s no risk of double funding.</p>

<h4>Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you have an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement</h4>

<p>If you have an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, the following areas are automatically removed from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options (those not listed in tables 1 and 2 above)</li>
  <li>the area currently used for ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options (which are listed in table 3 above)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the area is not included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. For example, if there is a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel which has 2 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of AB2 (Basic overwinter stubble), the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application will be 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> in 2022</h4>

<p>You may be applying for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Higher Tier or Mid Tier (including the Wildlife Offers) agreement starting from 1 January 2023. This may affect your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application if you include the same area of land in both <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application and receive your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement offer before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, any area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options can be confirmed before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, the following areas are automatically removed from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options (those not listed in tables 1 and 2 above)</li>
  <li>the area currently used for ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options (which are listed in table 3 above)</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the area isn’t included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>However, if the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options cannot be confirmed, it won’t be possible to automatically remove it from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This will be the case if you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> before you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application.</p>

<p>This means the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options is included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You can only enter the total ‘available area’ into the standard you choose. It cannot be reduced in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application to remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>If you enter the same area of land into both an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> soils standard and an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option in a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement that starts from 1 January 2023, your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payment will be automatically adjusted.</p>

<p>For example, you enter a 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> land parcel into one of the soils standards and include that same land parcel in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application. You have only included 1 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of this land parcel in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application, but it’s in an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option for the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> soils standard you have chosen. If your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement starts after your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you will only be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payment on 9 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of that land parcel.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> capital items funding</h4>

<p>If you apply for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Capital Grants agreement, the same land parcel can be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Environmental Stewardship</h3>

<p>Land in an existing Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) agreement can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard. This is because the introductory level pays you to assess the moorland and produce plans, and <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> funds physical actions. This means you aren’t being paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding).</p>

<p>Before <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> applications open, we’ll publish more information on GOV.UK about the eligibility of land in <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements for both of the soils standards.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot</h3>

<p>Land parcels already in a Sustainable Farming Incentive pilot standards agreement cannot be entered into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Local Nature Recovery</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work">Local Nature Recovery</a> (LNR) is expected to launch by the end of 2024. You’ll be able to apply for LNR options on land entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<p>The LNR options will initially cover the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing feeding, shelter and breeding areas for wildlife on arable farms</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating grassland habitats such as species-rich grassland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating wetland habitats such as ponds, lakes, reedbeds and fens</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating lowland heathland</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating coastal habitats such as sand dunes, salt marsh and shingle</li>
  <li>managing and restoring areas of upland and lowland peat and moorland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
  <li>targeted measures to support the recovery and reintroduction of particular wildlife species, such as creating and managing nesting and feeding habitat, and to tackle non-native invasive species</li>
  <li>managing and creating trees and woodlands, including agroforestry, traditional orchards and tree planting on areas of farms (the England Woodland Creation Offer will be the main scheme for creating woodland until 2025)</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions for water, such as creating and managing in-field vegetation, buffer strips and swales to reduce and filter runoff and contribute to natural flood management</li>
  <li>restoring rivers, flood plains, streams and riparian habitats</li>
</ul>

<p>More LNR guidance will be published on GOV.UK over the next year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Landscape Recovery</h3>

<p>You can apply for Landscape Recovery on land entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>Farming in Protected Landscapes</h3>

<p>If you have land in a National Park Authority or Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) you can apply for Farming in Protected Landscapes funding and enter that same land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>This is because the funding available under Farming in Protected Landscapes does not pay for the same land management actions as <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Private sector schemes</h4>

<p>In 2022, you can enter the same area of land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and a private sector scheme arrangement, such as carbon trading or payments for natural flood management.</p>

<p>This is only possible if you are not being paid twice for similar environmental land management actions legally required in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and the private sector scheme.</p>

<p>You also need to meet the rules and requirements of the private sector scheme, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the environmental outcome is additional to what you’re delivering in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement (‘additionality’)</li>
  <li>verification of the environmental outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach to private sector schemes will be reviewed by Defra annually.</p>

<h4>Other funding sources</h4>

<p>You cannot enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you are receiving funding from another source to do similar environmental land management actions on that land.</p>

<p>This includes funding received from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>National Park Authorities or AONB grant schemes, apart from Farming in Protected Landscapes</li>
  <li>the Highways Agency</li>
  <li>the National Lottery</li>
  <li>a crown body, such as the Duchy of Cornwall</li>
  <li>energy and water companies</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Check regulatory issues and consents that could affect an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>This information covers some of the land-based regulatory issues and consents that may affect you and your land. You must comply with all the other legal requirements that apply to you and your land.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement conflicts with any statutory requirements for the management of the land, you must comply with those statutory requirements.</p>

<p>You will need to check if the land you’re entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has scheduled monuments, historic or archaeological features</li>
  <li>is in a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the land is affected by one of these it may affect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what you are able to do on that land</li>
  <li>whether you need to get consent before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h3>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland soils standard on any area with historical or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You will still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. Once you’ve registered you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h3>

<p>If you have land in an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> that you’re entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you may need consent from Natural England before your agreement can start. This depends on which standard you’re applying for.</p>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the arable and horticultural soils standard, but you will need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">consent from Natural England</a>. Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement cannot start until Natural England gives this consent. Before applications open, we’ll publish information on GOV.UK about when to request this consent.</p>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland standard. You must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land. This means you do not need consent from Natural England to enter <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land into this standard.</p>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory level of the moorland standard. You do not need consent from Natural England to enter <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land into this standard as the actions in the introductory level do not require you to undertake <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> prohibited activities on the land.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Cross compliance</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cross-compliance-2022">cross compliance rules</a> do not apply to an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. However, you still need to meet any regulatory requirements that apply to you or your land. Being in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not remove these requirements.</p>

<p>You must follow the cross compliance rules if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have land in other rural payments schemes covered by these rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Protected species</h3>

<p>You may need a wildlife licence if any of the actions in the standards you include in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application may affect protected species. You should keep the licence for evidence. You can read more information at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-wildlife-on-your-land">managing wildlife on your land on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span>Work affecting water</h3>

<p>If you’re doing any work that may affect watercourses, you may need consent from the Environment Agency, or the relevant internal drainage board or local authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>How an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement works</h2>
<p>This information explains what you’re agreeing to when you enter into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement, when it will start and what changes you can request once your agreement starts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Entering into an agreement</h2>

<p>When you submit your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, the Rural Payment Agency (RPA) will process it. You’ll be notified when your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement offer is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> to check.</p>

<p>To enter into the agreement, you must accept it and sign it digitally. Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement cannot start until you do this.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement comprises of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the agreement document</li>
  <li>the scheme terms and conditions, which will be published on GOV.UK before applications open</li>
</ul>

<p>By accepting your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you are agreeing to follow the scheme terms and conditions. You should read them carefully before you accept it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>When your agreement will start</h2>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements will not all start on a single date. The start date for your agreement will depend on when you submit your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, how long it takes to process and how quickly you accept your agreement offer.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement will last for 3 years from its start date, as shown on your agreement document.</p>

<p>If you apply when applications open in June 2022, it’s likely your agreement will start in autumn 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Submit an annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement</h2>

<p>You must submit an annual declaration for each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is to confirm your progress with completing the actions in your agreement.</p>

<p>You’ll complete and submit your annual declaration online. The RPA will remind you when it’s due and provide more information to help you complete it.</p>

<p>Before applications open, more information about the annual declaration will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Requesting changes to your agreement</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to request certain changes to your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Upgrading your agreement</h3>
<p>You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually. This will allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add more standards as they become available</li>
  <li>add more land, including land coming out of a Countryside Stewardship agreement when it ends</li>
  <li>increase levels within standards already in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about upgrading your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Reducing the levels in the standards or land area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement or ending it early</h3>

<p>You’re usually expected to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for its 3-year duration without:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing the level that you’ve selected for a standard</li>
  <li>removing land from the agreement</li>
  <li>ending the agreement early</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain situations, it may be possible for you to reduce the levels in the standards or area of land in your agreement or end it before its 3-year duration is completed. For example, the RPA may agree to do this if you have a change of circumstances that makes it impossible for you to deliver all or part of the agreement.</p>

<p>If the levels of the standards or area of land in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement are reduced, or it’s ended early, you may have to repay some, or all, of the money already paid to you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement payments are based on you completing the actions in the standards for a full agreement year, including submitting your annual declaration. If you have done this, you will not have to repay the money already paid to you. If you have not, you may need to make a repayment for the affected agreement year.</p>

<h4>Transferring an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to another person</h4>

<p>It will not usually be possible for you to transfer an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to another person.</p>

<p>If land in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement is transferred to another person, for example, it is sold or a tenancy ends and there is a new tenant, you must inform the RPA as soon as possible. The RPA will advise you what needs to happen.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Getting paid for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>This information explains how your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement payment will be calculated, when you’ll be paid and what you must do to get paid.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>How your payment is calculated</h3>

<p>The total annual payment for your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement is based on the number the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level of a standard.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Standard</th>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Moorland</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£10.30 per hectare</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Where relevant, your total annual payment may also include an additional payment for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the moorland standard (£265 per agreement per year)</li>
  <li>common land entered into a separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement (£6.15 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>When you will be paid</h3>
<p>The total annual payment value is divided into 4 equal instalments. The first quarterly payment will usually be made 3 months after the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> when applications open, your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement should start this autumn. In this case, your first quarterly payment should be made before the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Unlike other schemes, such as Countryside Stewardship, you don’t need to submit an annual revenue claim before you get paid. Your quarterly payments will usually be made automatically.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span>What you must do to get paid</h3>

<p>To get paid under your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete the actions in the standards you have chosen for a full agreement year</li>
  <li>submit your annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement</li>
  <li>supply evidence specified in the standards when we ask for it</li>
</ul>

<p>A full agreement year means each 12-month period from the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If the levels of the standards or area of land in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement are reduced, or it’s ended early, you may have to repay some or all of the money already paid to you. Read more about requesting changes to your agreement.</p>

<p>If you do not submit an annual declaration, your payments could be withheld. Read more about submitting an annual declaration</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.4 </span>Future changes to actions in the standards and payment rates</h3>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, the actions and payment rates for the standards you have chosen will not change.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>We will use a new, supportive approach for checking progress of your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement and that you’ve met its terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If you cannot deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll start by helping you to fix what’s gone wrong, wherever possible. Unlike previous schemes, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied.</p>

<p>The standards have been designed to include actions that you should be able to complete, to achieve the set of aims for each standard. You must do what’s required, but it’s up to you how to complete the actions, so you can make them work for your farm.</p>

<p>While the actions avoid being prescriptive, some do require you to complete an action on a percentage of land entered into the standard. In this case, it’s worth allowing a margin of error.</p>

<p>For example, in the arable and horticultural soils standard you must have at least 70% winter cover on land entered into the standard. You may want to try to do this on a slightly larger area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>What we may check</h3>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we may check that you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meeting your agreement’s terms and conditions</li>
  <li>achieving the aims of the standards, by completing the required actions in a way that works on your farm</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>How we’ll check your agreement</h3>

<p>We’ll use a range of methods to check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reviewing the annual declaration that you submit</li>
  <li>checking evidence we ask a proportion of agreement holders to supply, such as a soil management plan or soil organic matter test results</li>
  <li>carrying out site visits (physical or by video call) for a proportion of agreement holders</li>
  <li>using remote monitoring technology, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery</li>
</ul>

<h4>Annual declaration</h4>

<p>You must submit an annual declaration for each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is to confirm your progress on completing the actions in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Evidence you need to keep</h4>

<p>You can find out what evidence to keep for each action in the details of each standard. The evidence will show what you’ve done to complete the action. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<p>By completing all of the actions under the level selected for the standards, you should achieve the set of aims for that standard. The aim for each action is also explained in the details of each standard.</p>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the action’s aim, we may ask you for the evidence to show what you’ve done to complete the action.</p>

<h4>Site visits</h4>

<p>If your farm is selected for a site visit, we’ll try to arrange a suitable time and date with you in advance and let you know what to expect during the visit.</p>

<p>If that’s not possible, we’ll write to you by post or email explaining the purpose, date and time of the visit. This will be at least 48 hours before the visit.</p>

<p>An RPA field officer will then visit your farm. In most cases, the site visit will involve a discussion with you about how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the aims of the standards in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement have been achieved</li>
  <li>the actions in the standards have been completed</li>
</ul>

<p>Where necessary to guide improvements, the RPA field officer will be able to conduct a review of all aspects of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/405/part/6/made" rel="external">the legislation</a> for the exact details of what someone visiting (or ‘authorised person’) can do.</p>

<h4>Remote monitoring</h4>

<p>Remote monitoring uses aerial photography and satellite imagery to monitor things like land cover, vegetation condition and soil erosion risk.</p>

<p>Remote monitoring aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the number of physical site visits</li>
  <li>make sure the standards are delivering environmental benefits</li>
  <li>automatically identify potential issues so that you can be given targeted support and guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span>What happens if you cannot deliver your agreement, or your circumstances change</h3>

<p>If you find that you cannot deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll try to be flexible and start by helping you to fix what’s gone wrong.</p>

<p>You may be unable to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement because something happens that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevents you completing the required actions</li>
  <li>affects how you can deliver your agreement</li>
  <li>means your circumstances change</li>
</ul>

<p>This may be for reasons within or outside your control.</p>

<p>If this is the case, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contacting-the-rpa-about-sfi">notify us</a>, in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable, if that change of circumstances affects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your eligibility</li>
  <li>the amount of money you should get</li>
  <li>your ability to deliver actions in the standards within your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> agreement</li>
  <li>your ability to comply with scheme terms and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>When you write to us, you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>your agreement reference number</li>
  <li>as many details as possible about the change of circumstances, including specific details about the standards you’re having issues with</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll look at each change of circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Depending on what’s happened, we may decide to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amend your agreement</li>
  <li>end your agreement early</li>
  <li>adjust your payments</li>
  <li>ask you to repay money already paid to you</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can use the complaints process to ask for it to be reconsidered. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you are notified of our decision.</p>

<p>It will be a breach of your agreement if you do not tell us about the change of circumstances when you are required to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span>How you could breach your agreement</h3>

<p>You could breach your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you do not meet its terms and conditions.</p>

<p>This includes if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not complete the actions required in the standards</li>
  <li>do not report, as soon as reasonably practicable, a change of circumstances which affects your ability to deliver your agreement</li>
  <li>give false or misleading information</li>
  <li>do not provide information or evidence when it’s asked for, in the way it’s asked for</li>
  <li>prevent a site visit from being carried out</li>
  <li>refuse to assist an authorised person during a site visit</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span>What happens if there has been a suspected breach</h3>

<p>We may find a suspected breach during checks on the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If this happens, we will investigate the suspected breach. Unlike previous schemes, we will not usually withhold your payments if a breach is suspected.</p>

<p>Where possible we’ll discuss this investigation with you, so you understand what we’ve considered. You may also be asked to supply further information or evidence to us as part of this investigation.</p>

<p>Once we’ve completed our investigation, we’ll tell you the outcome. If you do not agree with the outcome, you’ll have the opportunity to make written representations on why you do not agree. When we write to you with the outcome of the investigation, we’ll explain how to make written representations, including the time limit for submitting these to us.</p>

<p>We’ll consider your written representations before making a formal determination on whether there has been a breach.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.6 </span>What happens if a breach is confirmed</h3>

<p>If we decide that there has been a breach of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll write to inform you of this within a reasonable period. We’ll give you the reasons for this decision. We’ll then decide what action needs to be taken, if any.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll look at the individual circumstances of your case and consider various factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the seriousness of the breach</li>
  <li>if you had a good reason for the breach</li>
  <li>why the breach happened and any consequences it may have</li>
  <li>what impact the breach has on delivering the aims of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, and whether that impact will be short or longer term</li>
  <li>if you can take action to make sure you are delivering your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>any past conduct and whether similar breaches have happened before</li>
  <li>if you intentionally breached your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>whether the breach constitutes an offence and has caused widespread or irreparable damage</li>
  <li>if you have not co-operated with us checking on your progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>whether you’ve notified us about a change of circumstances, if relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> to ask for it to be reconsidered. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you are notified about our decision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.7 </span>Good reasons for a breach</h3>

<p>There may be a ‘good reason’ for a breach of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, for reasons outside your control.</p>

<p>In this case, you (or someone authorised to act on your behalf) must write to us to explain this.</p>

<p>If your good reason relates to a site visit, you must write to us immediately. In all other cases, you must do this within 8 weeks from either the date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are able to</li>
  <li>we notify you of the breach</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, we’ll also take good reasons into account when we investigate suspected breaches. During this investigation, if we agree that there are good reasons for a breach, we may be able to tell you during that investigation what, if anything, needs to be done.</p>

<p>Good reasons for a breach include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>natural events, such as prolonged adverse weather conditions, flooding, or animal or plant disease</li>
  <li>if you are seriously ill</li>
  <li>the death of an agreement holder</li>
  <li>unforeseen loss of management control of land, for example when a tenancy is terminated, or because of the compulsory purchase of land by a third party</li>
  <li>financial circumstances, such as bankruptcy</li>
  <li>evidenced supply chain problems, such as a lack of soil testing capacity</li>
  <li>criminal damage by a third party, such as arson or vandalism</li>
</ul>

<p>When you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contacting-the-rpa-about-sfi">write to us</a>, you should include your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>), agreement reference number and explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what has happened</li>
  <li>what good reason led to the breach</li>
  <li>whether you can fix the problem</li>
  <li>how the good reason meant you were unable to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>any evidence or information that may support your case</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider your individual situation and may ask for additional evidence</li>
  <li>decide what action, if any, needs to be taken</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are aware of the issue when entering into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it’s unlikely we’ll consider it to be a good reason for a breach.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.8 </span>What action we may take when there is a breach</h3>

<p>We may not take any action at all depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the nature of the breach</li>
  <li>any evidence you supply of a good reason for the breach</li>
</ul>

<p>If we need to take action, we’ll look at what you can do to fix what’s gone wrong with the delivery of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. We may also consider taking more formal action to deal with the breach.</p>

<p>If we need to take more formal action, you may have to repay some or all of the payments already made to you. This is because your payments are based on you completing the actions in the standards for a full agreement year, including submitting your annual declaration. A full agreement year means each 12-month period from the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If you have to make a repayment, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied, as used to be applied under previous schemes.</p>

<p>If we decide it’s possible for you to fix what’s gone wrong with the delivery of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we will write to you and explain what you must do.</p>

<p>If you do this within the relevant full agreement year, you will not have to repay payments already received for that year.</p>

<p>If you do not do this within the relevant full agreement year, you will not have completed all the actions you need to. This means you will have to repay payments already received for that year. We may also amend your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Depending on the circumstances, your future payments may be reduced or withheld.</p>

<p>We may decide that there is a serious breach because it was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intentional</li>
  <li>due to negligence or recklessness</li>
  <li>has happened more than once, without good reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case of a serious breach, we could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>end your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>prevent you from receiving payments under any other financial assistance scheme for up to 2 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where there is evidence of fraud or illegality, we will pursue that in line with the law on those issues.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>How the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards work</h2>
<p>A standard is a group of land management actions with a set of aims. By completing the actions in the standard, you should achieve its aims.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>The standards available in 2022</h3>

<p>There are 3 standards available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#moorland-standard">moorland</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can only enter a land parcel into one of these 3 standards. In future, standards will be designed to be compatible with each other. You will be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<p>You may already be doing some of these actions on your land. If this is the case, these will usually count towards achieving the standard’s aims.</p>

<p>You will not be paid for actions you are already required to do by law.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>The levels available in each standard in 2022</h3>

<p>The actions in each standard are grouped into levels. The information for each standard explains what is required at each level and how to achieve its aims.</p>

<p>If you choose a higher level, you have to do more actions and you will be paid more.</p>

<p>The levels you can choose in 2022 are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Standard</th>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arable and horticultural soils</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Improved grassland soils</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Moorland</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each land parcel can only be in one level, but you don’t have to choose the same level for all the land parcels entered into a standard. For example, you can select one land parcel for the introductory level and another land parcel for the intermediate level.</p>

<p>By 2025, these standards will all have 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
  <li>advanced</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Future standards and levels</h3>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) starts with 3 standards in 2022. It will expand each year, with the full set of standards in place by 2025.</p>

<p>Along with a wider range of standards, higher levels for existing standards will be added between now and 2025.</p>

<p>Each year you will be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add more standards</li>
  <li>increase levels for existing standards in your agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that each year there will be more you can choose to do and you’ll get paid more as a result.</p>

<p>You will not usually be able to remove standards, reduce levels for existing standards or remove land from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>These new standards and additional levels are only an indication of what may be introduced. They may be changed based on feedback from farmers and others.</p>

<p>In the future, we will continue to evaluate the success of <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> as the scheme develops. We may make changes to standards and levels, where necessary, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure there is value for public money</li>
  <li>secure the right outcomes for the environment</li>
  <li>take account of new or amended regulations</li>
  <li>avoid duplication, for example with private sector funding or accreditation schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>If we change standards or levels, these changes will only apply to land being entered into the standard or level for the first time or when an existing <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement is renewed at the end of its 3-year duration.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> arable and horticultural soils standard</h2>
<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the arable and horticultural soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h4>How the arable and horticultural soils standard will improve the environment</h4>
<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the arable and horticultural soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water quality</li>
  <li>climate resilience</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Eligible land for the arable and horticultural soils standard</h4>

<p>You can only enter land into the arable and horticultural soils standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>
<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-your-land-details">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the arable and horticultural soils standard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arable Land</li>
  <li>Permanent Crops (only perennial crops)</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard if its land type is cultivated arable land. This includes land used for horticultural crops, such as field vegetables, and temporary grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise cultivated arable land parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable land and enter it into the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
  <li>improved grassland and enter it into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for 5 consecutive years or more becomes classified as permanent grassland. If you enter temporary grassland into the arable and horticultural soils standard that becomes permanent grassland during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, that land will no longer be eligible for this standard. You may want to consider entering it into the improved grassland standard instead if it is improved permanent grassland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as Countryside Stewardship, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc" rel="external">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>
  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a> that may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sites of special scientific interest</h4>

<p>If the land is a site of special scientific interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>), it is eligible for this standard, but you’ll need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">consent from Natural England</a>.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement cannot start until Natural England gives this consent. Information about when to request this consent will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h4>Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 3 (add organic matter) on land with peaty soil, as explained later in this section. You’ll still be paid for this area even if you do not complete action 3. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4>Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>How the arable and horticultural soils standard works</h3>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<h4>Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There is an additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 and may include use of no-tillage techniques. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £22 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of land into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £40 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#getting-paid">payments</a>.</p>

<h4>When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, for example, establishing winter cover by the start of December, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h4>Checking the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check the progress of your agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

  <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 50% of land in this level of the standard over winter and multi-species cover crops on an additional 20% of the land</li>
</ul>

<h4>Details of the actions</h4>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
  <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you undertake.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into the standard</li>
  <li>produced a written soil management plan</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard has been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 35 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 35 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
  <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, you must also explain in your annual declaration why you have not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>retested land parcels for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> when existing test results reached 5 years’ old</li>
  <li>completed <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> testing during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land parcels not tested within the last 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to sample and test soil organic matter. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will enable you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.6 </span>Action 3: Add organic matter</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must add organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard to improve soil health. This can be any kind of organic matter. There are examples of how you could add organic matter for this action under ‘How to do it’.</p>

<p>For the introductory level, this can include sown green cover crops established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>For the intermediate level, this can include multi-species green cover established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>If your land has ‘peaty soil’, you should not complete this action on that land because adding organic matter can speed up peat decomposition. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. If there is peaty soil, you should read the guidance about adding soil organic matter that will be published before applications open.</p>

<p>You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you. You’ll still be paid for this area in this standard, even if you cannot complete the action.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must do this on every land parcel entered into this standard at least once during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This could be done as part of your crop rotation.</p>

<p>By the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have added organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>Examples of how you could add organic matter to your soil include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying manure or other organic matter</li>
  <li>using green manures, catch crops or cover crops</li>
  <li>chopping and leaving, or incorporating, straw</li>
  <li>introducing grass or herbal leys into an arable rotation</li>
  <li>including legume species or legume rick mixes in rotations</li>
</ul>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to add organic matter. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that, by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, your soil organic matter levels have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been maintained at a healthy level if this is already the case</li>
  <li>increased to healthy levels</li>
</ul>

<p>This will improve the long-term productivity of your soil, and also brings benefits for soil biodiversity and carbon storage.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.7 </span>Action 4: Winter cover</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>For the introductory level, over winter you must have a well-established green cover on at least 70% of the land entered into this level of the standard. 
Green cover is any crop or vegetation that covers bare soil to protect it over the winter. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>autumn-sown crops such as winter cereals, linseed and oilseed rape</li>
  <li>a quick-growing cover crop</li>
  <li>leaving weedy stubbles that give sufficient cover to protect the soil</li>
</ul>

<p>For the intermediate level, over winter you must have: 
* a well-established green cover on at least 50% of the land entered into this level of the standard 
* multi-species cover crops on at least an additional 20% of the land entered into this level of the standard</p>

<p>Multi-species cover crops are a mix of brassicas, legumes, grasses and cereals, grown together on the same area of land. You can choose the plant types and the proportion of each plant type that works for your farm.</p>

<p>A well-established green cover is where there is leafy vegetation, that’s sufficiently well grown to protect the soil, from the start of December. There should be minimal bare soil. If this is not possible, for example, due to prolonged adverse weather, you must let the RPA know. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#checking-progress">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<p>For both introductory and intermediate levels, you must not leave any land bare over winter if it is at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<p>Existing areas of multi-species cover crops and temporary grassland can be used for this action.</p>

<p>For this action, you can also use areas of green cover or multi-species cover crops on your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses">GAEC 1</a>
</li>
  <li>2-metre cross compliance green cover requirement under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-7a-boundaries">GAEC 7a</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use a quick-growing cover crop as green cover, you do not have to destroy it.</p>

<p>You can graze the winter cover, but there still needs to be a well-established green cover over winter. You should not use or allow grazing to destroy the cover crop in these months.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have a well-established green cover (and multi-species cover at intermediate level) by the start of December.</p>

<p>You must keep the green cover (and multi-species cover) until the end of February, unless you’re establishing an early-sown spring crop.</p>

<p>Where conditions allow, you may destroy both types of cover before the end of February to establish an early-sown spring crop. You must not do this more than 6 weeks before you establish that spring crop.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK on how to establish green cover. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there is a well-established cover across all of the land used for this action over winter.</p>

<p>This will help protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and run-off.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> improved grassland soils standard</h2>

<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the improved grassland soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the improved grassland soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard will improve the environment</h3>

<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the arable and horticultural soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water quality</li>
  <li>climate resilience</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span>Eligible land for the improved grassland soils standard</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into the improved grassland soils standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-your-land-details">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the improved grassland soils standard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arable Land (only if its land type is improved temporary grassland)</li>
  <li>Permanent Grassland (only if its land type is improved permanent grassland)</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard if its land type is improved grassland. This includes both permanent and temporary grassland, as long as it’s improved grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise improved grassland parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>To qualify as improved grassland, the land will have been managed in some or all of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular re-seeding, or has been reseeded within the last 15 years</li>
  <li>regular fertilising with typically at least 100 kg per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of nitrogen as an artificial compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries</li>
  <li>boom spraying herbicide to treat weeds</li>
  <li>active, well-maintained field drains</li>
  <li>taking any conserved forage as silage, haylage or hay, usually more than once a year</li>
</ul>

<p>Improved grassland will usually have a high coverage of ryegrass and white clover.</p>

<p>Permanent grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage, which has not been included in the crop rotation for 5 or more consecutive years. It may have been reseeded during that time.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved grassland and enter it into the improved grassland soils standard</li>
  <li>arable land and enter it into the <a class="govuk-link" href="#arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Unimproved grassland is not eligible for this standard. Unimproved grassland means land that has not been cultivated within the last 15 years. For example, it will not have been cultivated during this 15-year period by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sowing or reseeding</li>
  <li>ploughing, or an activity that breaks the soil surface or disrupts the subsoil</li>
  <li>adding artificial fertiliser or soil improvers</li>
</ul>

<p>This unimproved grassland may be eligible for Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) grassland options. A low and no input grassland standard should be available in <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> from 2024.</p>

<p>Unimproved grassland will usually have a diverse sward made up of a range of grasses and wildflowers.</p>

<p>If you have recently created a species rich sward, for example, under a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you cannot enter that area into this standard. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, the total available area of a land parcel must be improved grassland. If part of a land parcel’s available area includes an ineligible land type for this standard, you must not select that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. It’s not possible for you to reduce the available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, you must not select a land parcel if its total available area is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Permanent Grassland land cover, but only 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved permanent grassland</li>
  <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Arable land cover, but only 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved temporary grassland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland standard on any area with historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You’ll still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc/" rel="external">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>
  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a>, which may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h4>

<p>If the land is an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, it is eligible for this standard. You do not need consent from Natural England to enter <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land into this standard, but you must not complete action 4 at the intermediate level in this standard on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land. You’ll still be paid for this area. This is explained in the details of action 4.</p>

<h4>Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys ) of this standard on land with peaty soil as explained below. You’ll still be paid for this area, even if you do not complete action 4. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4>Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard works</h3>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard, where this is the case.</p>

<h4>Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There’s one additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 onwards. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
      <td>£58 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>

<h4>When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h4>Checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Details of the actions</h4>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the improved grassland soils standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.6 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
  <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you do.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not need to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into this standard</li>
  <li>produced a written soil management plan for that land</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.7 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard have been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity to meet this timing, you should try to make sure the tests are done as soon as possible. You must make sure that all these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If you do this, you must explain in your annual declaration why you have not tested these land parcels for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> results reached 5 years old</li>
  <li>during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, if completing the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> testing for the first time</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to sample and test soil organic matter. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels entered into this standard within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.8 </span>Action 3: Minimise bare ground over winter</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure that no more than 5% of the total area of land entered into the standard is left bare, or becomes bare, over winter.</p>

<p>Bare land is any area of land where the soil is not covered by vegetation and is directly exposed to the elements.</p>

<p>You must not leave any land bare over winter if it’s at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have no more than 5% of the land entered into this standard as bare ground from the start of December until the end of February.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. Methods you could use to avoid bare ground include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-seeding grassland early enough to ensure it’s established</li>
  <li>preventing livestock poaching wet ground</li>
  <li>avoiding localised poaching around gateways and when supplementary feeding livestock</li>
</ul>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how you might do this. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there’s minimal bare ground across all of the land entered into this standard over winter.</p>

<p>This will help to protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and runoff.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.9 </span>Action 4: Establish or maintain herbal leys</h3>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>For the intermediate level only, you must establish and maintain herbal leys with a mixture of grasses, legumes, herbs and wildflowers on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard. You can maintain an existing herbal ley to meet this.</p>

<p>For this action, you can also use herbal leys located on your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses">GAEC 1</a>
</li>
  <li>2-metre cross compliance green cover requirement under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-7a-boundaries">GAEC 7a</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do this on a single area of land for the duration of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Alternatively, you can move the area used for the herbal leys around the land parcels entered into this standard each year.</p>

<p>You must not establish herbal leys on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any area that’s a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>any area with historic or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not complete this action on any area of ‘peaty soil’. Peaty soil means there’s around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you.</p>

<p>You’ll still be paid for this area, even though you cannot complete the action on it.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must establish the herbal ley in the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If you’ve already established a herbal ley, you can maintain it to meet this action.</p>

<p>You must maintain the herbal ley on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You can choose what mix of grasses, legumes, herbs and wildflowers to use in the herbal ley.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to establish and maintain herbal leys. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there is a sward with a mix of grasses, legumes, herbs and wildflowers on at least 15% of the land entered into this standard.</p>

<p>This will provide varied root structures to improve and maintain the soil’s structure, carbon, biology and fertility.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> moorland standard</h2>
<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the moorland standard.</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement. The rest of the information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the moorland standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>How the moorland standard will improve the environment</h3>

<p>Moorland soils and habitats provide a range of benefits to the public (public goods). These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carbon storage, to offset the effects of climate change</li>
  <li>water storage and flow, to reduce the effects of flooding and drought</li>
  <li>biodiversity, to protect plants and wildlife</li>
  <li>heritage, to protect historic and archaeological features</li>
</ul>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard is focused on assessing moorland to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which of these benefits the moorland already provides</li>
  <li>opportunities to maintain or enhance these benefits</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>Eligible land for the moorland standard</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into the moorland standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel outside a common on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. However, common land is not currently shown on your digital maps. The RPA is looking at how these land details, including land cover, can be shared with you to help you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land. More information will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<p>Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligible-land-covers-and-land-types">which land covers are eligible for the moorland standard</a>.</p>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of the land covers that are eligible for this standard, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into this standard if its land type is moorland. This means it’s located above the moorland line.</p>

<p>You can check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?chosenLayers=moorIndex,backdropDIndex,backdropIndex,europeIndex,vmlBWIndex,25kBWIndex,50kBWIndex,250kBWIndex,miniscaleBWIndex,baseIndex&amp;box=-1037291:0:1837291:1400000&amp;useDefaultbackgroundMapping=false" rel="external">MAGIC</a> to find out if your land is above the moorland line.</p>

<p>The vegetation of these moorland areas will usually be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>semi-natural moorland habitats including heathland, blanket bog, rough acid grasslands, rushy flushes, swamps, mires and bracken</li>
  <li>upland calcareous grassland</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel is on both sides of the moorland line:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the majority of the land parcel’s area is above the moorland line, you can enter the total area of that land parcel into the moorland standard</li>
  <li>where the majority of the land parcel’s area is below the moorland line, the whole of that land parcel is not eligible for the moorland standard, but may be eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="#arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standards</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some areas of land located above the moorland line that you cannot enter into this standard. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable land</li>
  <li>farmyards</li>
  <li>permanent crops</li>
  <li>areas used for turf or peat production</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of upland moorland is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered common land, with land owned by one of more parties and rights held by multiple commoners</li>
  <li>shared grazing where graziers have a legal right to graze but the land is not registered as common land</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span>Other land eligibility schemes to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h5>Other schemes and funding sources</h5>

<p>Land is eligible for this standard if it’s receiving Farming in Protected Landscapes (FIPL) funding or it’s in an existing scheme such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This land is eligible because the introductory level of this standard only includes actions not already in FIPL, <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>. This means you’re not being paid twice for a similar activity on the same area of land at the same time (known as ‘double funding’).</p>

<h5>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h5>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish or maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland standard on any area with historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You’ll still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>)I. You’ll then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc" rel="external">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>
  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a> which may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h5>

<p>If the land is an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, it is eligible for this standard without getting consent from Natural England. You will not have to undertake <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> prohibited activities on the land to complete the actions in this standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span>How the moorland standard works</h3>

<p>The moorland standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the moorland standard, it cannot be selected for the other of the 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<h4>Different levels</h4>

<p>The moorland standard only has an introductory level. This level is focused on actions not already in <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>, with actions to assess the moorland and produce plans. <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> will continue to fund physical actions. This means you can combine <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> to provide an income source.</p>

<p>The introductory level of this standard will work alongside other schemes until 2024. There are a range of options available in <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> for moorland areas, as well as other funding sources, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-farmers-in-protected-landscapes">Farming in Protected Landscapes</a>.</p>

<p>Intermediate and advanced levels of this standard will be added in the future. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>

<h4>When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard, as explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<h4>Checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.5 </span>Summary of the actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>action 1: identify and record the soil and vegetation types and condition, and presence of historic and archaeological features</li>
  <li>action 2: assess the public goods the moorland is already providing</li>
  <li>action 3: identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided by the moorland</li>
</ul>

<h4>Details of the actions</h4>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the moorland standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.6 </span>Action 1: Survey the soil, vegetation, historic and archaeological features</h3>

<p>You must carry out a survey to identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features across the moorland area entered into this standard.</p>

<p>To do this, you must divide the moorland area into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and select a sample point within each block that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is broadly representative of the main vegetation and soil types of the block</li>
  <li>can be accessed and surveyed safely</li>
</ul>

<p>For each sample point, you must identify, assess and record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>soil types and condition, including the depth and wetness of any peat</li>
  <li>vegetation types and condition, including their height and structure</li>
  <li>the extent of bare ground</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also record the presence of historic and archaeological features. These will be identified on the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> you request before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>You cannot use an existing survey to meet this action.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>In the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement you must identify, assess and record the required information for one sample in each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block, across all the land entered into this standard.</p>

<p>In each subsequent year of your agreement, you must repeat this survey at a different sample point within each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block. Try to do this at about the same time each year.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action, but the survey must sample blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and record the information explained in ‘What to do’.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to use a map to define your 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks across the moorland entered into this standard.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to do this action. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve the action’s aim. The aim is for you to have recorded, across the moorland entered into this standard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the soil types and their condition</li>
  <li>the vegetation types and their condition</li>
  <li>the presence of historic and archaeological features</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you assess how your moorland contributes to providing public goods and identify opportunities to maintain and enhance them.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your survey. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.7 </span>Action 2: Identify public goods the moorland provides</h3>

<p>You must use the information you’ve collected for action 1 to identify and record public goods your moorland is providing. These public goods include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carbon storage</li>
  <li>water storage and flow</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
  <li>heritage</li>
</ul>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must use the survey of your moorland for action 1 to identify and record the public goods it provides. You must do this in the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In subsequent years of your agreement, you must review this record and update it where required, based on further surveys completed for action 1.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to do this action. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is for you to have assessed and recorded how the moorland entered into this standard is already providing public goods.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a written record of the public goods you’ve identified as already being provided by the moorland. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.8 </span>Action 3: Identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides</h3>

<p>You must use the information collected for actions 1 and 2 to identify and record opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>In the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must use the information collected for actions 1 and 2 to produce a record of opportunities to maintain and enhance the public goods your moorland provides.</p>

<p>In subsequent years of your agreement, you must review this record and update it where required, based on further information collected under actions 1 and 2.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>Before applications open, we’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about how to do this action. You may find it helpful to read this guidance, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can use this guidance, along with your survey results and assessments from actions 1 and 2, to help you identify and record opportunities to enhance the public goods provided by your moorland. These may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhancing wildlife habitats</li>
  <li>increasing carbon storage</li>
  <li>improving the potential for water storage and slowing water flow</li>
  <li>protecting and enhancing historic and archaeological features</li>
  <li>identifying possible areas of woodland expansion and drainage intervention</li>
</ul>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard focuses on mapping and identifying opportunities to maintain and enhance the public benefits your moorland provides. In future, we expect that there will be funding available to help you carry out activities that maintain and enhance the public benefits provided by your moorland.</p>

<p>These activities are likely to be funded when intermediate and advanced levels are added to the moorland standard. Once these higher levels are available, you should not expect to remain in the introductory level for more than 3 years before upgrading to these higher levels.</p>

<p>You may also be able to apply to other funding sources to support these activities, including private sector schemes.</p>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is for you to have identified and recorded how you can maintain or enhance the public goods provided by the moorland entered into this standard.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a written record of the opportunities you’ve identified to maintain or enhance public goods provided by your moorland. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review</h2>
<p>The annual health and welfare review is part of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) offer in 2022.</p>

<p>We will start testing the first annual health and welfare reviews in summer 2022, and we’ll steadily increase these by invitation over the summer before opening to eligible keepers in autumn 2022.</p>

<p>Later this year, we will publish more information on GOV.UK about when applications will open and how to apply. This funding will be available for three years, after which we will review the situation.</p>

<p>Livestock keepers can get funding for a vet or vet-led team of your choice to visit your farm and carry out an annual review of your eligible livestock.  </p>

<p>The review sits alongside the environmental land management standards. You do not need to have an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to be eligible to apply for the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review. </p>

<p>This review is designed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce endemic diseases such as bovine viral disease (<abbr title="bovine viral disease">BVD</abbr>) in cattle, porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (<abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr>) in pigs and resistance to parasite treatments in sheep</li>
  <li>improve the welfare of your animals</li>
  <li>increase productivity</li>
  <li>ensure your use of veterinary medicines and vaccines is appropriate</li>
  <li>be primarily for the farmer, and not used for inspections or compliance</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your eligibility to apply for this funding</h4>

<p>To be eligible to apply for funding under the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review, your business, the Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) that’s applying, must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>). This means the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> must have at least 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land and 5 or more <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements on 16 May 2022.</p>

<p>The review will be made available to those not currently eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> as soon as possible, so a wider range of livestock keepers can apply for this funding.</p>

<p>If you meet this <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility requirement, you can apply for the annual health and welfare review if you’re a livestock keeper with more than any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 cattle</li>
  <li>20 sheep</li>
  <li>50 pigs</li>
</ul>

<p>These livestock must be registered in England.</p>

<p>If you have more than one species of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, and the number of livestock in each species exceeds the minimum threshold, you can have one review annually for each species.</p>

<p>If the livestock are kept at different geographical locations, you may be eligible for more than one annual review. More information about how this will work will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h4>How much funding you can apply for</h4>

<p>There is a payment for each species. It is not a payment for each animal.</p>

<p>This payment will help you cover the costs for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vet</li>
  <li>testing for endemic diseases and conditions</li>
  <li>your time</li>
</ul>

<p>The payment for each species is different. This is because the required testing for some species may take longer to do, and some results cost more to analyse.</p>

<p>You’ll be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
  <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
  <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
  <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
</ul>

<h4>What the review will include</h4>

<p>The review will require:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 to 3 hours of a vet and farmer’s time, looking at health and welfare in a way that meets the farmer’s and vet’s priorities for the farm</li>
  <li>a written report prepared by the vet with agreed recommendations and actions to improve the livestock’s health and welfare</li>
  <li>testing to industry standards for a priority endemic disease or condition, depending on species including <abbr title="bovine viral disease">BVD</abbr> in cattle, <abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr> in pigs or to find out how effective the anthelmintic being used is in sheep</li>
  <li>the vet sharing some information relevant to the health and welfare of the farmer’s livestock, including test results, with us</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional areas may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a check of your biosecurity measures and advice on improving them</li>
  <li>recommendations about medicines used on your farm including antibiotics and vaccinations </li>
  <li>advice on grants and sources of funding available</li>
</ul>

<h4>How the review will be completed by the vet</h4>

<p>It is expected that each review will take between 2 to 3 hours of your, and the vet’s, time. This does not include the time taken to carry out the required testing for endemic diseases and conditions.</p>

<p>As part of the review, the vet will discuss with you your test results, and recommend actions you can take to improve health and welfare based on testing and their time on the farm.</p>

<h4>What happens after the review</h4>

<p>Once the vet has completed the review, they will provide you with a report that includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the agreed priority recommendations and actions for you to improve the health and welfare of your livestock</li>
  <li>advice about how you can monitor your livestock in future to identify how things are changing throughout the year</li>
  <li>advice about how you can record data as part of the review</li>
  <li>information about where you can find further support</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will not be shared with us or used for any regulatory or site visit purposes.</p>

<p>The vet, or one of their team, will record some information about the review, including test results online. This information will be anonymised and stored securely. It will give us a better understanding of the health and welfare of the national herds and flock. It will not be used for site visits or other compliance checks.</p>

<p>We will publish more information on GOV.UK later this year about when applications will open and how to apply.</p>
