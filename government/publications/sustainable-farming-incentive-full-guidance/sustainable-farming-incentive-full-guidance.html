<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>A summary of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> in 2022</h2>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) is the first of 3 new environmental schemes being introduced under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agricultural-transition-plan-2021-to-2024">Agricultural Transition Plan</a>. The other 2 schemes are Local Nature Recovery and Landscape Recovery.</p>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> aims to help farmers manage land in a way that improves food production and is more environmentally sustainable.</p>

<p>Farmers will be paid to provide public goods, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved water quality</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
  <li>climate change mitigation</li>
  <li>animal health and welfare</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2022, <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encourage actions that improve soil health</li>
  <li>recognise how moorland provides benefits to the public (public goods)</li>
  <li>improve animal health and welfare by helping farmers with the costs of veterinary advice for livestock</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>
<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements</h3>

<p>You’ll be eligible to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you’re a farmer who is eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), with land in England. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">eligibility for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<h4>Standards</h4>
<p>In 2022, there will be 3 standards available, with different levels and payments. Those are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Standard</th>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arable and horticultural soils</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£22 per hectare</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
      <td>£40 per hectare</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Improved grassland soils</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£28 per hectare</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
      <td>£58 per hectare</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Moorland</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£10.30 per hectare</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Additional payment</td>
      <td>£265 per agreement</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There will also be an additional annual payment of £6.15 per hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) for common land entered into a separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In the future, more standards will be introduced. You’ll be able to add these to your agreement, as well as increase levels and add land.</p>

<p>Read guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-the-sfi-standards-work">how <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards work</a>.</p>

<h4>Agreements</h4>
<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement will last for 3 years. You need to have ‘management control’ of the land entered into the agreement for its 3-year duration. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">eligibility</a> for more details about ‘management control’.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>You’ll be paid on a quarterly basis, with the first payment usually made mid-way through the 4th month after your agreement starts.</p>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#getting-paid">getting paid for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<h4>Applying for an agreement</h4>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> applications opened for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers from 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>Applications will remain open, so you can apply at a time that works best for you. If it’s necessary to close applications, this date will be publicised, including on GOV.UK, giving you 6 weeks’ notice.</p>

<p>Our new <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application service is designed to be quicker and more straightforward for farmers. The service includes some new functionality that allows us to automate the checks we need to do and process applications to offer agreements much more quickly than we’ve previously been able to do. This means you should usually receive your agreement offer within 2 months of submitting your application and in many cases more quickly than that.</p>

<p>We’re rolling out the new functionality during July in a controlled way, so we can make sure we’re able to offer everyone the right level of service and support during this initial phase. This includes carrying out some extra checks and monitoring in the background to make sure everything runs smoothly for every farmer as we bring more people into the service. This means that while all <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers can apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, during the first few weeks of rollout there will be different ways into the application service for different groups of farmers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers who do not have an existing agri-environment agreement can sign into the Rural Payments service now to apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on eligible land outside a common.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks of rollout, <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers who have an existing agri-environment agreement, or who want to apply on common land, need to contact us. We’ll then arrange for them to start their online application in the Rural Payments service as soon as possible. We will be allowing farmers access to the service in a controlled way over this initial period, so we may ask you to wait for a couple of weeks before progressing your online application.</p>

<p>In this case, you can either email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a> (using ‘Apply early for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>’ as the email subject and including your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) or call us on 03000 200 301 (Monday to Friday 8.30am to 5pm, except bank holidays). We will respond to these requests as quickly as possible, and in most cases within 2 weeks.</p>

<p>We expect that most <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers should be able to apply directly online in the Rural Payments service by the end of August, without needing RPA assistance or intervention.</p>

<p>For more information, read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-online-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-on-land-outside-a-common">how to apply online for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on land outside a common</a>.</p>

<p>If you cannot apply online because you do not have access to the internet or a computer, call us on 03000 200 301 (Monday to Friday, 8.30am to 5pm, except bank holidays).</p>

<h4>Capital items funding</h4>

<p>The standards will not include any capital items funding in 2022. You can apply for existing capital items funding offers on land parcels entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-capital-grants-manual">Countryside Stewardship capital grants</a>.</p>

<p>In the future, <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> will include capital items funding to help you complete the actions in the standards. More details about this will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Annual health and welfare review</h3>

<p>The annual health and welfare review will provide funding to eligible livestock farmers. This funding will cover the cost of an annual review of your livestock by a vet chosen by you.</p>

<p>This is part of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> offer in 2022 and sits alongside the environmental standards. You do not need to have an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to be eligible to apply for the annual health and welfare review funding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What to do before you apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>

<p>This information explains when you’ll be able to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, how to apply and what you need to do before starting your application.</p>

<h4>Applying for an agreement</h4>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> applications opened for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers from 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>Applications will remain open, so you can apply at a time that works best for you. If it’s necessary to close applications, this date will be publicised, including on GOV.UK, giving you 6 weeks’ notice.</p>

<p>Our new <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application service is designed to be quicker and more straightforward for farmers. The service includes some new functionality that allows us to automate the checks we need to do and process applications to offer agreements much more quickly than we’ve previously been able to do. This means you should usually receive your agreement offer within 2 months of submitting your application and in many cases more quickly than that.</p>

<p>We’re rolling out the new functionality during July in a controlled way, so we can make sure we’re able to offer everyone the right level of service and support during this initial phase. This includes carrying out some extra checks and monitoring in the background to make sure everything runs smoothly for every farmer as we bring more people into the service. This means that while all <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers can apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, during the first few weeks of rollout there will be different ways into the application service for different groups of farmers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers who do not have an existing agri-environment agreement can sign into the Rural Payments service now to apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on eligible land outside a common.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks of rollout, <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers who have an existing agri-environment agreement, or who want to apply on common land, need to contact us. We’ll then arrange for them to start their online application in the Rural Payments service as soon as possible. We will be allowing farmers access to the service in a controlled way over this initial period, so we may ask you to wait for a couple of weeks before progressing your online application.</p>

<p>In this case, you can either email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a> (using ‘Apply early for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>’ as the email subject and including your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) or call us on 03000 200 301 (Monday to Friday 8.30am to 5pm, except bank holidays).

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Check your land details before you apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>The same land details shown on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a> are used for several land-based schemes, including the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) and the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>). </p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>What land details are shown on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application</h3>

<p>When you apply online for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>, you’ll see:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Check your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Before you apply, you need to check your digital maps are up to date. For each land parcel you’ll be including in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s linked to your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) </li>
  <li>the land cover correctly reflects the use of the land parcel </li>
  <li>the permanent boundaries are correct</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-your-land-details">update your land details</a> if this information is not up to date.</p>

<h4>How to view your digital maps </h4>

<p>To view your digital maps, sign into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. From your ‘Business overview’ screen, select ‘Land’ and ‘View land’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Common land is not shown on your digital maps. You can check the maps we have previously provided to you to check the land cover on the common land. When you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land, you’ll be able to view the land parcels on a digital map as part of the application process.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible farmers can apply separately on common land, we’ll publish information to help you apply.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>What land is eligible for an agreement</h3>

<p>The land you enter into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement must be eligible for the standard selected. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible land type</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is and are shown on your digital maps.</p>

<p>The land cover is not the same as the land use you declare in your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. The land use describes the activities you’re using the land cover for. It is not shown on your digital maps. </p>

<p>A land parcel’s registered land cover must be compatible with the land use you declare for that land parcel in your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. For example, if the land use is temporary grassland, the registered land cover must be ‘Arable land’.</p>

<p>There are 4 land cover categories shown on your digital maps. These are listed here, with some examples of land uses declared in <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> applications for each land cover category.</p>

<p>Certain identified land covers are eligible for each standard.</p>

<p>The ‘available area’ for each land parcel is shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This is based on the land cover currently registered that’s eligible for the standard you’ve chosen. When you select a land parcel, its total available area is included. You cannot reduce this available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, for example, if only part of the available area is eligible for the standard you choose. For more information about how the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> available area is automatically calculated, read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-online-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-on-land-outside-a-common">how to apply online for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on land outside a common</a>.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of the broad category of land cover, for example different types of grassland or arable crop types.</p>

<p>A land parcel with an eligible land cover for the standard you choose must also be a land type that’s eligible for that standard. This means its total ‘available area’ shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application must be an eligible land type.</p>

<p>You can only include a land parcel’s total ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>If only part of the ‘available area’ in a land parcel is an eligible land type for the standard you’ve chosen, you cannot reduce its available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. In this case, you must not include that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel with a Permanent Grassland land cover and you choose the improved grassland soils standard, the total ‘available area’ based on the eligible land cover is 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>. If the land type is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved permanent grassland for the whole 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you can enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
  <li>improved permanent grassland for only 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you must not enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example would be if you have an 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> land parcel with an arable land cover. If you choose the improved grassland soils standard, the total ‘available area’ is 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>. If the land type is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved temporary grassland for the whole 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you can enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
  <li>improved temporary grassland for only 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>, you must not enter this land parcel into this standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The eligible type of land for each standard is explained in the guidance for the individual standards (under ‘Eligible land’).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>How to update your land details </h3>

<p>When you update a land parcel’s details on your digital maps, this affects all the land-based schemes that land parcel is used for. This includes <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>, <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>This is important to consider if you’re updating the land cover to enter a land parcel into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The land cover must be compatible with the land use declared on your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. If it’s not, that will affect your <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application. </p>

<h4>RLE1 form and guidance</h4>
<p>You’ll usually need to use an RLE1 form and sketch maps to update your land details. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use/">Read the RLE1 guidance</a> for more information about completing the RLE1 form and sketch maps. </p>

<p>Submit the RLE1 form and sketch maps to the RPA. You need to wait for your land details to be updated on your digital maps before continuing with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Step 1: Your land</h3>

<h4>Check and confirm your land details</h4>

<p>If your land details aren’t up to date, this will affect which land parcels you can select for the standards later in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>You will only be able to select land parcels that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are linked to your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have an eligible land cover for the standard you select - read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-land-details-before-you-apply-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement#eligible-land-covers-and-land-types-for-the-sfi-standards">eligible land covers</a> in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> scheme information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before continuing with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, check that the details for the land parcels you will be entering into the standard(s) are up to date. Do this on your digital maps using the Land Viewer.</p>

<p>If the land details are up to date, select ‘Yes, my land details are correct’ and then ‘Continue’.</p>

<p>If the land details need to be updated, select ‘No, I need to update my land details’. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-land-details-before-you-apply-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement#how-to-update-your-land-details">how to update your land details</a>. You should not continue with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application until we confirm that we have updated your land details.</p>

<h4>Confirm you will have management control of the land</h4>

<p>You must have ‘management control’ of the land parcels you select later in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application to enter into the standards for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> agreement. If you will not have management control, you must not include that land in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement#management-control-of-land">management control</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Step 2: Select your standards</h3>

<p>You’ll see the standards you can apply for based on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-land-details-before-you-apply-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement#eligible-land-covers-and-land-types-for-the-sfi-standards">eligible land covers</a> currently registered for the land parcels linked to your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Select all of the available standards you want to apply for by ticking the relevant boxes. You will then select eligible land parcels for each standard later in your application.</p>

<p>Select ‘Continue’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Step 3: Choose the level of actions you agree to do</h3>

<h4>Choose the level of actions you agree to do</h4>

<p>You have to answer questions to confirm the actions you will do on the land entered into the standard(s). This will determine if you are eligible to enter land into the introductory or intermediate levels.</p>

<p>If you have chosen more than one standard, you will need to answer the relevant questions for the actions in each standard.</p>

<p>Find out about the actions for the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-moorland-standard">moorland standard</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For each of the two soils standards, you must answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the questions for the actions in the introductory level, then select ‘Continue’</li>
  <li>the question for the additional action in the intermediate level, then select ‘Continue’</li>
</ul>

<p>How you answer the intermediate level question will impact what levels you’ll see when asked to select the available land parcels to enter into the standard. If you choose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Yes’, you’ll see both the introductory and the intermediate levels, but you can still select the introductory level for all the land parcels if you decide you don’t want to do the intermediate level action</li>
  <li>‘No’, you’ll only see the introductory level</li>
</ul>

<p>For the moorland standard, you must answer the questions for the introductory level.</p>

<h4>Select available land parcels for this standard</h4>

<p>You’ll see the available land parcels for the first standard you have selected. Once you have selected land parcels to enter into that standard, you’ll do the same for any other standard(s) you have selected.</p>

<h4>How to view your available land parcels</h4>

<p>Your available land parcels for the standard are grouped together by the relevant Ordnance Survey (OS) Map Sheet Reference(s). These references are shown with two letters (for example, SY) and a number (for example, 6). This is how OS records mapping data.</p>

<p>To view the land parcels, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select the OS Map Sheet Reference link from the list</li>
  <li>select the OS Map Sheet Reference on the map</li>
</ul>

<p>You will then select a land parcel and level for the standard as explained below.</p>

<p>Once you have selected land parcels under an OS Map Sheet Reference, you will be able to view and select the land parcels under another OS Map Sheet Reference, where relevant.</p>

<h4>How a land parcel’s available area is calculated</h4>

<p>When you select a level for a land parcel, you will see its <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> ‘available area’. This is not the same as the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible area.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> available area for each land parcel is automatically calculated by taking its total area and deducting the following areas, where relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ineligible land cover(s) for the standard</li>
  <li>ineligible Countryside Stewardship revenue options</li>
  <li>ineligible Environmental Stewardship revenue options</li>
  <li>any land already in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> pilot agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>If we’ve automatically deducted any of the areas above, you will see a message immediately below the affected land parcel telling you why the available area has been reduced.</p>

<p>You must make sure that the total available area for the land parcel is also an eligible land type for the standard. For example, the whole available area must be improved grassland for the improved grassland soils standard. If only part of the available area is improved grassland, you cannot reduce its available area in your application so you must not select that land parcel. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-land-details-before-you-apply-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement#eligible-land-covers-and-land-types-for-the-sfi-standards">eligible land covers and land types for each standard</a>.</p>

<h4>Select the level(s) in the standard for the available land parcels</h4>

<p>You can now select the level in the standard for each land parcel under the relevant OS Map Sheet Reference.</p>

<p>The level(s) you see will depend on the answers you gave for the actions earlier in Step 3. For the soils standards, if you have answered ‘Yes’ to the intermediate level question, you’ll see both the introductory and intermediate levels.</p>

<p>To select all the available land parcels for a level, choose ‘Select all’ in the box under the relevant level.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can select a level for each available land parcel. You can do this by ticking the relevant box for the level next to the land parcel, or select it on the map by clicking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>once for the introductory level</li>
  <li>again for the intermediate level</li>
  <li>again to deselect it</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have selected the level for the available land parcels under that OS Sheet Reference, select ‘Add to application’. You can then select available land parcels and levels under another OS Map Sheet Reference.</p>

<p>After you have selected all the land parcels and level(s) for that standard, select ‘Confirm selection’ to see ‘Your payment value summary for this standard’.</p>

<p>Select ‘Continue’ to return to the ‘Apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>’ screen. If you selected another standard at Step 2, you now need to complete Step 3 for that standard.</p>

<h4>Selecting a land parcel for a different standard</h4>

<p>If a land parcel has a ‘land cover’ that’s eligible for more than one standard, you can only select it for one standard. For example, an improved temporary grassland land parcel with an ‘Arable’ land cover could be eligible for either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
  <li>the improved grassland soils standard</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have already selected this land parcel for the arable and horticultural soils standard but have now decided to enter it into the improved grassland soils standard instead. In this case, you can still select this land parcel for the improved grassland soils standard, but you will see a warning message to say it’s available but is already in another standard. You will need to confirm that you want to select the land parcel for the improved grassland soils standard instead.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>Step 4: Review and submit your application</h3>

<h4>Check your answers</h4>

<p>Once you have completed Step 3) for all the standards you want to apply for, you need to ‘Check your answers’ and if you believe the information shown is correct, select ‘Continue’. This will return you to the ‘Apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>’ screen.</p>

<h4>Submit your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application</h4>

<p>Select ‘Submit your application’. Make sure you read the declaration on this screen. If you agree with that, select ‘I agree - submit my application’.</p>

<p>Once you submit your application, you cannot amend it. You can only withdraw it and start again.</p>

<p>After you have submitted your application, you can view your ‘application summary’ PDF which shows what you have applied for. You may want to print or save this application summary and keep it for your records.</p>

<p>We’ll tell you when your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement offer is available in the Rural Payments service for you to review. You can only accept or reject it. You cannot request changes to it. To find out how to accept or reject your agreement offer, read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-a-sfi-standards-agreement-works">how to review your agreement offer</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Check you and your land are eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>

<p>To enter into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement, both you and your land must be eligible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Your eligibility to apply for an agreement</h3>

<p>To be eligible to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement in 2022 your business, the Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) that’s applying for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>). This means the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> must have at least 5 hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land and 5 or more <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements on 16 May 2022.</p>

<p>The 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land does not set a minimum eligible area for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as there is no minimum area.</p>

<p>Your business does not need to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 or to have received <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the past. This rule is simply to limit applicants to those who are eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>. This requirement will be removed in later years, so a wider range of farmers can apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, but that’s unlikely to happen before 2024.</p>

<p>If you apply for a separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land or an area of shared grazing, this <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule works differently. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#commons-and-shared-grazing-land">common land and shared grazing</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Your land’s eligibility</h3>

<p>A land parcel is eligible to be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is wholly located in England</li>
  <li>its registered land cover (shown on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service) and its land type are eligible for the standards you choose</li>
  <li>you will have management control of the land for the duration of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose which eligible land parcels to enter. You do not have to include all of your land parcels and there is no minimum or maximum area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Eligible land cover and type of land</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement that’s eligible for the standard you choose. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible land type</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>
<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is. There are 4 categories of land cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable land</li>
  <li>permanent grassland</li>
  <li>permanent crops</li>
  <li>other (non-agricultural)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel outside a common on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a>.</p>

<p>Common land is not shown on your digital maps. You can check the maps we have previously provided to you to check the land cover on the common land. When you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land, you will be able to view the land parcels on a digital map as part of the application process. Before applications open, we’ll publish information on GOV.UK to help you apply on common land.</p>

<p>Certain identified land covers are eligible for each standard. You can find out which land covers are eligible for each of the standards in each of the standards.</p>

<p>The ‘available area’ for each land parcel is shown in your&nbsp;<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;application. This is based on the land cover currently registered that’s eligible for the standard you have chosen. When you select a land parcel, its total available area is included in your&nbsp;<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;application. You cannot reduce this available area in your application.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose the arable and horticultural soils standard and select a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel that has 8&nbsp;<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>&nbsp;of Arable land cover and 2&nbsp;<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>&nbsp;of ‘Other’ non-agricultural woodland land cover, the available area for this standard is 8&nbsp;<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>. You can only include this 8&nbsp;<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>&nbsp;in your&nbsp;<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;application. You cannot reduce it to 7&nbsp;<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</p>

<p>For more information about how the available area is automatically calculated, read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-online-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-on-land-outside-a-common">how to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on land outside a common</a>.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of the broad category of land cover. For example, different types of grassland or arable crop types.</p>

<p>A land parcel with an eligible land cover for the standard you choose must also be a land type that’s eligible for that standard. This means its total ‘available area’ shown in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application must be an eligible land type.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose the improved grassland soils standard, the land parcel must be improved grassland.</p>

<p>This is explained under ‘Eligible land’ in the information on each standard. You can also read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">eligible land covers and land types</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Management control of land</h3>

<p>To enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement you must have management control of that land for the 3-year duration of the agreement.</p>

<p>You will have management control if you have sufficient control over how the land is managed to complete the actions in the standards chosen, for the duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This will usually mean you’re the person actively farming the land who is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the owner occupier, farming the land yourself or employing a contractor</li>
  <li>a tenant with a Farm Business Tenancy (FBT) under the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, or an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy</li>
  <li>in a group that farms on common land (including areas of shared grazing)</li>
</ul>

<p>When you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you declare that you will have management control of that land for the agreement’s 3-year duration. You must supply evidence to show this if we ask for it.</p>

<p>The following information explains what management control means for tenants, licensors and commoners.</p>

<h4>Management control of tenanted land</h4>

<p>Only a tenant can enter land occupied under a tenancy into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is because they’re the person actively farming the land, not the landlord.</p>

<p>As a tenant, it’s your responsibility to check whether your tenancy agreement allows you to complete the actions in the standards you select.</p>

<p>If you occupy land under a tenancy on a ‘rolling’ year-by-year basis, you can only enter this land into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you expect to have management control of that land for its 3-year duration. For example, this may be the case if you occupy land under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an FBT granted for a term of more than 2 years, that continues on a rolling year-by-year basis after its initial term ends</li>
  <li>an FBT granted for a term of 2 years or less that you expect your landlord to renew on an annual basis</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not enter land into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you do not expect to have management control of that land for its 3-year duration.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure whether you will have management control of the land occupied under a tenancy for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you should check with your landlord.</p>

<p>If you unexpectedly lose management control of the land occupied under a tenancy during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must tell us as soon as reasonably practicable. We will remove that land from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If your loss of management control was because of a change of circumstances, you may not have to repay payments already received.</p>

<p>For more information, read about <a class="govuk-link" href="#checking-progress">what happens if you cannot deliver your agreement, or your circumstances change</a>.</p>

<h4>Management control of land you access under a licence</h4>

<p>If you only have access to land under a licence arrangement (so you’re a licensee), it’s unlikely you have sufficient management control of that land to complete the actions in the standards.</p>

<p>In this case, the licensor (usually the owner occupier) could enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and make the licensee aware of its requirements, if relevant.</p>

<p>If in practice your arrangement with the landowner gives you wider land management responsibilities, similar to those of a tenant, you may be able to enter this land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. For example, some licences on Ministry of Defence land operate in this way. If this applies, you should refer to the information on tenanted land above.</p>

<h4>Management control on commons and shared grazing land</h4>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as Countryside Stewardship, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you and your land are eligible for each scheme</li>
  <li>the activities you’re being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>you are not being paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as ‘double funding’)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-regulatory-issues-and-consents">regulatory issues and consents</a> to find out how to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h4>

<p>Land designated as an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> is eligible for the standards available in 2022, but you may need consent from Natural England. This depends on which standard you’re applying for.</p>

<p>You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations requiring Natural England consent (ORNEC) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land. You are responsible for making sure that you have complied with the consenting requirements set out in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 before you carry out any operations. If you don’t, you may be committing an offence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Eligibility of commons and shared grazing land for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>This information explains the eligibility requirements for common land or an area of shared grazing to be entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement.</p>

<p>You should read this information with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sustainable-farming-incentive-guidance">other Sustainable Farming Incentive standards information</a> which applies to all <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements.</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this information if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you don’t have to follow it.</p>

<p>This information will be kept under review as <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Definition of common land and shared grazing</h3>

<p>For the purposes of an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, ‘common land’ means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>land registered as common land in a register of common land kept under Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006</li>
  <li>land to which Part 1 of that Act does not apply and which is subject to rights of common within the meaning of that Act</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Shared grazing’ means communal pasture that isn’t registered as common land where graziers have a legal entitlement to graze. For example, a pasture used jointly by tenants.</p>

<p>The following information about commons also applies to areas of shared grazing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Applying for an agreement on common land</h3>

<p>You must enter common land or an area of shared grazing into its own <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The agreement cannot include other land you own or rent that is not common land.</p>

<p>This means that you must submit separate applications in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the common land and shared grazing, using the existing single entity’s Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) or a new <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> if a single entity needs to be set up</li>
  <li>land you own or rent that is not common land, using the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> for your own business</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Eligibility to enter common land into an agreement</h3>

<p>To enter common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) eligibility rule</li>
  <li>be a single entity, either as a sole beneficiary or a group</li>
  <li>have a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement for a group</li>
  <li>have sufficient management control of the common land to complete the actions for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>The following information gives more information about each of these requirements.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule</h4>

<p>You must be eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> to apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement in 2022.</p>

<p>For common land, the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility rule is met if one or more people were eligible to use the common to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2021 or 2022. They don’t need to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in 2022 or to have received <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payments in the past.</p>

<h4>Only a ‘single entity’ can apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on commons</h4>

<p>Only a ‘single entity’ can enter into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on a common. This is to make sure that, where there is a group, the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement can be delivered by the single entity for the agreement’s 3-year duration.</p>

<p>A single entity can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a person who will be the sole beneficiary</li>
  <li>a group of two or more people with a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement between them, a nominated representative and a single bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>A sole beneficiary will usually be a landowner who owns the whole common and has sole use and rights to the common.</p>

<p>A common may already have a single entity to oversee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an existing Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) or Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>) agreement on the common</li>
  <li>general management of the common</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be possible for the group to extend the scope of the existing single entity (provided it meets the 4 criteria explained below for a new single entity). This single entity should apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, using the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> it already has.</p>

<p>There should not be more than one single entity overseeing an agri-environment scheme agreement for the same area of land on the common. This includes <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>, <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If a group has not already set up a single entity to oversee an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreements or the general management of the common, it will need to do this before it applies for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on the common. It must register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> to obtain a new <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>, even if some of the members already have their own SBIs individually.</p>

<p>It’s up to the group to decide how the new single entity is set up, but it must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a main business contact identified for the RPA (the nominated representative)</li>
  <li>a bank account that’s registered with the RPA</li>
  <li>a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement between the single entity’s members to deal with any breaches of the agreement that may lead to the RPA recovering payments</li>
  <li>sufficient management control of the common land to complete land management actions for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about management control under ‘Common land eligibility’.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-higher-tier-manual-for-agreements-starting-on-1-january-2022/annex-6-common-land-and-shared-grazing-additional-requirements">Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) guidance</a> about setting up a commons association or an internal agreement for common land and shared grazing. Where this <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> guidance uses the word ‘must’ or ‘should’, that requirement applies to a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, not an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In setting up the single entity you may want to consider issues such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how changes in membership will be dealt with</li>
  <li>how payments will be distributed among members</li>
  <li>whether the nominated representative will give permission in the Rural Payments service for other members to view the relevant documentation</li>
  <li>how disputes will be resolved within the group</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to submit a copy of your formal internal arrangement to us, but you must supply this evidence to us if we ask for it.</p>

<h5>Additional payment for a single entity on common land</h5>

<p>To help with the costs of administering an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land, there is an annual additional payment of £6.15 per hectare of eligible common land entered into its own <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Our intention is that this payment will be available to single entities involving a group of two or more people entering common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In future, as more standards are made available, this additional payment will continue to be paid per hectare of eligible common land entered into the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, irrespective of the number of standards in the agreement.</p>

<p>This payment will be kept under review as <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Common land eligibility</h3>

<p>An area of common land is eligible to be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s wholly located in England</li>
  <li>the type of land and its mapped land cover are eligible for the standard(s) selected</li>
  <li>the single entity will have sufficient management control for the duration of the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Eligible land cover and type of land</h3>

<p>You can only enter an area of common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if it’s eligible for the standard you choose. This means it needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>be an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the ‘Eligible land’ section in each standard for more information about eligible land cover and land type.</p>

<p>Common land is not shown on your digital maps. You can check the maps we have previously provided to you to check the land cover on the common land. When you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land, you will be able to view the land parcels on a digital map as part of the application process. Before applications open, we’ll publish information on GOV.UK to help you apply on common land.</p>

<h4>What area of common land can be entered into <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>
</h4>

<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a whole common</li>
  <li>more than one whole common, if they are managed as a single unit</li>
  <li>part of a common, if it’s a defined area that’s managed as a separate, single unit and the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement won’t impact land management practices on the remaining part of the common</li>
</ul>

<p>If the common is in an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement, that same land can be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s eligible for the standards selected</li>
  <li>the activities being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>a similar activity isn’t being paid for on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that the same <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> agreement land is entered into the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Management control</h3>

<p>To enter common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, the single entity must have sufficient management control of that land for the 3-year duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>The single entity should have management control of the common land if it has sufficient control over how the land is managed to complete the actions in the standards chosen for the duration of the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>The single entity must judge whether it has sufficient management control. This does not mean that every commoner has to agree or become part of the single entity. However, it does mean that those who are part of the single entity need to be able to deliver the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>To have sufficient management control, the group will need to consider whether the landowner needs to be part of the single entity. A group must also assess if the landowner’s consent is needed for the single entity to complete the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If the landowner’s consent is needed, the group must obtain it.</p>

<p>Before applying for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, a group must take reasonable steps to contact and consult everyone with a legal interest in managing the common land. This is to make sure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aware of the group’s intention to enter the common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>have the chance to participate in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>The people with a legal interest in managing the common land include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all known common rights holders, whether they’re actively using their rights or not</li>
  <li>the landowner</li>
  <li>tenants</li>
  <li>anyone who has an easement or other rights and covenants over the land, including sporting tenants</li>
</ul>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship-higher-tier-manual-for-agreements-starting-on-1-january-2022/annex-6-common-land-and-shared-grazing-additional-requirements"><abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> guidance</a> for more information about consulting other people with a legal interest in managing the common. Where this <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> guidance uses the word ‘must’ or ‘should’, that requirement applies to a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, not an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>When the single entity enters common land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it declares that it will have management control of that land for the agreement’s 3-year duration. The single entity must supply evidence of this if we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on common land operates in the same way as an agreement on land outside a common.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement conflicts with any statutory requirements for the management of the common, those statutory requirements take precedence. For example, if the common land is in an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, or there are public engagement commitments. For more information, read the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> scheme information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-regulatory-issues-and-consents-that-could-affect-an-sfi-standards-agreement">regulatory issues and consents</a>.</p>

<p>Any breach of the common land <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement will only apply to that agreement. It will not apply to any separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for land outside of the common that you own or rent.</p>

<p>If the single entity decides to upgrade its <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it may need to check it still has management control and whether it needs any regulatory consents. As <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> is rolled out we will review this guidance and issue more information as required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>How an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement interacts with other funding schemes</h2>
<p>This information explains the interaction between land entered into a Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement and other schemes, as well as other funding sources.</p>

<p>Existing schemes will continue to run alongside <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>), until it is delinked in 2024</li>
  <li>Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Environmental Stewardship</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of 2024, new schemes will also be launched, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Nature Recovery</li>
  <li>Landscape Recovery</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Including land in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and other schemes at the same time</h3>

<p>It’s possible to include the same land in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and another scheme if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you and your land are eligible for each scheme</li>
  <li>the activities or outcomes you’re being paid for under each scheme are compatible</li>
  <li>you are not being paid for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Basic Payment Scheme</h3>

<p>You can include the same land parcel in a <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application and your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as it’s eligible for each scheme.</p>

<p>If you apply for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lump-sum-payments-for-farmers-who-leave-or-retire-from-farming-and-delinked-payments/lump-sum-exit-scheme-and-delinked-payments-how-the-payments-will-work">Lump Sum Exit Scheme</a> in 2022, you should not apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If you decide to withdraw your Lump Sum Exit Scheme application, you can then apply for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Countryside Stewardship</h3>

<p>The interaction between an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> is different depending on whether there’s a revenue option or capital items funding.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options</h4>

<p>If land used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
  <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option, cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>be used to complete any of the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you cannot enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an area of land used to establish a cover crop under <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> into the arable and horticultural soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
  <li>an area of land used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grass buffer strip on an improved grassland parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard you choose affects which <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h5>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options and the moorland standard</h5>

<p>Land used for all <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard, if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h5>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options and the soils standards</h5>

<p>You can enter land used for certain <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options into the introductory and intermediate levels in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-full-guidance/sustainable-farming-incentive-full-guidance#arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-full-guidance/sustainable-farming-incentive-full-guidance#improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a> in 2022.</p>

<p>If you use an area of a land parcel for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option not listed in tables 1 and 2 above, that area cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>However, you can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>For example, if part of a land parcel is used for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grass buffer strip, you can enter the rest of the area into either of the soils standards.</p>

<h4>Rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options</h4>

<p>A rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> option. You do this either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
  <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>You can enter the rest of the land parcel not covered by an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option into either of the soils standards (if it’s eligible land for the chosen standard).</p>

<p>The area currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option will be automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This means the total area entered into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not include the area currently used for an ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option.</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, the ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option area can be moved around the land parcels in your agreement. This is because we’ve already removed that area from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. However, this is only possible if the area of the ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option does not exceed the area automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, a land parcel currently includes 2ha of SW6. That area is automatically removed from that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, you can move that 2ha of SW6 around the land parcels in your agreement. However, if the area of SW6 increases to 2.5ha in either the second or third year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll need to add land to your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement at the annual upgrade point to accommodate the additional 0.5ha.</p>

<h4>Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you have an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement</h4>

<p>If you have an existing <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area is not included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. For example, if there is a 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) land parcel which has 2 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of AB2 (Basic overwinter stubble), the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application will be 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> in 2022</h4>

<p>You may be applying for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Higher Tier or Mid Tier (including the Wildlife Offers) agreement starting from 1 January 2023. This may affect your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application if you include the same area of land in both <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application and receive your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement offer before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, any area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options can be confirmed before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>In this case, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area isn’t included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>However, if the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options cannot be confirmed, it won’t be possible to automatically remove it from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This will be the case if you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> before you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application.</p>

<p>This means the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options is included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You can only enter the total ‘available area’ into the standard you choose. It cannot be reduced in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application to remove the area of ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue options.</p>

<p>If you enter the same area of land into both an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> soils standard and an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option in a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement that starts from 1 January 2023, your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payment will be automatically adjusted.</p>

<p>For example, you enter a 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> land parcel into one of the soils standards and include that same land parcel in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application. You have only included 1 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of this land parcel in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application, but it’s in an ineligible <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> revenue option for the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> soils standard you have chosen. If your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement starts after your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you will only be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payment on 9 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of that land parcel.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> capital items funding</h4>

<p>If you apply for a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Capital Grants agreement, the same land parcel can be entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Environmental Stewardship</h3>

<p>If land used for an Environmental Stewardship (ES) revenue option has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type for the standard you choose, you can enter it into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ES actions, including their timing, are compatible with the actions in the standard you choose</li>
  <li>you won’t be paid twice for a similar activity or outcome on the same area of land at the same time (known as double funding)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, the ineligible ES revenue option land, including any land currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option, cannot be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>used to complete any of the actions in the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you cannot enter an area of land:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used to establish a cover crop under ES into the arable and horticultural soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
  <li>used for an ES grass buffer strip on an improved grassland parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, or use it to meet the actions in that standard</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard you choose affects which ES revenue options are compatible and do not lead to double funding.</p>

<h4>ES revenue options and the moorland standard</h4>

<p>Land used for ES revenue options can be entered into the introductory level of the moorland standard if it has an eligible land cover and is an eligible land type.</p>

<p>This is because the introductory level of the moorland standard does not involve physical land management actions, so there is no incompatibility or double funding.</p>

<h4>ES revenue options and the soils standards</h4>

<p>You can enter land used for certain ES revenue options into the introductory and intermediate levels in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils standard</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a> in 2022.</p>

<p>These eligible ES revenue options are set out in tables 3 and 4.</p>

<h4>Rotational ES revenue options</h4>

<p>A rotational ES revenue option is a multi-annual land management option that can be moved around identified land parcels in your ES agreement.</p>

<p>Each year of your ES agreement, you declare the area currently used for a rotational ES option. You do this either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the ES annual revenue claim, usually submitted by 15 May each year</li>
  <li>by 1 September in the relevant year if you cannot declare its location on the ES annual revenue claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Any area within a land parcel that’s currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option cannot be entered into the soils standards.</p>

<p>The area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option will be automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This means the total area entered into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not include the area currently used for an ineligible rotational ES revenue option.</p>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement has started, the ineligible rotational ES revenue option area can be moved around the land parcels in your agreement. This is because we’ve already removed that area from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. However, this is only possible if the area of the ineligible rotational ES revenue option does not exceed the area automatically removed from the ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<h4>Applying for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you have an existing ES agreement</h4>

<p>If you have an existing ES agreement, we will automatically remove the area of ineligible ES revenue options from the affected land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. This includes any area currently used for ineligible rotational ES revenue options.</p>

<p>This means the area is not included in the affected land parcel’s ‘available area’ for you to select in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work/local-nature-recovery-more-information-on-how-the-scheme-will-work">Local Nature Recovery</a> (LNR) is expected to launch by the end of 2024. You’ll be able to apply for LNR options on land entered into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, as long as the eligibility and compatibility requirements are met and there’s no double funding.</p>

<p>The LNR options will initially cover the following themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing feeding, shelter and breeding areas for wildlife on arable farms</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating grassland habitats such as species-rich grassland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating wetland habitats such as ponds, lakes, reedbeds and fens</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating lowland heathland</li>
  <li>managing, restoring and creating coastal habitats such as sand dunes, salt marsh and shingle</li>
  <li>managing and restoring areas of upland and lowland peat and moorland on farms and in the wider countryside</li>
  <li>targeted measures to support the recovery and reintroduction of particular wildlife species, such as creating and managing nesting and feeding habitat, and to tackle non-native invasive species</li>
  <li>managing and creating trees and woodlands, including agroforestry, traditional orchards and tree planting on areas of farms (the England Woodland Creation Offer will be the main scheme for creating woodland until 2025)</li>
  <li>nature-based solutions for water, such as creating and managing in-field vegetation, buffer strips and swales to reduce and filter runoff and contribute to natural flood management</li>
  <li>restoring rivers, flood plains, streams and riparian habitats</li>
</ul>

<p>More LNR guidance will be published on GOV.UK over the next year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Check regulatory issues and consents that could affect an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>This information covers some of the land-based regulatory issues and consents that may affect you and your land. You must comply with all the other legal requirements that apply to you and your land.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement conflicts with any statutory requirements for the management of the land, you must comply with those statutory requirements.</p>

<p>You will need to check if the land you’re entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has scheduled monuments, historic or archaeological features</li>
  <li>is in a Site of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the land is affected by one of these it may affect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what you are able to do on that land</li>
  <li>whether you need to get consent before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h3>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland soils standard on any area with historical or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You will still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you will need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will be available when applications open. Once you’ve registered you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a>, which may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<p>You should avoid taking soil samples on land containing historic or archaeological features. If you need to take samples on land containing a scheduled monument to meet the requirements in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consent-for-soil-sampling-on-scheduled-monuments-sustainable-farming-incentive">get consent from Historic England</a>. You must not take any soil samples on the land containing the scheduled monument until Historic England tells you it has given its consent.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h3>

<p>If you have land in an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> that you’re entering into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you may need consent from Natural England. This depends on which standard you’re applying for.</p>

<p>Check <a class="govuk-link" href="http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&amp;chosenLayers=moncIndex,lbuildIndex,sssiIndex,sssiwalIndex,sssiscoIndex" rel="external">MAGIC</a> to find out if there is an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on your land.</p>

<h4>Arable and horticultural soils standard</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>However, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations requiring Natural England consent on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land to meet the actions in the introductory or intermediate levels under the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>If consent is required, you may want to get this from Natural England before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, to make sure you can complete the actions required under the arable and horticultural soils standard once your agreement starts.</p>

<h4>Improved grassland soils standard</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard. However, you must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the other actions under the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the other actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<h4>Moorland standard</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory level of the moorland standard.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the actions under the introductory level of the moorland standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<h4>Find out if you need <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> consent</h4>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">designated sites system</a> (DSS).

<p>If you need to get consent from Natural England to carry out a listed operation on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land, you will need to provide the required information about the activities you’re proposing to do. Read the GOV.UK information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#what-to-include-when-you-request-consent">what details to include when you request consent</a>.</p>

<p>When you enter <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you declare that you understand the agreement does not operate as <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> consent and that you will apply separately for consent from Natural England, where relevant. You must supply evidence to show that the necessary consent was obtained from Natural England this if we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Cross compliance</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cross-compliance-2022">cross compliance rules</a> do not apply to an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. However, you still need to meet any regulatory requirements that apply to you or your land. Being in an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement does not remove these requirements.</p>

<p>You must follow the cross compliance rules if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have land in other rural payments schemes covered by these rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Protected species</h3>

<p>You may need a wildlife licence if any of the actions in the standards you include in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application may affect protected species. You should keep the licence for evidence. You can read more information at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-wildlife-on-your-land">managing wildlife on your land on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>How an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement works</h2>
<p>This information explains what you’re agreeing to when you enter into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, when it will start and what changes you can request once your agreement starts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Entering into an agreement</h3>

<p>When you submit your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, we will process it. You’ll be notified when your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement offer is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-rural-payments">Rural Payments service</a> to review.</p>

<p>To enter into the agreement, you must accept it and sign it digitally. Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement cannot start until you do this.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement comprises the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agreement document, which you can view in the Rural Payments service</li>
  <li>standards you have chosen</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-standards-agreement-terms-and-conditions">scheme terms and conditions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By accepting your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you are agreeing to follow the scheme terms and conditions. You should read them carefully before you accept it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>How to review your agreement offer</h3>
<p>To review your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement offer, sign into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. From your ‘Business overview’ page, select ‘Environmental Land Management Applications and Agreements’ and ‘Open agreement’. You can then select ‘Download’ to view your agreement offer.</p>

<p>You can only accept or reject your agreement offer. You cannot request changes to it. You need to accept or reject your agreement offer within 15 working days of it being available.</p>

<p>To accept or reject your agreement offer, you must have either ‘<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> amend’, ‘<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> submit’ or ‘Business details: full’ permission.</p>

<p>To accept your agreement offer, select ‘Accept’ and tick the box to confirm you have read the declaration, then select the ‘Accept’ button on that screen. This means you have electronically signed the agreement. You do not need to print your agreement offer to sign and return it to us.</p>

<p>To reject your agreement offer, select ‘Reject’. You will then see the ‘Reject agreement offer’ screen with a free text box. To help us understand why you’re rejecting your agreement offer, you need to enter the reason (at least 10 characters) to be able to select ‘Reject’ on this screen. Once you’ve entered the reason, select ‘Reject’ and you’ll see a message that confirms we’ve received your rejection.</p>

<p>As there is no deadline to apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, you can re-apply at any time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>When your agreement will start</h3>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;standards agreements do not all start on a single date. The start date for your agreement depends on when you submit your&nbsp;<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;application, how long it takes to process and how quickly you accept your agreement offer.</p>

<p>Your&nbsp;<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;standards agreement cannot start until you accept it. You need to do this within 15 working days of it being available to review in the Rural Payments service.</p>

<p>If you accept your agreement by the end of the calendar month, it will start on the first day of the following calendar month. If you do not, it will start later, on the next available start date.</p>

<p>Your&nbsp;<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>&nbsp;standards agreement will last for 3 years from its start date, as shown on your agreement document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span>Submit an annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement</h3>

<p>You must submit an annual declaration for each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is to confirm you have complied with the obligations under your agreement for the relevant agreement year, which allows us to make your final quarterly payment for that year.</p>

<p>You’ll complete and submit your annual declaration online. It will be a straightforward process. You’ll need to submit it during the last 2 months of the relevant agreement year. We will remind you when it’s due and provide more information to help you complete it.</p>

<p>If you do not submit your annual declaration when it’s due, we may be unable to make your final quarterly payment for the relevant agreement year. We may also withhold your other payments or recover payments, and your agreement may be ended.</p>

<p>If you’ve been unable to comply with the obligations in your agreement, you cannot use the annual declaration to tell us this. Instead, you must notify us (in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable) if there is a change of circumstances.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span>Requesting changes to your agreement</h3>

<p>You’ll be able to request certain changes to your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span>Upgrading your agreement</h3>
<p>You can upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add more standards</li>
  <li>increase levels within standards already in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>add more land, including land coming out of a Countryside Stewardship agreement when it ends</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be able to submit an upgrade request towards the end of the first and second years of your 3-year agreement.</p>

<p>The upgrade requests can include all of the upgrades you would like to request for the next agreement year. It will need to be submitted by a deadline.</p>

<p>We’ll publish more information about when and how to submit your upgrade request. We will not accept your annual upgrade request if it’s received after that date.</p>

<p>If we approve your upgrade request, you’ll need to confirm that you accept your updated <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement by the date we’ll tell you. If you do this, your updated agreement will usually apply from the start of the following agreement year.</p>

<p>Your agreement will last for 3 years from its original start date.</p>

<p>If you do not accept your updated <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement by the date we’ll tell you, your original agreement will continue without the upgrades.</p>

<p>If we reject your upgrade request, we’ll tell you why we have rejected it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span>Removing standards, reducing the levels in the standards or land area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement or ending it early</h3>

<p>You’re usually expected to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement for its 3-year duration without:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removing standards</li>
  <li>reducing the level that you’ve selected for a standard</li>
  <li>removing land from the agreement</li>
  <li>ending the agreement early</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain situations, it may be possible for you to do this before its 3-year duration is completed. For example, we may agree to do this if you have a change of circumstances that makes it impossible for you to deliver all or part of the agreement.</p>

<p>If we agree to remove standards, reduce levels of the standards or remove land, or end your agreement early, you may have to repay some, or all, of the money already paid to you.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement payments are based on you completing the actions in the standards for a full agreement year, including submitting your annual declaration. If you have done this, you will not have to repay the money already paid to you. If you have not, you may need to make a repayment for the affected agreement year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span>Transferring an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to another person</h3>

<p>It will not usually be possible for you to transfer an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to another person.</p>

<p>If land in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement is transferred to another person, for example it is sold or a tenancy ends and there is a new tenant, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contacting-the-rpa-about-sfi">notify us about this change of circumstances</a> in writing as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Getting paid for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h2>
<p>This information explains how your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement payment will be calculated, when you’ll be paid and what you must do to get paid.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>How your payment is calculated</h3>

<p>The total annual payment for your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement is based on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level of a standard.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£10.30 per hectare</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>Where relevant, your total annual payment may also include an additional payment for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the moorland standard (£265 per agreement per year)</li>
  <li>common land entered into a separate <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement (£6.15 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>When you will be paid</h3>
<p>The total annual payment value is divided into 4 equal instalments and paid on a quarterly basis. The first quarterly payment will usually be made mid-way through the 4th month after the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Your subsequent quarterly payments will then be every 3 months after that.</p>

<p><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreements will not all start on a single date. The start date for your agreement will depend on when you submit your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, how long it takes to process and how quickly you accept your agreement offer.

<p>If you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> when applications open, your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement should start this autumn. In this case, your first quarterly payment should be made before the end of 2022.</p>

<p>Unlike other schemes, such as Countryside Stewardship, you don’t need to submit an annual revenue claim before you get paid. Your quarterly payments will usually be made automatically.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>What you must do to get paid</h3>

<p>To get paid under your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete the actions in the standards you have chosen for a full agreement year</li>
  <li>submit your annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement</li>
  <li>supply evidence specified in the standards when we ask for it</li>
</ul>

<p>A full agreement year means each 12-month period from the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If the levels of the standards or area of land in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement are reduced, or it’s ended early, you may have to repay some or all of the money already paid to you. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-works">requesting changes to your agreement</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not submit an annual declaration, your payments could be withheld. Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="#submit-annual-declaration">submitting an annual declaration</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span>Future changes to actions in the standards and payment rates</h3>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, the actions and payment rates for the standards you have chosen will not change, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>We will use a new, supportive approach for checking progress of your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement and that you’ve met its terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If you cannot deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll start by helping you to fix what’s gone wrong, wherever possible. Unlike previous schemes, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied.</p>

<p>The standards have been designed to include actions that you should be able to complete, to achieve the set of aims for each standard. You must do what’s required, but it’s up to you how to complete the actions, so you can make them work for your farm.</p>

<p>While the actions avoid being prescriptive, some do require you to complete an action on a percentage of land entered into the standard. In this case, it’s worth allowing a margin of error.</p>

<p>For example, in the arable and horticultural soils standard you must have at least 70% winter cover on land entered into the standard. You may want to try to do this on a slightly larger area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span>What we may check</h3>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we may check that you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meeting your agreement’s terms and conditions</li>
  <li>achieving the aims of the standards, by completing the required actions in a way that works on your farm</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span>How we’ll check your agreement</h3>

<p>We’ll use a range of methods to check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reviewing the annual declaration that you submit</li>
  <li>checking evidence we ask a proportion of agreement holders to supply, such as a soil management plan or soil organic matter test results</li>
  <li>carrying out site visits (physical or by video call) for a proportion of agreement holders</li>
  <li>using remote monitoring technology, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery</li>
</ul>

<h4>Annual declaration</h4>

<p>You must submit an annual declaration for each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This is to confirm your progress on completing the actions in your agreement. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-a-sfi-standards-agreement-works#submit-an-annual-declaration-to-confirm-progress-of-your-agreement">submitting an annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement</a>.</p>

<h4>Evidence you need to keep</h4>

<p>You can find out what evidence to keep for each action in the details of each standard. The evidence will show what you’ve done to complete the action. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<p>By completing all of the actions under the level selected for the standards, you should achieve the set of aims for that standard. The aim for each action is also explained in the details of each standard.</p>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement and it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the action’s aim, we may ask you for the evidence to show what you’ve done to complete the action.</p>

<h4>Site visits</h4>

<p>If your farm is selected for a site visit, we’ll try to arrange a suitable time and date with you in advance and let you know what to expect during the visit.</p>

<p>If that’s not possible, we’ll write to you by post or email explaining the purpose, date and time of the visit. This will be at least 48 hours before the visit.</p>

<p>An RPA field officer will then visit your farm. In most cases, the site visit will involve a discussion with you about how:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the aims of the standards in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement have been achieved</li>
  <li>the actions in the standards have been completed</li>
</ul>

<p>Where necessary to guide improvements, the RPA field officer will be able to conduct a review of all aspects of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/405/part/6/made" rel="external">the legislation</a> for the exact details of what someone visiting (or ‘authorised person’) can do.</p>

<h4>Remote monitoring</h4>

<p>Remote monitoring uses aerial photography and satellite imagery to monitor things like land cover, vegetation condition and soil erosion risk.</p>

<p>Remote monitoring aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the number of physical site visits</li>
  <li>make sure the standards are delivering environmental benefits</li>
  <li>automatically identify potential issues so that you can be given targeted support and guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span>What happens if you cannot deliver your agreement, or your circumstances change</h3>

<p>If you find that you cannot deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll try to be flexible and start by helping you to fix what’s gone wrong.</p>

<p>You may be unable to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement because something happens that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevents you completing the required actions</li>
  <li>affects how you can deliver your agreement</li>
  <li>means your circumstances change</li>
</ul>

<p>This may be for reasons within or outside your control.</p>

<p>If this is the case, you must notify us, in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable, if that change of circumstances affects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your eligibility</li>
  <li>the amount of money you should get</li>
  <li>your ability to deliver actions in the standards within your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> agreement</li>
  <li>your ability to comply with scheme terms and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>When you write to us, you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>your agreement reference number</li>
  <li>as many details as possible about the change of circumstances, including specific details about the standards you’re having issues with</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll look at each change of circumstances on a case-by-case basis. Depending on what’s happened, we may decide to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amend your agreement</li>
  <li>end your agreement early</li>
  <li>adjust your payments</li>
  <li>ask you to repay money already paid to you</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can use the complaints process to ask for it to be reconsidered. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you are notified of our decision.</p>

<p>It will be a breach of your agreement if you do not tell us about the change of circumstances when you are required to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span>How you could breach your agreement</h3>

<p>You could breach your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement if you do not meet its terms and conditions.</p>

<p>This includes if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not complete the actions required in the standards</li>
  <li>do not report, as soon as reasonably practicable, a change of circumstances which affects your ability to deliver your agreement</li>
  <li>give false or misleading information</li>
  <li>do not provide information or evidence when it’s asked for, in the way it’s asked for</li>
  <li>prevent a site visit from being carried out</li>
  <li>refuse to assist an authorised person during a site visit</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span>What happens if there has been a suspected breach</h3>

<p>We may find a suspected breach during checks on the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If this happens, we will investigate the suspected breach. Unlike previous schemes, we will not usually withhold your payments if a breach is suspected.</p>

<p>Where possible we’ll discuss this investigation with you, so you understand what we’ve considered. You may also be asked to supply further information or evidence to us as part of this investigation.</p>

<p>Once we’ve completed our investigation, we’ll tell you the outcome. If you do not agree with the outcome, you’ll have the opportunity to make written representations on why you do not agree. When we write to you with the outcome of the investigation, we’ll explain how to make written representations, including the time limit for submitting these to us.</p>

<p>We’ll consider your written representations before making a formal determination on whether there has been a breach.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span>What happens if a breach is confirmed</h3>

<p>If we decide that there has been a breach of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we’ll write to inform you of this within a reasonable period. We’ll give you the reasons for this decision. We’ll then decide what action needs to be taken, if any.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll look at the individual circumstances of your case and consider various factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the seriousness of the breach</li>
  <li>if you had a good reason for the breach</li>
  <li>why the breach happened and any consequences it may have</li>
  <li>what impact the breach has on delivering the aims of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, and whether that impact will be short or longer term</li>
  <li>if you can take action to make sure you are delivering your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>any past conduct and whether similar breaches have happened before</li>
  <li>if you intentionally breached your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>whether the breach constitutes an offence and has caused widespread or irreparable damage</li>
  <li>if you have not co-operated with us checking on your progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>whether you’ve notified us about a change of circumstances, if relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not agree with our decision, you can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/rural-payments-agency/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> to ask for it to be reconsidered. You must do this within 60 calendar days of the date you are notified about our decision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span>Good reasons for a breach</h3>

<p>There may be a ‘good reason’ for a breach of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, for reasons outside your control.</p>

<p>In this case, you (or someone authorised to act on your behalf) must write to us to explain this.</p>

<p>You must write to us immediately if your good reason relates to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preventing us from carrying out a site visit,</li>
  <li>refusing to provide assistance with a site visit</li>
</ul>

<p>In all other cases, you must do this within 8 weeks from either the date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are able to</li>
  <li>we notify you of the breach</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, we’ll also take good reasons into account when we investigate suspected breaches. During this investigation, if we agree that there are good reasons for a breach, we may be able to tell you during that investigation what, if anything, needs to be done.</p>

<p>Good reasons for a breach include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>natural events, such as prolonged adverse weather conditions, flooding, or animal or plant disease</li>
  <li>if you are seriously ill</li>
  <li>the death of an agreement holder</li>
  <li>unforeseen loss of management control of land, for example when a tenancy is terminated, or because of the compulsory purchase of land by a third party</li>
  <li>financial circumstances, such as bankruptcy</li>
  <li>evidenced supply chain problems, such as a lack of soil testing capacity</li>
  <li>criminal damage by a third party, such as arson or vandalism</li>
</ul>

<p>When you write to us, you should include your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>), agreement reference number and explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what has happened</li>
  <li>what good reason led to the breach</li>
  <li>whether you can fix the problem</li>
  <li>how the good reason meant you were unable to deliver your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>any evidence or information that may support your case</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider your individual situation and may ask for additional evidence</li>
  <li>decide what action, if any, needs to be taken</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are aware of the issue when entering into your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it’s unlikely we’ll consider it to be a good reason for a breach.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.8 </span>What action we may take when there is a breach</h3>

<p>We may not take any action at all depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the nature of the breach</li>
  <li>any evidence you supply of a good reason for the breach</li>
</ul>

<p>If we need to take action, we’ll look at what you can do to fix what’s gone wrong with the delivery of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. We may also consider taking more formal action to deal with the breach.</p>

<p>If we need to take more formal action, you may have to repay some or all of the payments already made to you. This is because your payments are based on you completing the actions in the standards for a full agreement year, including submitting your annual declaration. A full agreement year means each 12-month period from the start date of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If you have to make a repayment, there will be no additional financial ‘penalties’ applied, as used to be applied under previous schemes.</p>

<p>If we decide it’s possible for you to fix what’s gone wrong with the delivery of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, we will write to you and explain what you must do.</p>

<p>If you do this within the relevant full agreement year, you will not have to repay payments already received for that year.</p>

<p>If you do not do this within the relevant full agreement year, you will not have completed all the actions you need to. This means you will have to repay payments already received for that year. We may also amend your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Depending on the circumstances, your future payments may be reduced or withheld.</p>

<p>We may decide that there is a serious breach because it was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intentional</li>
  <li>due to negligence or recklessness</li>
  <li>has happened more than once, without good reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case of a serious breach, we could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>end your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>prevent you from receiving payments under any other financial assistance scheme for up to 2 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where there is evidence of fraud or illegality, we will pursue that in line with the law on those issues.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span>Terms and conditions</h2>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<h4>1.1 The Sustainable Farming Incentive</h4>

<p>The Sustainable Farming Incentive (“<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>”) is a scheme run by the Rural Payments Agency (referred to below as “us”, “we, “our”) on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (“Defra”).

<p>(c) any other regulatory consent required by the Law.</p>

<h4>3. Management Control of the Agreement Land</h4>

<h4>3.1 What is Management Control</h4>

<p>You will have “Management Control” if you have sufficient control over how the Agreement Land is managed to complete the Actions in the Standards at the Level you have chosen. This is explained in the section about ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-you-and-your-land-are-eligible-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">Check you and your land are eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>’ in the Scheme Rules.</p>

<p>(c) If you lose Management Control of part of the Agreement Land, the affected land will be removed from the Agreement and you may have to repay some or all of the Grant already received as set out in condition 7 (Change of Circumstances).</p>

<h4>3.4 Tenanted Land</h4>

<p>If you hold land under a Farm Business Tenancy under the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 or an Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 tenancy:</p>

<p>(a) you must ensure that by entering the land into the Agreement you do not breach the conditions of your tenancy; and</p>

<p>(b) if the tenancy expires before the Agreement End Date, you must only include this land in your Agreement Land if you expect to have Management Control of this land for the entire Agreement Period.</p>

<h4>4. Common Land and Shared Grazing</h4>

<h4>4.1 What is Common Land and Shared Grazing</h4>

<p>The definitions of common land(“Common Land”) and shared grazing (“Shared Grazing”) are explained in the section about ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eligibility-of-commons-and-shared-grazing-land-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">Eligibility of commons and shared grazing for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>’ in the Scheme Rules and any reference to Common Land in these Terms and Conditions or the Scheme Rules applies to Shared Grazing.</p>

<h4>4.2 What Common Land can be included in the Agreement</h4>

<p>You must enter Common Land into a separate Agreement. The section about ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eligibility-of-commons-and-shared-grazing-land-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement">Eligibility of commons and shared grazing for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>’ in the Scheme Rules explains what you must do if your Agreement Land is Common Land.</p>

<h4>4.3 What you must do if your Agreement Land is Common Land</h4>

<p>(a) If your Agreement Land is Common Land, you must be a “single entity”, either as a sole beneficiary or a group.</p>

<p>(b) you (the single entity under condition 4.3(a)) must have sufficient Management Control of the Common Land so that you can comply with your obligations under the Agreement for the entire Agreement Period. For a group to have sufficient Management Control you must also:</p>

<p>(i) take reasonable steps to contact and consult everyone with a legal interest in the management of the Common Land; and</p>

<p>(ii) obtain the consent of the owner of the Common Land if it is required</p>

<p>(c) If the single entity is a group, you must:</p>

<p>(i) have a formal, legally enforceable internal arrangement;</p>

<p>(ii) identify a main business contact (the ‘nominated representative’) with us who will be responsible for administering the Agreement on behalf of the group; and</p>

<p>(iii) have a bank account registered with us.</p>

<h4>5. Annual Declaration</h4>

<h4>5.1 What is the Annual Declaration</h4>

<p>Your “Annual Declaration” confirms that you have complied, or expect to have complied, with your obligations under the Agreement for the relevant Agreement Year. This is explained in the section about ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-a-sfi-standards-agreement-works#submit-an-annual-declaration-to-confirm-progress-of-your-agreement">Submit an annual declaration to confirm progress of your agreement’</a> in the Scheme Rules.</p>

<h4>5.2 When to submit an Annual Declaration</h4>

<p>You must submit your Annual Declaration to us each ‘Agreement Year’ (each twelve (12) month period following the Agreement Start Date). You must do this by a date that we will specify (the “Due Date”) which will be within the last two (2) months of the relevant Agreement Year.</p>

<h4>5.3 What happens if you do not submit your Annual Declaration</h4>

<p>If you do not submit your Annual Declaration by the Due Date, it may affect the Grant paid to you as set out in condition 9 (Payments), and we may also treat this as a breach of your obligations under the Agreement under condition 12.</p>

<h4>6. Changes to your Agreement</h4>

<h4>6.1 How you can upgrade your Agreement</h4>

<p>(a) You can request to upgrade your Agreement (an ‘Upgrade Request’) to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Add a Standard to the Agreement</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Move to a higher Level of a Standard already in your Agreement</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Add land to the Agreement</p>

<p>The section about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-a-sfi-standards-agreement-works#requesting-changes-to-your-agreement">requesting changes to your agreement</a> in the Scheme Rules explains what changes you can request to upgrade the Agreement.</p>

<p>(b) You can submit one Upgrade Request in an Agreement Year. This can only be done in your first and second Agreement Year.</p>

<p>(c) You must submit the Upgrade Request by a date that we will specify in the Scheme Information. We will not accept an Upgrade Request after this date.</p>

<p>(d) Each Upgrade Request can include one or more of the upgrades listed in condition 6.1(a).</p>

<h4>6.2 What happens if you request a change to upgrade your Agreement</h4>

<p>(a) We will consider your Upgrade Request under condition 6.1 and decide whether to approve it.</p>

<p>(b) We will confirm whether we have approved or rejected your Upgrade Request at the earliest practicable opportunity.</p>

<p>(c) If we approve your Upgrade Request, it will usually apply from the start of the following Agreement Year. We may allow your updated Agreement to continue with its original Agreement Period or we may specify a different Agreement Period.</p>

<p>(d) Where we approve your Upgrade Request, we will ask you to confirm acceptance of your updated Agreement within a time period specified by us. If you do not confirm acceptance within the time period we specify, the Agreement will not be updated.</p>

<h4>6.3 Removing Standards, reducing Levels or removing land parcels from the Agreement</h4>

<p>(a) During the Agreement Period, we will not usually allow you to remove a Standard, move Agreement Land to a lower Level under the Standards or remove land parcels from the Agreement Land. This is explained in the section about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-a-sfi-standards-agreement-works#requesting-changes-to-your-agreement">requesting changes to your agreement</a> in the Scheme Rules.</p>

<p>(b) If you want to remove a Standard or move to a lower Level under the Standards or remove land parcels forming part of the Agreement Land, you must write to us to request this and explain (providing any supporting evidence) why you wish to do so.</p>

<p>(c) We will consider requests under condition 6.3 on a case-by-case basis and may allow the request if there is a Change of Circumstances as defined in condition 7. We will inform you of our decision within a reasonable time period.</p>

<p>(d) If we approve a request to remove a Standard or move to a lower Level under the Standards or remove land parcels forming part of the Agreement Land, then we may reduce, recover or withhold payment of the Grant in whole or in part until that request has been processed and the Agreement amended accordingly.</p>

<h4>6.4 When we may change your Agreement</h4>

<p>(a) We will not usually seek to vary your Agreement during the Agreement Period (in a way not referred to elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions).</p>

<p>(b) However, it is possible we may offer you an Agreement upgrade during the Agreement Period. For example, this may be the case if we make changes to these Terms and Conditions or the Standards.</p>

<p>(c) If we offer you an Agreement upgrade under condition 6.4(b), we will notify you in writing setting out the details. It will be possible for you either to accept the Agreement upgrade or continue with your existing Agreement.</p>

<p>(d) There may also be exceptional circumstances (not referred to elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions) where we have to vary your Agreement during the Agreement Period. We will only do this due to exceptional circumstances, such as:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) changes in Law which must be reflected in the Agreement;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the need to respond to wider government emergency measures and/or measures imperative to the national interest, for example, disease outbreaks or food security emergencies.</p>

<p>(e) If we vary the Agreement under condition 6.4(d):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) we will notify you in writing and will endeavour to give such notice as is reasonable and proportionate, having regard to the nature of the variation and its consequences for you;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) any variation to the Agreement will apply from the date we specify in our notice to you; and</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) if the variation to the Agreement under condition 6.4(d) is unacceptable to you, you can terminate your Agreement by notifying us in writing within a reasonable period that we will specify in our notice to you.&nbsp; Condition 15.3(d) will not apply provided you inform us within the period specified by us.</p>

<p>(b) the Grant you should receive;</p>

<p>(c) your ability to complete the Actions in the Standards; or</p>

<p>(a) If you sell, lease or otherwise transfer all or part of the Agreement Land to another party or entity (the “Transferee”) during the Agreement Period so that you no longer have Management Control over all or part of the Agreement Land we will not usually allow you to transfer your Agreement to the Transferee.</p>

<p>(b) In the case of 8.1(a) you must notify us of your loss of Management Control of all or part of the Agreement Land (as set out in condition 3.3) using the procedure in condition 7 (Change of Circumstances).</p>

<p>(c) Where you notify us that there has been a Change of Circumstances under condition 8.1(a), we may agree, at our absolute discretion and in limited circumstances only, that you may transfer the Agreement to the Transferee provided the conditions laid out in regulation 12 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/405/made" rel="external">the Regulations</a> are met.</p>

<h4>9. Payments</h4>

<h4>9.1 Frequency of payments</h4>

<p>The total annual Grant is divided into four (4) quarterly instalments. The first instalment of the Grant will usually be made three (3) months after the Start Date of the Agreement if you have complied with the obligations under the Agreement. This is explained under the section about ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-paid-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement#when-you-will-be-paid">When you will be paid’</a> in the Scheme Rules.</p>

<h4>9.3 When payments may be delayed, reduced, recovered or withheld</h4>

<p>We may delay, reduce, recover or withhold the payment of the Grant in whole or in part if you do not submit the Annual Declaration required under condition 5; and/or you breach your Agreement under condition 12.</p>

<h4>10. Undue payments or overpayments</h4>

<h4>10.1 Undue payments or overpayments</h4>

<p>It is your responsibility to check all the payments of the Grant we make to you and to notify us within two (2) weeks of you becoming aware if you have any reason to believe an error has occurred. You must repay any overpayment or payment of the Grant to which you are not entitled (including due to our administrative error).</p>

<h4>10.2 When a repayment must be made</h4>

<h4>11.2 How we will check you are complying with your obligations under the Agreement</h4>

<p>(a) for virtual or physical site visits:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) allow a person authorised by us to carry out site visits and exercise powers of entry under the Regulations (‘Authorised Person’) access to any Agreement Land, premises, livestock, trees, crops, plants, machinery, equipment, documents or records (or any related apparatus) covered by the Agreement.&nbsp; The Authorised Person may be accompanied by such other persons as they consider necessary; and</p>

<span class="number">13.1 </span>The standards available in 2022</h3>

<p>In 2022, there are 3 standards available in the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">arable and horticultural soils</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-moorland-standard">moorland</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can only enter a land parcel into one of these 3 standards. In future, standards will be designed to be compatible with each other. You will be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<p>You may already be doing some of these actions on your land. If this is the case, these will usually count towards achieving the standard’s aims.</p>

<p>You will not be paid for actions you are already required to do by law.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>The levels available in each standard in 2022</h3>

<p>The actions in each standard are grouped into levels. The information for each standard explains what is required at each level and how to achieve its aims.</p>

<p>If you choose a higher level, you have to do more actions and you will be paid more.</p>

<p>The levels you can choose in 2022 are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Standard</th>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arable and horticultural soils</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Improved grassland soils</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Moorland</td>
      <td>Introductory</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each land parcel can only be in one level, but you don’t have to choose the same level for all the land parcels entered into a standard. For example, you can select one land parcel for the introductory level and another land parcel for the intermediate level.</p>

<p>By 2025, these standards will all have 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
  <li>advanced</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span>Future standards and levels</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> will expand each year, with the full set of standards in place by 2025.</p>

<p>Along with a wider range of standards, higher levels for existing standards will be added between now and 2025.</p>

<p>You can upgrade your agreement every 12 months from its start date. This will allow you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add more standards</li>
  <li>increase levels within standards already in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>add more land, including land coming out of a Countryside Stewardship agreement when it ends</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that each year there will be more you can choose to do and you’ll get paid more as a result.</p>

<p>You will not usually be able to remove standards, reduce levels for existing standards or remove land from your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>These new standards and additional levels are only an indication of what may be introduced. They may be changed based on feedback from farmers and others.</p>

<p>In the future, we will continue to evaluate the success of <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> as the scheme develops. We may make changes to standards and levels, where necessary, to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure there is value for public money</li>
  <li>secure the right outcomes for the environment</li>
  <li>take account of new or amended regulations</li>
  <li>avoid duplication, for example with private sector funding or accreditation schemes</li>
</ul>

<p>If we change standards or levels, these changes will only apply to land being entered into the standard or level for the first time or when an existing <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement is renewed at the end of its 3-year duration. We may also offer you an upgrade to your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement during its 3-year term, which you could accept or reject.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> arable and horticultural soils standard</h2>

<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the arable and horticultural soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h4>How the arable and horticultural soils standard will improve the environment</h4>
<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the arable and horticultural soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water quality</li>
  <li>climate resilience</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Eligible land for the arable and horticultural soils standard</h4>

<p>You can only enter land into the arable and horticultural soils standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>
<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-your-land-details">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the arable and horticultural soils standard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arable Land</li>
  <li>Permanent Crops (only perennial crops)</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>For more information about how the available area is automatically calculated, read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-online-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-on-land-outside-a-common">how to apply online for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on land outside a common</a>.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard if its land type is cultivated arable land. This includes land used for horticultural crops, such as field vegetables, and temporary grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise cultivated arable land parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can choose to view this as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable land and enter it into the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
  <li>improved grassland and enter it into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for 5 consecutive years or more becomes classified as permanent grassland from the 6th year if it’s not been included in a crop rotation.</p>

<p>If you enter temporary grassland into this standard that becomes permanent grassland during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, it won’t be eligible for this standard unless it’s included in your arable crop rotation. In this case, you can enter the temporary grassland into this standard. We may contact you during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to confirm that the grassland is part of your arable crop rotation.</p>

<p>Temporary and permanent improved grassland is eligible for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-sfi-improved-grassland-soils-standard">improved grassland soils standard</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as Countryside Stewardship, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc" rel="external">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>
  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a> that may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out about soil sampling on scheduled monuments, historic or archaeological features, read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-regulatory-issues-and-consents-that-could-affect-an-sfi-standards-agreement#scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features">regulatory issues and consents that could affect an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<h4>Sites of special scientific interest</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>However, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations requiring Natural England consent on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land to meet the actions in the introductory or intermediate levels under the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<p>If consent is required, you may want to get this from Natural England before you enter the land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, to make sure you can complete the actions required under the arable and horticultural soils standard once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts.</p>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">designated sites system</a>. You can also find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#get-consent-to-carry-out-operations-on-your-land">getting consent to carry out operations on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 3 (add organic matter) on land with peaty soil, as explained later in this section. You’ll still be paid for this area even if you do not complete action 3. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4>Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>How the arable and horticultural soils standard works</h3>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the arable and horticultural soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<h4>Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There is an additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 and may include use of no-tillage techniques. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£22 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
      <td>£40 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £22 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of land into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £40 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#getting-paid">payments</a>.</p>

<h4>When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, for example, establishing winter cover by the start of December, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h4>Checking the progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check the progress of your agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

<p>Read the information on <a class="govuk-link" href="#checking-progress">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span>Summary of the actions</h3>

<p>The introductory level actions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</li>
  <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>
  <li>action 3: add organic matter to all land in the standard at least once during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 70% of land in the standard over winter</li>
</ul>

<p>The intermediate level actions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action 1: complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</li>
  <li>action 2: test soil organic matter</li>
  <li>action 3: add organic matter to all land in the standard at least once during the 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>action 4: have green cover on at least 50% of land in this level of the standard over winter and multi-species cover crops on an additional 20% of the land</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span>Details of the actions</h3>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into the standard</li>
  <li>produced a written soil management plan</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
  <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>We’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you undertake.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.6 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will enable you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard has been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
  <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>you keep evidence of the situation so you can provide this evidence if we ask for it</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">how to sample and test soil organic matter</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.7 </span>Action 3: Add organic matter</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that, by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, your soil organic matter levels have either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been maintained at a healthy level if this is already the case</li>
  <li>increased to healthy levels</li>
</ul>

<p>This will improve the long-term productivity of your soil, and also brings benefits for soil biodiversity and carbon storage.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must add organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard to improve soil health. This can be any kind of organic matter.</p>

<p>For the introductory level, this can include sown green cover crops established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>For the intermediate level, this can include multi-species green cover established for action 4 (winter cover).</p>

<p>If your land has ‘peaty soil’, you should not complete this action on that land because adding organic matter can speed up peat decomposition. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you. You’ll still be paid for this area in this standard, even if you cannot complete the action.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must do this on every land parcel entered into this standard at least once during your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. This could be done as part of your crop rotation.</p>

<p>By the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have added organic matter to the soil of all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">how to add organic matter</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.8 </span>Action 4: Winter cover</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>For both the introductory and intermediate levels, the aim is that there is a well-established winter cover across at least 70% of the land entered into the standard each year. This is to help protect the soil surface and provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and runoff.</p>

<p>The multi-species cover crop element of the intermediate level has the additional aim of providing winter cover with a more diverse range of plants involving 2 or more species, on at least 20% of the land entered into this level of the standard. This is to benefit soil structure and health more than would be achieved with a single species.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>For the introductory level, over winter you must have a well-established green cover on at least 70% of the land entered into this level of the standard. 
Green cover is any crop or vegetation that covers bare soil to protect it over the winter. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>autumn-sown crops such as winter cereals, linseed and oilseed rape</li>
  <li>a quick-growing cover crop</li>
  <li>leaving weedy stubbles that give sufficient cover to protect the soil</li>
</ul>

<p>For the intermediate level, over winter you must have well-established:</p>

<ul>
  <li>green cover on at least 50% of the land entered into this level of the standard</li>
  <li>multi-species cover crops on at least an additional 20% of the land entered into this level of the standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Multi-species cover crops are a sown mix of plant species grown together on the same area of land to protect the soil and improve its health.</p>

<p>As a minimum, the multi-species cover crops must include a mix of at least two species from one or more of these plant families:</p>

<ul>
  <li>brassica</li>
  <li>legume</li>
  <li>grass or cereal</li>
  <li>herbs</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose any mix that works for your farm. Choosing a varied mix (with multiple species from different plant families and with different characteristics) will normally bring greater benefits to your soil and make it easier to show you’ve met the aim of this action.</p>

<p>A well-established green cover is where there is leafy vegetation that’s sufficiently well grown to protect the soil, from the start of December. There should be minimal bare soil. If this is not possible, for example due to prolonged adverse weather, you must let us know. Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#checking-progress">checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</a>.</p>

<p>For both introductory and intermediate levels, you must not leave any land bare over winter if it is at high risk of erosion or runoff.</p>

<p>You can use existing areas of multi-species cover crops and temporary grassland for this action.</p>

<p>You can also use areas of green cover or multi-species cover crops on your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses">GAEC 1</a>
</li>
  <li>2-metre cross compliance green cover requirement under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-7a-boundaries">GAEC 7a</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can graze the winter cover, but it still needs to be well-established over winter.</p>

<p>The green cover and multi-species cover crops under this action can also be used to meet action 3 (add soil organic matter). If you do this, it must meet the aim of action 3.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have a well-established green cover (and multi-species cover crops at intermediate level) by the start of December.</p>

<p>You must keep the green cover (and multi-species cover crops) until the end of February. After this, you can destroy the winter cover if you choose, being careful to minimise risks such as compaction, poaching, soil runoff or erosion.</p>

<p>Where conditions allow, you may destroy the winter cover before the end of February to establish an early-sown spring crop. You must not do this more than 6 weeks before you establish that spring crop.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-arable-and-horticultural-soils-standard">how to establish green cover</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> improved grassland soils standard</h2>

<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the improved grassland soils standard of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. The other information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the improved grassland soils standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard will improve the environment</h3>

<p>As soils are one of the most important natural assets, the improved grassland soils standard is focused on improving soil health, structure, organic matter, and biology. These improvements can benefit food production. They also contribute to a range of environmental and climate change outcomes, including better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water quality</li>
  <li>climate resilience</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>Eligible land for the improved grassland soils standard</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into the improved grassland soils standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>You can view the land cover currently registered for each land parcel on your digital maps in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Rural Payments service</a>. Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#check-your-land-details">land cover and checking your digital maps before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The eligible land covers for the improved grassland soils standard are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arable Land (only if its land type is improved temporary grassland)</li>
  <li>Permanent Grassland (only if its land type is improved permanent grassland)</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Drain/Ditch/Dyke on a boundary</li>
  <li>Other (non-agricultural) – Track – natural surface</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of these eligible land covers, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>For more information about how the available area is automatically calculated, read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-apply-online-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement-on-land-outside-a-common">how to apply online for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement on land outside a common</a>.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard if its land type is improved grassland. This includes both permanent and temporary grassland, as long as it’s improved grassland. If there are drains, ditches, dykes or tracks with a natural surface in an otherwise improved grassland parcel, those can be viewed as part of that land parcel’s eligible land type area.</p>

<p>To qualify as improved grassland, the land will have been managed in some or all of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular re-seeding, or has been reseeded within the last 15 years</li>
  <li>regular fertilising with typically at least 100 kg per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of nitrogen as an artificial compound fertiliser or animal manures and slurries</li>
  <li>boom spraying herbicide to treat weeds</li>
  <li>active, well-maintained field drains</li>
  <li>taking any conserved forage as silage, haylage or hay, usually more than once a year</li>
</ul>

<p>Improved grassland will usually have a high coverage of ryegrass and white clover.</p>

<p>Permanent grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage, which has not been included in the crop rotation for 5 or more consecutive years. It may have been reseeded during that time.</p>

<p>Temporary grassland is land that has been in grass or other herbaceous forage for less than 5 consecutive years. You can enter this into either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the improved grassland soils standard, if it’s improved grassland</li>
  <li>the arable and horticultural soils standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Unimproved grassland is not eligible for this standard. Unimproved grassland means land that has not been cultivated within the last 15 years. For example, it will not have been cultivated during this 15-year period by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sowing or reseeding</li>
  <li>ploughing, or an activity that breaks the soil surface or disrupts the subsoil</li>
  <li>adding artificial fertiliser or soil improvers</li>
</ul>

<p>This unimproved grassland may be eligible for Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) grassland options. A low and no input grassland standard should be available in <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> from 2024.</p>

<p>Unimproved grassland will usually have a diverse sward made up of a range of grasses and wildflowers.</p>

<p>If you have recently created a species rich sward, for example, under a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement, you cannot enter that area into this standard. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="#how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, you’ll be shown the total available area for each land parcel, based on the land covers that are eligible for the improved grassland soils standard. This total available area must be improved grassland. If it is not, you must not select that land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, as you cannot reduce the available area in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application.</p>

<p>For example, you must not select a land parcel if its total available area is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Permanent Grassland land cover, but only 8 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved permanent grassland</li>
  <li>10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> based on its Arable land cover, but only 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> is improved temporary grassland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Other land eligibility issues to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h4>Land in another agri-environment scheme agreement</h4>

<p>Land in an existing agri-environment scheme agreement, such as <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>, may also be eligible for an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-an-sfi-standards-agreement-interacts-with-other-funding-schemes">interaction between <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> and other schemes</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h4>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>You must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) in the improved grassland soils standard on any area with historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>. You’ll still be paid for this area entered into the standard.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You will then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>

<h4>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h4>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard. However, you must not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the other actions under the introductory and intermediate levels of the improved grassland soils standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check.</p>

<p>If you intend to complete the other actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">designated sites system</a>. You can also find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#get-consent-to-carry-out-operations-on-your-land">getting consent to carry out operations on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Peaty soil</h4>

<p>Land with ‘peaty soil’ is eligible for this standard. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<p>You should not complete action 4 (establish and maintain herbal leys) of this standard on land with peaty soil as explained below. You’ll still be paid for this area, even if you do not complete action 4. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4>Organically farmed land</h4>

<p>To ensure value for public money, we expect that organically farmed land will be entered into the intermediate level of this standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span>How the improved grassland soils standard works</h3>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land management actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the improved grassland soils standard, it cannot be selected for the other 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard, where this is the case.</p>

<h4>Different levels</h4>

<p>The actions are grouped into two levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introductory</li>
  <li>intermediate</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the actions are the same in both levels. There’s one additional action in the intermediate level.</p>

<p>You can select different levels for different land parcels entered into this standard. For example, you can enter one land parcel into the introductory level and another land parcel into the intermediate level.</p>

<p>An advanced level is likely to be available from 2023 onwards. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Payment</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Introductory</td>
      <td>£28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intermediate</td>
      <td>£58 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This means if you enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the introductory level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £28 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
  <li>20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> into the intermediate level, your total annual payment is based on 20 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> x £58 per <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard, even if the action only has to be completed on a percentage area of that land.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-paid-for-an-sfi-standards-agreement"><abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> payments</a>.</p>

<h4>When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard. This is explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<p>If your agreement starts too late for you to complete an action, you can complete it within 12 months of your agreement start date.</p>

<h4>Checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.6 </span>Details of the actions</h3>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the improved grassland soils standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.7 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim, which is for you to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessed the soil for all the land entered into this standard</li>
  <li>produced a written soil management plan for that land</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must complete an assessment of your soil and produce a written soil management plan covering all the land parcels entered into this standard.</p>

<p>If you already have a written soil management plan informed by a soil assessment, you can use it to meet this action.</p>

<p>To help us improve national data on the condition of England’s soils, you’ll need to provide some information when we ask you for it as part of the soils strategy once it’s launched. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic information from your soil assessment</li>
  <li>the soil organic matter test results under action 2</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is one of the public goods that the standard is paying for and part of wider government measures in relation to our future soils strategy.</p>

<p>We’ll publish guidance on GOV.UK about what basic information is needed and how to supply it to us.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must complete the soil assessment and produce the written soil management plan within the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You must review the soil management plan each year of your agreement, adding any new soil analysis you do.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You can record the soil management plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard">how to assess your soils and produce a soil management plan</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your soil management plan, including your soil assessment. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.8 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that you have tested the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> on all the land parcels entered into this standard within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>This will help you to plan how to increase the long-term health and productivity of your soil.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard have been tested for soil organic matter (<abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr>) within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>You can use existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results to meet this action, but they cannot be more than 5 years old.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>During your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must make sure that each land parcel entered into this standard has been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years.</p>

<p>If your existing <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results reach 5 years old, you must retest that land parcel.</p>

<p>If you have not tested some or all of the land parcels entered into this standard for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years, you should try to do this during the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>If this timing is not possible because the laboratory that does your <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> tests does not have capacity, you must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tests for these land parcels are done as soon as possible</li>
  <li>all of these land parcels have been tested for <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> within the last 5 years by the end of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</li>
  <li>you keep evidence of the situation so you can provide this evidence if we ask for it</li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to carry out this action at the same time as your other routine soil testing required in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/farming-rules-for-water-in-england">Farming Rules for Water</a>.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action. You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard">how to sample and test soil organic matter</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.9 </span>Action 3: Minimise bare ground over winter</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there’s minimal bare ground across all of the land entered into this standard over winter.</p>

<p>This will help to protect the soil surface. It will also provide root growth that maintains soil structure, supports soil biology and minimises nutrient leaching, soil erosion and runoff.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must make sure that no more than 5% of the total area of land entered into the standard is left bare, or becomes bare, over winter.</p>

<p>Bare land is any area of land where the soil is not covered by vegetation and is directly exposed to the elements.</p>

<p>You must not leave any land bare over winter if it’s at high risk of erosion or run-off.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>Each year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must have no more than 5% of the land entered into this standard as bare ground from the start of December until the end of February.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard">how to avoid bare ground</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.10 </span>Action 4: Establish and maintain herbal leys</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is that there is a sward with a mix of grasses, legumes and herbs on at least 15% of the land entered into this standard.</p>

<p>This will provide varied root structures to improve and maintain the soil’s structure, carbon, biology and fertility.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>For the intermediate level only, you must establish and maintain herbal leys with a mixture of grasses, legumes, and herbs on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard. You can maintain an existing herbal ley to meet this.</p>

<p>For this action, you can also use herbal leys located on your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2-metre or 1-metre cross compliance buffers required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-1-establishment-of-buffer-strips-along-watercourses">GAEC 1</a>
</li>
  <li>2-metre cross compliance green cover requirement under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guide-to-cross-compliance-in-england-2022/gaec-7a-boundaries">GAEC 7a</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do this on a single area of land for the duration of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. Alternatively, you can move the area used for the herbal leys around the land parcels entered into this standard each year.</p>

<p>You must not establish herbal leys on any area of land that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is a site of special scientific interest (<abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
  <li>contains historic or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can still enter such land into the intermediate level of this standard, but only if you can establish the required herbal leys on other land that is not an <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> and does not contain historic or archaeological features. In this case, you’ll still be paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the intermediate level of this standard, even though you cannot complete the action on this specific land.</p>

<p>You should not complete this action on any area of ‘peaty soil’. Peaty soil means there’s around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more. You may already know if there is peaty soil on your land. If you do not know, the <abbr title="soil organic matter">SOM</abbr> test results from completing action 2 will tell you. You’ll still be paid for this area, even though you cannot complete the action on it. This is a temporary measure until specific measures on the sustainable management of peaty soils become available.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must establish the herbal ley in the first 12 months of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. If you’ve already established a herbal ley, you can maintain it to meet this action.</p>

<p>You must maintain the herbal ley on at least 15% of the land entered into this level of the standard for the 3-year duration of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-improved-grassland-soils-standard">how to establish and maintain herbal leys</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You should keep photographs and other documentation to show what you’ve done to complete this action. This will help if it’s not clear that you’ve achieved the aim. You must supply this evidence if we ask for it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> moorland standard</h2>

<p>This covers what you need to know to complete the actions in the moorland standard.</p>

<p>You only have to meet a requirement in this standard if the word ‘must’ is used. In this case, it’s part of your Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) standards agreement. The rest of the information is to help you, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>You can understand what you’re agreeing to do by reading this information on the moorland standard, together with your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement document and its terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>How the moorland standard will improve the environment</h3>

<p>Moorland soils and habitats provide a range of benefits to the public (public goods). These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carbon storage, to offset the effects of climate change</li>
  <li>water storage and flow, to reduce the effects of flooding and drought</li>
  <li>biodiversity, to protect plants and wildlife</li>
  <li>heritage, to protect historic and archaeological features</li>
</ul>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard is focused on assessing moorland to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which of these benefits the moorland already provides</li>
  <li>opportunities to maintain or enhance these benefits</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>Eligible land for the moorland standard</h3>

<p>You can only enter land into the moorland standard that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has an eligible ‘land cover’</li>
  <li>is an eligible ‘land type’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Land cover</h4>

<p>Each land parcel has one or more registered land covers. These identify what broad category the land is.</p>

<p>Common land is not shown on your digital maps. You can check the maps we have previously provided to you to check the land cover on the common land. When you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> on common land, you will be able to view the land parcels on a digital map as part of the application process. Before applications open, we’ll publish information on GOV.UK to help you apply on common land.</p>

<p>Read the information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligible-land-covers-and-land-types">which land covers are eligible for the moorland standard</a>.</p>

<p>If a land parcel has one or more of the land covers that are eligible for this standard, it will show as ‘available area’ in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. When you select this land parcel, its total available area is included in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application. You cannot reduce it in your application.</p>

<p>A land parcel’s available area is only eligible for this standard if it is also an eligible land type.</p>

<h4>Land type</h4>

<p>The land type describes the detailed use of a land parcel’s broad category of land cover.</p>

<p>You can enter a land parcel into this standard if its land type is moorland. This means it’s located above the moorland line.</p>

<p>You can check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?chosenLayers=moorIndex,backdropDIndex,backdropIndex,europeIndex,vmlBWIndex,25kBWIndex,50kBWIndex,250kBWIndex,miniscaleBWIndex,baseIndex&amp;box=-1037291:0:1837291:1400000&amp;useDefaultbackgroundMapping=false" rel="external">MAGIC</a> to find out if your land is above the moorland line.</p>

<p>The vegetation of these moorland areas will usually be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>semi-natural moorland habitats including heathland, blanket bog, rough acid grasslands, rushy flushes, swamps, mires and bracken</li>
  <li>upland calcareous grassland</li>
</ul>

<p>If a land parcel is on both sides of the moorland line:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the majority of the land parcel’s area is above the moorland line, you can enter the total area of that land parcel into the moorland standard</li>
  <li>where the majority of the land parcel’s area is below the moorland line, the whole of that land parcel is not eligible for the moorland standard, but may be eligible for the arable and horticultural soils standard or improved grassland soils standards</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some areas of land located above the moorland line that you cannot enter into this standard. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arable land</li>
  <li>farmyards</li>
  <li>permanent crops</li>
  <li>areas used for turf or peat production</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of upland moorland is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered common land, with land owned by one of more parties and rights held by multiple commoners</li>
  <li>shared grazing where graziers have a legal right to graze but the land is not registered as common land</li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="#commons-and-shared-grazing-land">eligibility requirements for common land and shared grazing</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span>Other land eligibility schemes to consider</h3>

<p>You should also consider the following land eligibility issues.</p>

<h5>Other schemes and funding sources</h5>

<p>Land is eligible for this standard if it’s receiving Farming in Protected Landscapes (FIPL) funding or it’s in an existing scheme such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Higher Level Stewardship (<abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because the introductory level of this standard only includes actions not already paid for under FIPL, <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>.</p>

<h5>Scheduled monuments, historic and archaeological features</h5>

<p>If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you must request a Sustainable Farming Incentive Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will tell you about any known historic and archaeological features on your land, including scheduled monuments. It will also tell you how they affect the actions you can take under the standards.</p>

<p>To request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you need to register on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hefer-data.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> portal</a>. The <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will be available when applications open. Once registered, you can request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> by entering your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). You’ll then be sent an email when the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> is available for you to download.</p>

<p>Before you enter land into an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, read more about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/planning/consents/smc" rel="external">scheduled monuments</a>, as you may need consent from Historic England</li>
  <li>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/hpg/consent/cac" rel="external">conservation area</a> which may need consent from your local planning authority</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)</h5>

<p><abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land is eligible for the introductory level of the moorland standard.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that the actions under the introductory level of the moorland standard will be listed operations requiring Natural England consent, it is your responsibility to check. If you intend to complete the actions by carrying out a listed operation within the boundary of the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/request-permission-for-works-or-an-activity-on-an-sssi">give notice to Natural England and get its consent</a> before you carry out any listed operations on the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land.</p>

<p>You can find the listed operations requiring Natural England consent on your <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land by searching for the <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">designated sites system</a> (DSS). You can also find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest#get-consent-to-carry-out-operations-on-your-land">getting consent to carry out operations on <abbr title="Site of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> land</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span>How the moorland standard works</h3>

<p>The moorland standard has a set of aims. You achieve these aims by completing the land actions for this standard. The details of the actions explain what you need to do, when to do it and each action’s aim.</p>

<p>If you enter a land parcel into the moorland standard, it cannot be selected for the other of the 2 standards available in 2022. In future, some standards will be compatible with each other, and you’ll be able to have a land parcel in more than one standard where this is the case.</p>

<h4>Different levels</h4>

<p>The moorland standard only has an introductory level. This level is focused on actions not already in <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> or <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr>, with actions to assess the moorland and produce plans. <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> will continue to fund physical actions. This means you can combine <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>, <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher Level Stewardship">HLS</abbr> to provide an income source.</p>

<p>The introductory level of this standard will work alongside other schemes until 2024. There are a range of options available in <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> for moorland areas, as well as other funding sources, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-farmers-in-protected-landscapes">Farming in Protected Landscapes</a>.</p>

<p>Intermediate and advanced levels of this standard will be added in the future. You’ll be able to upgrade your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement annually to increase levels for existing standards in your agreement.</p>

<h4>Payments</h4>

<p>The total annual payment you receive depends on the number of hectares (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) of eligible land you enter into each level.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Level</th>
      <th scope="col">Total annual payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Introductory</td>

</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Additional moorland payment</td>
      <td>£265 per agreement</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You are paid for all the eligible hectares entered into the standard.</p>

<p>Read more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="#getting-paid">payments</a>.</p>

<h4>When to complete the actions</h4>

<p>Once your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement starts, you should complete the actions in this standard, as explained in the details of the actions under ‘When to do it’.</p>

<h4>Checking progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement</h4>

<p>If we check progress of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you’ll only be asked for evidence of what you’ve done to complete the action if it’s not clear that the aim has been achieved. The details of each action explain what evidence to keep.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span>Summary of the actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>action 1: identify and record the soil and vegetation types and condition, and presence of historic and archaeological features</li>
  <li>action 2: assess the public goods the moorland is already providing</li>
  <li>action 3: identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided by the moorland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.6 </span>Details of the actions</h3>

<p>This section gives details of the actions in the moorland standard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.7 </span>Action 1: Survey the soil, vegetation, historic and archaeological features</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve the action’s aim. The aim is for you to have recorded, across the moorland entered into this standard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the soil types and their condition</li>
  <li>the vegetation types and their condition</li>
  <li>the presence of historic and archaeological features</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help you assess how your moorland contributes to providing public goods and identify opportunities to maintain and enhance them.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must carry out a survey to identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features across the moorland area entered into this standard.</p>

<p>To do this, you must divide the moorland area into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and select a sample point within each block that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is broadly representative of the main vegetation and soil types of the block</li>
  <li>can be accessed and surveyed safely</li>
</ul>

<p>For each sample point, you must identify, assess and record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>soil types and condition, including the depth and wetness of any peat</li>
  <li>vegetation types and condition, including their height and structure</li>
  <li>the extent of bare ground</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also record the presence of historic and archaeological features. These will be identified on the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> you request before you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you’ve previously done a survey of your moorland, you cannot use this survey to meet this action. However, you can use surveys and data produced by other organisations. For example, this could include Ordnance Survey maps and soil survey data.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>In the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement you must identify, assess and record the required information for one sample in each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block, across all the land entered into this standard.</p>

<p>In each subsequent year of your agreement, you must repeat this survey at a different sample point within each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block. Try to do this at about the same time each year.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action, but the survey must sample blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and record the information explained in ‘What to do’.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-moorland-standard">how to survey your moorland</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a record of your survey. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.8 </span>Action 2: Identify public goods the moorland provides</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is for you to have assessed and recorded how the moorland entered into this standard is already providing public goods.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must use the information you’ve collected for action 1 to identify and record public goods your moorland is providing. These public goods include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carbon storage</li>
  <li>water storage and flow</li>
  <li>biodiversity</li>
  <li>heritage</li>
</ul>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>You must use the survey of your moorland for action 1 to identify and record the public goods it provides. You must do this in the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement.</p>

<p>In subsequent years of your agreement, you must review this record and update it where required, based on further surveys completed for action 1.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance on&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-moorland-standard">how to identify the public goods your moorland provides</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a written record of the public goods you’ve identified as already being provided by the moorland. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.9 </span>Action 3: Identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides</h3>

<h4>The action’s aim</h4>

<p>You must achieve this action’s aim. The aim is for you to have identified and recorded the opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided by the moorland entered into this standard.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>

<p>You must use the information collected for actions 1 and 2 to identify and record opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides.</p>

<h4>When to do it</h4>

<p>In the first year of your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement, you must use the information collected for actions 1 and 2 to produce a record of opportunities to maintain and enhance the public goods your moorland provides.</p>

<p>In subsequent years of your agreement, you must review this record and update it where required, based on further information collected under actions 1 and 2.</p>

<h4>How to do it</h4>

<p>It’s up to you how you complete this action.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-do-the-actions-in-the-moorland-standard">how to identify opportunities to maintain or enhance public goods provided by your moorland</a>, but you do not have to follow it.</p>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard focuses on mapping and identifying opportunities to maintain and enhance the public benefits your moorland provides. In future, we expect that there will be funding available to help you carry out activities that maintain and enhance the public benefits provided by your moorland.</p>

<p>These activities are likely to be funded when intermediate and advanced levels are added to the moorland standard. Once these higher levels are available, you should not expect to remain in the introductory level for more than 3 years before upgrading to these higher levels.</p>

<p>You may also be able to apply to other funding sources to support these activities, including private sector schemes.</p>

<h4>What evidence to keep</h4>

<p>You must keep a written record of the opportunities you’ve identified to maintain or enhance public goods provided by your moorland. You must supply this evidence when we ask for it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>How to do the actions in the arable and horticultural soils standard</h2>

<p>This ‘How to’ guide gives advice about how you could complete the actions in this standard. You may find it helpful to read this guide, but you don’t have to follow it. It covers how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test soil organic matter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add organic matter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish green cover over winter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>To complete a soil assessment, you’ll usually need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess soil type, texture, structure and biology</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assess risks to your soil</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify historic features</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to assess the soil and take soil samples when it is not too dry or wet. Spring or autumn are usually the best time of year to complete a soil assessment.</p>

<h4>Assess soil type, structure and biology</h4>

<p>The main soil types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>silt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loam</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chalk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>peat</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about these soil types in the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/characteristics-different-soils" rel="external">characteristics of different soils</a>.</p>

<p>To check the soil type, you can search for your location in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/" rel="external">Soilscapes soil types viewer</a> produced by the National Soil Resources Institute of Cranfield University.</p>

<h4>Soil texture</h4>

<p>Soil texture depends on the mix of sand, silt and clay in the soil.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/32016?category=9001" rel="external">read Natural England’s Technical Information Note about soil texture</a>, which includes the main soil texture types and what you’re likely to feel and see for each texture class.</p>

<h4>Soil structure and compaction</h4>

<p>Soil structure affects how air and water move in the soil and how well crops and grass can grow.</p>

<p>You can choose how you assess soil structure. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>look at the soil surface to assess the quality of the crop or grass sward and identify areas where there may be soil structure issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take a soil sample by digging out a block of soil to a depth of around 30cm (12 inches)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>score the soil sample by visually assessing it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-regulatory-issues-and-consents-that-could-affect-an-sfi-standards-agreement#scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features">checking regulatory issues and consents</a> explains that you must <a class="govuk-link" href="consent-for-soil-sampling-on-scheduled-monuments-sustainable-farming-incentive">get consent from Historic England</a> if you plan to take soil samples on an area containing a scheduled monument. The consent form tells you what depth the soil samples can be.</p>

<h4>Soil biology</h4>

<p>Soil biology includes the presence of earthworms and other visible creatures, soil organic matter and microorganisms.</p>

<p>You can use a soil sample to count earthworms and other visible creatures, such as millipedes and spiders. To do this, you can use the same soil samples taken to assess soil structure and soil organic matter (action 2) or dig another pit.</p>

<p>The soil organic matter testing you do under action 2 will tell you about the soil organic matter.</p>

<p>Microorganisms can be quite difficult to assess yourself, but if you’d like to find out more you can ask a commercial laboratory to test soil samples for this.</p>

<p>To find out more about soil biology, you can read the AHDB factsheet: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IntroSoiBiology_WEB2074_280219.pdf" rel="external">An introduction to Soil Biology</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span>Assess risks relating to soil</h3>

<p>You can assess the risks relating to soil from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>runoff or soil erosion, including connection to water bodies or sensitive habitats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wind erosion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nitrogen leaching</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve assessed these risks you can make an overall assessment of the risk for your land.</p>

<p>You can follow the steps below to assess risks to your soil.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb, meaning that water drains away directly over the surface of land. This can carry fine soil particles, nutrients, pesticides and manures to water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, ditches, stream and rivers. This can cause pollution and potentially harm animals and plants that live in the water bodies.</p>

<p>Runoff can wash material directly from a land parcel into a water body. It can also travel in other ways, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>through yards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>along tracks or roads</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>via field drains</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the risk of runoff and soil erosion, you can consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the gradient of a slope - steeper slopes have a greater risk of runoff and soil erosion as water runs more quickly over the surface</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how long a slope is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soil texture - this affects whether rain soaks into the soil or runs over the surface, and how easily soil particles will be washed away</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how often the land floods - it is more susceptible to erosion and runoff if it floods frequently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how close the land is to a water body</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1a: Assess the gradient of the slope</h4>

<p>You can choose how to measure the gradient of a slope. For example, you could use a clinometer.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high for steep slopes - these are slopes with an angle of 7 degrees or more (12%+ gradient)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>moderate for moderate slopes - slopes with an angle of 3-7 degrees (5-12% gradient)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lower for gentle slopes - slopes with an angle of 2-3 degrees (3-5% gradient)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1b: Assess other runoff and erosion factors</h4>

<p>After you’ve assessed the risk of runoff for each land parcel based on the gradient of the slope, you can adjust the runoff and erosion risk assessment to reflect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>slope length</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soil texture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flooding frequency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>history of runoff or ponding</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, lighter soils on moderate slopes have a high risk of runoff. Land that regularly floods (at least once every 3 years) has a high risk of erosion or runoff.</p>

<h4>Step 1c: Assess how close land is to water</h4>

<p>The risk of runoff may be less significant if the land parcel is not close or well connected to a water body, such as a pond, lake, ditch, stream or river. You can assess the risk of runoff based on how close the land parcel is to a water body.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high – if the land parcel you’re assessing is directly next to a water body</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>moderate – if the land parcel is separated from a water body by at least one other land parcel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lower – if the land parcel is some distance from a water body</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1d: risk based on history of runoff or ponding</h4>

<p>You can then refine the risk assessment for each land parcel based on the history of runoff and ponding. The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high - if visible runoff and ponding happens to the land you’re assessing in most years during wet periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>moderate - if visible runoff happens in most years during wet periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lower - if runoff happens occasionally during wet periods</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1e: refine your risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Once you’ve considered the risks above, you can use your experience and judgement to adjust the level of risk for each land parcel, taking into account additional factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>soil structure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organic matter content - higher organic content usually increases the ability of soil to absorb water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>valley features, as they tend to concentrate runoff water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>long unbroken slopes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>land use</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Risk of wind erosion</h4>

<p>Wind erosion is most likely on fine sandy soils and light peaty soils. It will be worse in dry conditions or where there is drainage, bare land or fine dry seedbeds.</p>

<p>Signs of wind erosion include drifting soil, buried seedlings, and soil blown into hedgerows, ditches and onto nearby roads.</p>

<p>If there are fine sandy soils or light peaty soils and wind erosion occurs at least once every 3 years, identify this area as high risk in your soil assessment. If there are chalk or limestone soils, the risk is likely to be moderate. Other soil types are likely to be lower risk.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Risk of nitrogen leaching</h4>

<p>Light sandy and shallow soils are less able to store nitrogen. It can be easily lost as water filters through the soil. If you have land parcels with this type of soil where you add nitrogen-based fertilisers, identify this as being at risk of nitrogen leaching.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Make an overall risk assessment</h4>

<p>Once you’ve assessed all the risks above, and made any adjustments you judge are relevant, you can make your overall risk assessment for your land. You can do this by classifying the overall risks as very high, high, moderate or lower. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if there are a number of high risks, it’s likely to be an overall very high risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are some high risks, some mediums and a few lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall high risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are mainly medium and lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall medium risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are mainly lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall lower risk</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span>How to produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>You can use your soil assessment to record information in your soil management plan. This will help you plan how to manage your land parcels to improve soil health and reduce the risks you identified in your soil assessment.</p>

<h4>Information you can record in the soil management plan</h4>

<p>You can record information in your plan for each land parcel or area where the soils and slopes differ, as identified during your soil assessment. The information you record in your soil management plan could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>soil type, structure and composition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risks and problems that need to be addressed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you currently manage the area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proposed management actions to improve soil health</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Championing the Farmed Environment (CFE) has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cfeonline.org.uk/environmental-management/soils/uk-soil-health-initiative-guides/" rel="external">some helpful guides about managing soils for a range of farming systems</a> which may help with your proposed management actions to improve soil health.</p>

<p>If you have land with known historic or archaeological features, you can record these in your plan. This will inform how you manage land above and around these features.</p>

<p>You can find out about any known historic or archaeological features when you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>. If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<h4>How to record your soil management plan</h4>

<p>You can choose how to record a soil management plan. For example, you could use a map or spreadsheet to record the information. You can choose to record the plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>This table is an example of how you could choose to record a soil management plan.</p>

<h4>Review your soil management plan each year</h4>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard requires that you review your soil management plan each year, update it to take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>new soil analysis you undertake, including soil organic matter testing under action 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new risks or continuing issues identified in your land parcels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>updated proposed management actions for the forthcoming year</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<p>Testing soil organic matter will help you assess the health of your soil. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take soil samples</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analyse the soil samples, which will usually be done by a commercial laboratory</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to select a sample area</h4>

<p>Before you take soil samples, you’ll need to select your sample areas. A sample area is an area of land across which you will take soil samples.</p>

<p>When you select sample areas, try to choose areas which have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a similar soil type</li>
  <li>been managed in a similar way in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>If the soil type and past management is similar, you can take account of the size of the land parcels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select one sample area in each land parcel if you consider the land parcels to be an average size</li>
  <li>select a number of smaller sample areas within a large land parcel</li>
  <li>combine small land parcels into a single sample area, but try to avoid the combined area being too large as this will reduce the soil testing analysis accuracy</li>
</ul>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard requires that the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard has been tested for soil organic matter within the last 5 years. If you combine a number of small land parcels into a single sample area, you can meet this requirement by taking soil from each land parcel and combining it into a single sample for testing.</p>

<h4>When to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You may find it easier to take soil samples in the spring or autumn, before you cultivate the land. This will also avoid damaging the crop.</p>

<p>It is advisable to avoid taking soil samples if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the soil is waterlogged or very dry, because it may reduce the quality of the soil analysis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manure or slurry has been applied within around the last 3 months, as it may affect the soil organic matter levels and give you a false result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You can take multiple soil samples on each sample area and combine them into a single sample that represents the soil across each sample area.</p>

<p>You can choose how many soil samples you take in each sample area, but try to take enough to gain a good understanding of the soil organic matter across each sample area.</p>

<p>Avoid taking soil samples on areas of land where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are historical or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>features like manure heaps, pylons, gateways, headlands and around trees, as these features can distort the soil analysis results</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To get a representative sample of the sample area you’re testing, aim to take cores up to a depth of around 15cm (6 inches).</p>

<p>The information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-regulatory-issues-and-consents-that-could-affect-an-sfi-standards-agreement#scheduled-monuments-historic-and-archaeological-features">checking regulatory issues and consents</a> explains that you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consent-for-soil-sampling-on-scheduled-monuments-sustainable-farming-incentive">get consent from Historic England</a> if you plan to take soil samples on an area containing a scheduled monument. The consent form tells you what depth the soil samples can be.</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to take soil samples for soil organic matter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sample area, with 5-7 stops along each leg of the ‘W’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will give you around 25 soil samples across the sample area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combine the soil samples in a clean plastic bag, to form one bulk sample of about 0.5kg.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to assess the soil structure and soil biology (for action 1), at 5 to 10 stops across the whole ‘W’ you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess topsoil structure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>count and record earthworms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also assess the subsoil structure at 3 of the stops, one of which should be on a headland.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/how-to-collect-a-soil-sample" rel="external">how to collect a soil sample</a>.</p>

<p>The image below shows how you can walk a ‘W’ and take soil samples across a sample area.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Illustration showing how to take soil samples in a 'W' shape across a field." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151496/soil_sampling.svg"></div></figure>

<h4>How to test the soil samples</h4>

<p>If you have the right equipment and expertise, you can test the soil samples yourself. However, sending your soil samples to a commercial laboratory will usually give more accurate results. You can find a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-and-forage-testing-companies" rel="external">laboratories where you can send your soil samples</a> on the AHDB website.</p>

<p>Try to use the same laboratory and method of testing if you are repeating the tests over a number of years. Having a consistent approach will help you see how the soil organic matter is increasing or decreasing over time.</p>

<p>If you use a laboratory, you can ask them to test organic matter content by using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>loss on ignition test (as a minimum level of analysis)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dumas test, which uses dry combustion to burn the samples</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.5 </span>Action 3: Add organic matter</h3>

<p>To add organic matter to the soil, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>apply organic manure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use green manures, catch crops or cover crops</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chop or leave, or incorporate, straw</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introduce grass or herbal leys into an arable rotation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include legume species or legume rich mixes in rotations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When choosing how you will add organic matter, consider the soil type and risks you’ve identified in your soil assessment for action 1 in this standard.</p>

<p>You may also find it helpful to read the AHDB Great Soils factsheet about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/adding-organic-matter-to-soil" rel="external">adding organic matter to soil</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of organic manure you apply, you may need to read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sewage-sludge-in-agriculture-code-of-practice">sewage sludge in agriculture: code of practice</a> and check if you need <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/290130/LIT_5492_40c081.pdf" rel="external">a land spreading permit</a>.</p>

<p>When choosing how you will add organic matter, consider the soil type and risks you’ve identified in your soil assessment for action 1 in this standard.</p>

<p>You may also find it helpful to read the AHDB GreatSoils factsheet about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/adding-organic-matter-to-soil" rel="external">adding organic matter to soil</a>.</p>

<h4>Peaty soil</h4>

<p>If the soil type is peaty, the arable and horticultural soils standard requires that you should not complete this action because adding organic matter can speed up peat decomposition. Peaty soil means there is around 20% or more organic matter to a depth of 40cm or more.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.6 </span>Action 4: Winter cover</h3>

<p>You can use crops or vegetation that provide a green cover to protect bare soil over the winter. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>autumn-sown crops such as winter cereals, linseed and oilseed rape</li>
  <li>a quick-growing cover crop, including green manures</li>
  <li>leaving weedy stubbles that give sufficient cover to protect the soil</li>
</ul>

<p>The crops or vegetation you choose need to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>suitable for winter sowing</li>
  <li>fast growing</li>
  <li>frost tolerant to provide adequate cover over winter</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re using a quick-growing cover crop, you may find it helpful to read the AHDB <a class="govuk-link" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IS41%20Opportunities%20for%20cover%20crops%20in%20conventional%20arable-rotations%20(2018).pdf" rel="external">information sheet about cover crops</a>.</p>

<p>If you enter land into the intermediate level of the arable and horticultural soils standard, you’ll need to include multi-species cover crops on the required (20%) area of land entered into this level of the standard.</p>

<p>Multi-species cover crops are a sown mix of plant species grown together on the same area of land to protect the soil and improve its health. You may find it helpful to read the&nbsp;AHDB <a class="govuk-link" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IS41%20Opportunities%20for%20cover%20crops%20in%20conventional%20arable-rotations%20(2018).pdf" rel="external">information sheet about cover crops</a>.</p>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard explains that as a minimum, the multi-species cover crops must include a mix of at least two species from one or more of these plant families:</p>

<ul>
  <li>brassica</li>
  <li>legume</li>
  <li>grass or cereal</li>
  <li>herbs</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose any mix that works for your farm. Choosing a varied mix (with multiple species from different plant families and with different characteristics) will normally bring greater benefits to your soil.</p>

<h4>How to establish winter cover</h4>

<p>To achieve a well-established winter cover with leafy vegetation to protect the soil from the start of December, you may want to establish it in late summer or early autumn.</p>

<p>If you’re in an area with a shorter growing season you may need to choose plants that germinate and grow in cooler weather.</p>

<p>The image below gives an example of well-established green cover at the start of the winter months.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Image of a green field with some brown patches of soil and partridges in the foreground." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151499/Well_established_winter_crop_with_partridge_in_foreground.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Credit: Cindy Hughes, Defra.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The image below gives an example of very well-established, multi-species winter green cover.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Image of well established green plants covering the ground." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151497/Well_established_green_cover.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Credit: Tom Hicks, Natural England.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>If you’re using weedy stubbles for winter cover, to meet the requirement in the arable and horticultural soils standard they need to give sufficient cover to protect the soil. This is likely to be the case if the stubbles follow the harvest of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>barley</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>canary seed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>oats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>red millet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rye</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>triticale</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wheat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>white millet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>linseed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>oilseed rape</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quinoa</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to destroy winter cover</h4>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard requires you to retain the winter cover until the end of February, unless you’re planting an early-sown spring crop.</p>

<p>How you destroy the winter cover is up to you. You can graze your cover crop with livestock and incorporate it into your soils to increase organic matter (this also counts towards action 3 in the arable and horticultural soils standard).</p>

<p>Avoid using heavy machinery, or heavy grazing, on wet soils to destroy the winter cover as this can cause soil compaction.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>How to do the actions in the improved grassland soils standard</h2>

<p>This ‘How to’ guide gives advice about how you could complete the actions in this standard. You may find it helpful to read this guide, but you don’t have to follow it. It covers how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test soil organic matter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimise bare ground over winter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish and maintain herbal leys</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>Action 1: Complete a soil assessment and produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>To complete a soil assessment, you’ll usually need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess soil type, texture, structure and biology</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assess risks to your soil</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify historic features</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Try to assess the soil and take soil samples when it is not too dry or wet. Spring or autumn are usually the best time of year to complete a soil assessment.</p>

<h4>Assess soil type, structure and biology</h4>

<p>The main soil types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>silt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loam</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chalk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>peat</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about these soil types in the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/characteristics-different-soils" rel="external">characteristics of different soils</a>.</p>

<p>To check the soil type, you can search for your location in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/" rel="external">Soilscapes soil types viewer</a> produced by the National Soil Resources Institute of Cranfield University.</p>

<h4>Soil texture</h4>

<p>Soil texture depends on the mix of sand, silt and clay in the soil.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/32016?category=9001" rel="external">read Natural England’s Technical Information Note about soil texture</a>, which includes the main soil texture types and what you’re likely to feel and see for each texture class.</p>

<h4>Soil structure and compaction</h4>

<p>Soil structure affects how air and water move in the soil and how well crops and grass can grow.</p>

<p>You can choose how you assess soil structure. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>look at the soil surface to assess the quality of the crop or grass sward and identify areas where there may be soil structure issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take a soil sample by digging out a block of soil to a depth of around 30cm (12 inches)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>score the soil sample by visually assessing it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Environment Agency’s ‘think soils’ guide to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/ThinkSoils.pdf#page=50" rel="external">identifying soil structural problems in the field</a>

</ul>

<p>It may save time if you assess soil structure when you <a class="govuk-link" href="#test-som">test soil organic matter</a>.</p>

<h4>Soil biology</h4>

<p>Soil biology includes the presence of earthworms and other visible creatures, soil organic matter and microorganisms.</p>

<p>You can use a soil sample to count earthworms and other visible creatures, such as millipedes and spiders. To do this, you can use the same soil samples taken to assess soil structure and soil organic matter (action 2) or dig another pit.</p>

<p>The soil organic matter testing you do under action 2 will tell you about the soil organic matter.</p>

<p>Microorganisms can be quite difficult to assess yourself, but if you’d like to find out more you can ask a commercial laboratory to test soil samples for this.</p>

<p>To find out more about soil biology, you can read the AHDB factsheet: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://projectblue.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Imported%20Publication%20Docs/IntroSoiBiology_WEB2074_280219.pdf" rel="external">An introduction to Soil Biology</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>Assess risks relating to soil</h3>

<p>You can assess the risks relating to soil from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>runoff or soil erosion, including connection to water bodies or sensitive habitats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wind erosion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nitrogen leaching</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve assessed these risks you can make an overall assessment of the risk for your land.</p>

<p>You can follow the steps below to assess risks to your soil.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Runoff occurs when there is more water than land can absorb, meaning that water drains away directly over the surface of land. This can carry fine soil particles, nutrients, pesticides and manures to water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, ditches, stream and rivers. This can cause pollution and potentially harm animals and plants that live in the water bodies.</p>

<p>Runoff can wash material directly from a land parcel into a water body. It can also travel in other ways, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>through yards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>along tracks or roads</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>via field drains</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess the risk of runoff and soil erosion, you can consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the gradient of a slope - steeper slopes have a greater risk of runoff and soil erosion as water runs more quickly over the surface</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how long a slope is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soil texture - this affects whether rain soaks into the soil or runs over the surface, and how easily soil particles will be washed away</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how often the land floods - it is more susceptible to erosion and runoff if it floods frequently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how close the land is to a water body</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1a: Assess the gradient of the slope</h4>

<p>You can choose how to measure the gradient of a slope. For example, you could use a clinometer.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high for steep slopes - these are slopes with an angle of 7 degrees or more (12%+ gradient)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>moderate for moderate slopes - slopes with an angle of 3-7 degrees (5-12% gradient)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lower for gentle slopes - slopes with an angle of 2-3 degrees (3-5% gradient)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1b: Assess other runoff and erosion factors</h4>

<p>After you’ve assessed the risk of runoff for each land parcel based on the gradient of the slope, you can adjust the runoff and erosion risk assessment to reflect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>slope length</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>soil texture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>flooding frequency</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>history of runoff or ponding</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, lighter soils on moderate slopes have a high risk of runoff. Land that regularly floods (at least once every 3 years) has a high risk of erosion or runoff.</p>

<h4>Step 1c: Assess how close land is to water</h4>

<p>The risk of runoff may be less significant if the land parcel is not close or well connected to a water body, such as a pond, lake, ditch, stream or river. You can assess the risk of runoff based on how close the land parcel is to a water body.</p>

<p>The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high – if the land parcel you’re assessing is directly next to a water body</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>moderate – if the land parcel is separated from a water body by at least one other land parcel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lower – if the land parcel is some distance for land from a water body</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1d: risk based on history of runoff or ponding</h4>

<p>You can then refine the risk assessment for each land parcel based on the history of runoff and ponding. The risk of runoff is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>high - if visible runoff and ponding happens to the land you’re assessing in most years during wet periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>moderate - if visible runoff happens in most years during wet periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lower - if runoff happens occasionally during wet periods</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1e: refine your risk of runoff and soil erosion</h4>

<p>Once you’ve considered the risks above, you can use your experience and judgement to adjust the level of risk for each land parcel, taking into account additional factors such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>soil structure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>organic matter content - higher organic content usually increases the ability of soil to absorb water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>valley features, as they tend to concentrate runoff water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>long unbroken slopes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>land use</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Risk of wind erosion</h4>

<p>Wind erosion is most likely on fine sandy soils and light peaty soils. It will be worse in dry conditions or where there is drainage, bare land or fine dry seedbeds.</p>

<p>Signs of wind erosion include drifting soil, buried seedlings, and soil blown into hedgerows, ditches and onto nearby roads.</p>

<p>If there are fine sandy soils or light peaty soils and wind erosion occurs at least once every 3 years, identify this area as high risk in your soil assessment. If there are chalk or limestone soils, the risk is likely to be moderate. Other soil types are likely to be lower risk.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Risk of nitrogen leaching</h4>

<p>Light sandy and shallow soils are less able to store nitrogen. It can be easily lost as water filters through the soil. If you have land parcels with this type of soil where you add nitrogen-based fertilisers, identify this as being at risk of nitrogen leaching.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Make an overall risk assessment</h4>

<p>Once you’ve assessed all the risks above, and made any adjustments you judge are relevant, you can make your overall risk assessment for your land. You can do this by classifying the overall risks as very high, high, moderate or lower. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if there are a number of high risks, it’s likely to be an overall very high risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are some high risks, some mediums and a few lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall high risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are mainly medium and lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall medium risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are mainly lower risks, it’s likely to be an overall lower risk</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span>How to produce a soil management plan</h3>

<p>You can use your soil assessment to record information in your soil management plan. This will help you plan how to manage your land parcels to improve soil health and reduce the risks you identified in your soil assessment.</p>

<h4>Information you can record in the soil management plan</h4>

<p>You can record information in your plan for each land parcel or area where the soils and slopes differ, as identified during your soil assessment. The information you record in your soil management plan could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>soil type, structure and composition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risks and problems that need to be addressed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you currently manage the area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proposed management actions to improve soil health</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Championing the Farmed Environment (CFE) has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cfeonline.org.uk/environmental-management/soils/uk-soil-health-initiative-guides/" rel="external">some helpful guides about managing soils for a range of farming systems</a> which may help with your proposed management actions to improve soil health.</p>

<p>If you have land with known historic or archaeological features, you can record these in your plan. This will inform how you manage land above and around these features.</p>

<p>You can find out about any known historic or archaeological features when you apply for <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>. If you select a land parcel in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application that contains a scheduled monument, historic or archaeological feature, you will be told that you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<h4>How to record your soil management plan</h4>

<p>You can choose how to record a soil management plan. For example, you could use a map or spreadsheet to record the information. You can choose to record the plan on paper or digitally.</p>

<p>This table is an example of how you could choose to record a soil management plan.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Field or part field reference&nbsp;</th>
      <th scope="col">Field details</th>

<h4>Review your soil management plan each year</h4>

<p>The arable and horticultural soils standard requires that you review your soil management plan each year, update it to take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>new soil analysis you undertake, including soil organic matter testing under action 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new risks or continuing issues identified in your land parcels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>updated proposed management actions for the forthcoming year</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.4 </span>Action 2: Test soil organic matter</h3>

<p>Testing soil organic matter will help you assess the health of your soil. To do this, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take soil samples</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analyse the soil samples, which will usually be done by a commercial laboratory</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to select a sample area</h4>

<p>Before you take soil samples, you’ll need to select your sample areas. A sample area is an area of land across which you will take soil samples.</p>

<p>When you select sample areas, try to choose areas which have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a similar soil type</li>
  <li>been managed in a similar way in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>If the soil type and past management is similar, you can take account of the size of the land parcels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select one sample area in each land parcel if you consider the land parcels to be an average size</li>
  <li>select a number of smaller sample areas within a large land parcel</li>
  <li>combine small land parcels into a single sample area, but try to avoid the combined area being too large as this will reduce the soil testing analysis accuracy</li>
</ul>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard requires that the soil for all the land parcels entered into this standard has been tested for soil organic matter within the last 5 years. If you combine a number of small land parcels into a single sample area, you can meet this requirement by taking soil from each land parcel and combining it into a single sample for testing.</p>

<h4>When to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You may find it easier to take soil samples in the spring or autumn, before you cultivate the land. This will also avoid damaging the crop.</p>

<p>It is advisable to avoid taking soil samples if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the soil is waterlogged or very dry, because it may reduce the quality of the soil analysis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manure or slurry has been applied within around the last 3 months, as it may affect the soil organic matter levels and give you a false result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to take soil samples</h4>

<p>You can take multiple soil samples on each sample area and combine them into a single sample that represents the soil across each sample area.</p>

<p>You can choose how many soil samples you take in each sample area, but try to take enough to gain a good understanding of the soil organic matter across each sample area.</p>

<p>Avoid taking soil samples on areas of land where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are historical or archaeological features, as identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>features like manure heaps, pylons, gateways, headlands and around trees, as these features can distort the soil analysis results</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To get a representative sample of the sample area you’re testing, aim to take cores up to a depth of around 15cm (6 inches).</p>

<p>You can follow these steps to take soil samples for soil organic matter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Walk a ‘W’ pattern across the sample area, with 5-7 stops along each leg of the ‘W’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This will give you around 25 soil samples across the sample area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Combine the soil samples in a clean plastic bag, to form one bulk sample of about 0.5kg.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to assess the soil structure and soil biology (for action 1), at 5 to 10 stops across the whole ‘W’ you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>assess topsoil structure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>count and record earthworms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also assess the subsoil structure at 3 of the stops, one of which should be on a headland.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/how-to-collect-a-soil-sample" rel="external">how to collect a soil sample</a>.</p>

<p>The image below shows how you can walk a ‘W’ and take soil samples across a sample area.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Illustration showing how to take soil samples in a 'W' shape across a field." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151496/soil_sampling.svg"></div></figure>

<h4>How to test the soil samples</h4>

<p>If you have the right equipment and expertise, you can test the soil samples yourself. However, sending your soil samples to a commercial laboratory will usually give more accurate results. You can find a list of&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/soil-and-forage-testing-companies" rel="external">laboratories where you can send your soil samples</a> on the AHDB website.</p>

<p>Try to use the same laboratory and method of testing if you are repeating the tests over a number of years. Having a consistent approach will help you see how the soil organic matter is increasing or decreasing over time.</p>

<p>If you use a laboratory, you can ask them to test organic matter content by using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>loss on ignition test (as a minimum level of analysis)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dumas test, which uses dry combustion to burn the samples</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.5 </span>Action 3: Minimise bare ground over winter</h3>

<h4>How to minimise bare ground over winter</h4>

<p>There are various ways you can minimise bare ground, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring early establishment of reseeded grassland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>preventing livestock poaching wet ground</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoiding localised poaching around gateways and when supplementary feeding livestock</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How to ensure early establishment of reseeded grassland</h4>

<p>To ensure early establishment of reseeded grassland, you can cultivate the land parcel in the spring and summer rather than autumn.</p>

<p>Reseeding grassland in the spring will usually mean there are better conditions for the grass to establish, with sufficient soil moisture to support germination of the grass seeds.</p>

<p>Before reseeding, you may choose to address any subsoil compaction or surface capping.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read the AHDB’s guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/grassland-reseeding" rel="external">grassland reseeding</a>.</p>

<h4>How to prevent livestock poaching wet ground</h4>

<p>To prevent livestock poaching wet ground, you can move them regularly or reduce the number of livestock grazing an area of land.</p>

<p>You can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a dense sward to protect the soil and minimise the formation of bare patches</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide hard standing around permanent feeders, water troughs and in gateways regularly used by livestock</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may find it helpful to read AHDB’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/tips-for-on-off-grazing-to-avoid-poaching" rel="external">tips for on/off grazing to avoid poaching</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/tips-for-on-off-grazing-to-avoid-poaching" rel="external">tips for on/off grazing to avoid poaching</a>.</p>

<h4>How to avoid localised poaching</h4>

<p>You can move supplementary feeders and water troughs regularly to avoid localised poaching by livestock. If there are historic features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>, you can try to supplementary feed at least 6m away from those features, where possible.</p>

<p>You can also try to make sure that farm vehicles use established tracks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.6 </span>Action 4: Establish and maintain herbal leys</h3>

<h4>How to establish herbal leys</h4>

<p>The correct seed mix is vital to growing a high-quality herbal ley. Your seed supplier can help you choose a seed mix that is the best match for your land, local conditions and how you’ll manage the ley.</p>

<p>You can choose what mix of grasses, legumes and herbs to use in the herbal ley. A high-quality herbal ley will usually include at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>5 species of grass, such as cocksfoot, festulolium, meadow fescue, perennial ryegrass, smooth-stalked meadow grass, tall fescue and timothy)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3 species of legumes, such as bird’s-foot-trefoil, lucerne, red clover, sainfoin winter vetch and common vetch, and black medick</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>5 species of herbs, such as burnet, chicory, ribwort plantain and yarrow</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid festulolium and perennial ryegrass combined making up more than 70% by weight of the total seed mix.</p>

<p>The improved grassland soils standard requires that you don’t establish herbal leys on any area that is a site of special scientific interest, or historic or archaeological features identified on your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>.</p>

<h4>How to maintain herbal leys</h4>

<p>You can maintain herbal leys by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grazing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cutting</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Between the start of May and the end of July, you can rest the herbal leys from cutting and grazing for a period of at least 5 weeks. This allows the flowers to open and provide a source of pollen and nectar for insects.</p>

<p>It can take up to 4 years for the roots to grow enough to improve soil structure and fertility.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>How to do the actions in the moorland standard</h2>

<p>This ‘How to’ guide gives advice about how you could complete the actions in this standard.&nbsp;You may find it helpful to read this guide, but you don’t have to follow it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.1 </span>What this guide covers</h3>

<p>This guide covers how to assess a wide range of moorland features, some of which will be relevant to the moorland you are surveying.&nbsp;This largely depends on what type of soil is present.</p>

<p>The main steps in assessing your moorland are summarised below.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Select your sample points</h4>

<p>Divide your moorland into around 10 hectare (<abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr>) blocks and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, identify, assess the condition (where relevant) and:</p>

<p>For all soils, record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>presence or non-presence of peat (and depth of peat if it is present)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extent of bare ground</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extent of erosion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>roughness of ground surface</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>presence of historic and archaeological features</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>presence of additional features such as trees, scrub, bracken and artificial drainage</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have peat soils, also record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>wetness of peat soil</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>presence of peat-forming bog mosses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>range of peatland plants</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have non-peat soils (or soils with minimal peat), also record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>overall average height of tall or woody vegetation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>overall average height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Assess public goods</h4>

<p>Use the information from Step 2 to assess the public goods already provided by the moorland.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Identify potential opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides</h4>

<p>Use the information from steps 2 and 3 to identify potential opportunities to improve the condition of the features to maintain or enhance delivery of the public goods provided by the moorland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.2 </span>How to prepare to do the survey of the moorland</h3>

<p>The best time to survey moorland is between mid-July and the end of October. This avoids the main bird breeding season (March to mid-July).</p>

<p>Birds, nests and eggs are protected by law. If you see signs of nesting birds, you should delay the survey until the birds fledge.</p>

<p>Try to avoid doing the survey after periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.3 </span>Step 1: Select your sample points</h3>

<p>Before you survey the moorland, the moorland standard requires that you divide the moorland area into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> and select a sample point within each block.</p>

<p>At each sample point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features (action 1 of the introductory level of the moorland standard)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify public goods the moorland is already providing (action 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides (action 3)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To select your sample points, you may find it helpful to use a paper or digital Ordnance Survey (OS) map of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>1:10,000 scale</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1:25,000 scale, which shows contours</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can overlay the OS map with a grid to split the moorland into blocks of around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> (for example 200m x 500m rectangular blocks). If possible, try to make the blocks equally-sized.</p>

<p>The moorland standard requires that each 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is surveyed at a different sample point each year of your 3-year <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement. You can therefore consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>splitting the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks into 3 smaller areas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>selecting a sample point within each of the 3 smaller areas that broadly represents the main vegetation and soil types within the 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>numbering each sample point on the OS map, to help you identify where your observations were taken</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Select sample points that you can access safely to complete the survey.</p>

<p>The image below shows an OS map divided into around 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> blocks, and a plan for how to assess each block over a three year period.</p>

<p>You may also find it helpful to look at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?chosenLayers=moorIndex,soilscapeIndex,backdropDIndex,backdropIndex,europeIndex,vmlBWIndex,25kBWIndex,50kBWIndex,250kBWIndex,miniscaleBWIndex,baseIndex,calamingrassIndex,bapcfgmarshIndex,goodgrassIndex,baplcgrassIndex,bapldacidgrassIndex,baplowmeadIndex,bappmg_rushpastIndex,bapucgrassIndex,bapuhmeadIndex,baplowheathIndex,mountheathIndex,bapupheathIndex,moorlandchng1819,limestonepavIndex,bapbbogIndex,bapfensIndex,baplrbogIndex,bapreedbedIndex,uplandswampIndex,fragheathIndex,grassmoorIndex&amp;box=-492935:9511:1127666:807463&amp;useDefaultbackgroundMapping=false" rel="external">MAGIC website</a> to help you choose your sample points. This link opens a map with a moorland line layer (in purple)’</p>

<h4>Other information to help you prepare for the survey</h4>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, you will be told if you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>). To prepare for the survey, you can use the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> map to identify historic and archaeological features on your OS map.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.4 </span>Step 2: Carry out the survey at each sample point</h3>

<p>You can keep a record of your survey on paper or digitally. You may also find it helpful to have a camera with you to take photographs.</p>

<p>At each sample point, take a short walk around it to confirm the main vegetation and soil types broadly represent the surrounding area.</p>

<p>You should choose a different sample point if the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>main vegetation and soil types are not broadly representative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>selected sample point is not safe to survey</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the whole 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block is unsafe to survey, record that it was unsafe and move to the next 10 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> block.</p>

<p>At each sample point, record the unique number you have given it and identify, assess and record the information required.</p>

<p>You may choose to take photographs at each sample point of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the vegetation at your feet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the surrounding area, including historic and archaeological features</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>What to survey at each sample point</h4>

<p>At each sample point, the moorland standard requires that you identify, assess and record the soil, vegetation and historic and archaeological features. This will help you assess the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>public goods these are providing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods provided</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The environmental public goods provided by moorland include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>carbon storage and capture, to offset the effects of climate change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water storage and flow, to reduce the effects of flooding and drought</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clean water, to maintain or enhance water quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>biodiversity, to protect plants and wildlife</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>heritage, to protect historic and archaeological features</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Table 1 explains what you can assess and record at each sample point that affect these environmental public goods.</p>

<p>There may be some additional features around the sample point that could affect the public goods the moorland provides. It may be helpful to record these as part of your survey. They include trees and scrub, bracken, drains and gullies and rock and scree.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.5 </span>Step 2(a): How to survey the features relevant to all soil types</h3>

<p>At each sample point, you can survey the following features on both peat and non-peat soils.</p>

<h4>Presence and depth of peat</h4>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the presence of peat and measure its depth. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You can use the thin rod or cane to probe the soil for the presence of peat, and its depth. Push it vertically into the soil until you feel resistance or to a depth of more than 40cm.</p>

<p>You can record the soil type as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>non-peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of less than 5cm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shallow peat if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of between 5-40cm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>deep peat - if the thin rod or cane meets resistance at a depth of over 40cm</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If there is existing data available on presence of peat and its depth, this can be used as an alternative to probing the soil.</p>

<p>You should avoid probing the soil on areas where there are historical or archaeological features.&nbsp;Your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr> will help you identify such areas.</p>

<h4>Extent of bare ground</h4>

<p>Bare ground is prone to erosion and can emit CO2 to the atmosphere as organic matter decomposes. Minimal bare ground helps protect against this. You can assess the extent of bare ground by looking at the overall position across the sample point.</p>

<h4>Table 3: record the extent of bare ground</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">The extent of bare ground</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Current assessment of public good</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Mainly large, obvious patches of bare peat or soil</td>
      <td>Carbon storage: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mainly small patches (less than 20cm) of bare ground amongst thin or newly established vegetation</td>
      <td>Carbon storage: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>No obvious patches of bare peat or soil</td>
      <td>Carbon storage: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Extent of erosion</h4>

<p>Obvious signs of erosion include rills and gullies on exposed areas, particularly if they’re linked to water bodies.</p>

<p>Erosion features could include vehicle tracks and footpaths. These concentrate water flow, for example, on steep slopes.</p>

<p>You can assess the extent of erosion by looking at the overall position in the area around the sample point.</p>

<h4>Table 4: Record erosion</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Extent of erosion&nbsp;</th>
      <th scope="col">Current assessment of public good</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Large obvious patches of actively eroding bare peat or soil</td>
      <td>Clean water: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small obvious patches of bare peat or soil</td>
      <td>Clean water: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>No obvious patches of bare ground or erosion</td>
      <td>Clean water: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Roughness of ground surface</h4>

<p>If the ground surface is rough this helps to slow the flow of water by holding it back from watercourses. This allows more water to evaporate or infiltrate the soil.</p>

<p>You can walk around the sample point to assess the roughness of ground surface.</p>

<h4>Table 5: how to record the roughness of ground surface</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Roughness of ground surface</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Current public good assessment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Smooth grass, bare ground or carpet moss</td>
      <td>Storage and flow of water: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>No bare ground or sparse bare ground, with at least the occasional hummocks of moss</td>
      <td>Storage and flow of water: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Frequent hummocks of moss or tussocks of grass or bracken</td>
      <td>Storage and flow of water: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Historic or archaeological features</h4>

<p>In your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> application, you will be told if you need to request an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> Historic Environment Farm Environment Record (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>).</p>

<p>This will help you to identify and assess historic or archaeological features on, under or around the sample points.</p>

<p>You can also record any such features that you already know of or that you observe when assessing the sample point that aren’t in your <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> <abbr title="Historic Environment Farm Environment Record">HEFER</abbr>.</p>

<p>You can record any risks to the condition of the historic or archaeological features, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the presence of any trees, scrub or bracken on or next to the feature</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any activity by livestock on or next to the feature that disturbs the soil, causes erosion or compacts the ground</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>land management practices that disturb the soil, cause erosion or compact the ground, such as use of vehicle tracks or heavy machinery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>burrowing animals, such as badgers or rabbits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional features</h4>

<p>There may be some additional features around the sample point that could affect the public goods the moorland provides. It may be helpful to record these as part of your survey. For example, you could record additional features within about 100 metres of each sample point.</p>

<p>These additional features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>trees and scrub, which you can record as none, scattered trees/saplings and/or scrub, dense scrub, woodland or a mix of trees/scrub/woodland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bracken, which you can record as none, more than 50% canopy cover with some litter, more than 50% canopy cover with dense litter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drains and gullies, which you can record as none, channels mainly bare along base, channel base more than 50% vegetation, channel is blocked</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rock and scree which you can record as none, rock outcrops e.g. crags and tors, scree and boulder fields, limestone pavement.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.6 </span>Step 2(b): How to survey the features relevant to peat soils</h3>

<p>If you have identified peat soils, you can survey the following features.</p>

<h4>Wetness of peat soils</h4>

<p>The wetness affects the peat soil’s capacity to store carbon.</p>

<p>You can assess the wetness by a visual assessment and using the thin rod or cane you used to assess the presence and depth of peat.</p>

<h4>Table 6: how to record the wetness of peat soils</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Wetness of peat soils</th>
      <th scope="col">Current public good assessment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Dry or firm peat – no peat sticks to the thin rod or cane</td>
      <td>Carbon storage: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Moist peat - the area looks damp on the surface and the thin rod or cane is moist when removed from the peat</td>
      <td>Carbon storage: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wet peat - if there is standing water or water appears when you press the peat with your foot</td>
      <td>Carbon storage: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Peat-forming bog mosses</h4>

<p>Bog mosses hold water and are very important to the formation of peat.</p>

<p>You can assess the presence of peat-forming bog mosses by looking at the overall position across the sample point.</p>

<h4>Table 7: record presence of peat-forming bog mosses</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;How many peat-forming bog mosses</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Current public goods assessment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Absent or sparse</td>
      <td>Carbon capture, clean water, water storage and flow, biodiversity: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Present in patches</td>
      <td>Carbon capture, clean water, water storage and flow, biodiversity: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Abundant</td>
      <td>Carbon capture, clean water, water storage and flow, biodiversity: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Range of peatland plants</h4>

<p>In addition to bog mosses, moorland peatland is characterised by the presence of a range of other peatland plants. Drier peat will usually have a lack of other wetland plants such as cotton-grass, cranberry and crowberry.</p>

<p>You can assess if other peatland plants are present by looking at the overall position for the sample point.</p>

<h4>Table 8: record peatland plants</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Peatland plants</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Current public good assessment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Vegetation dominated by heather, bilberry, grass, bracken or moss (not bog moss)</td>
      <td>Biodiversity: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mix of heather, bilberry, grass and mosses, with no clearly dominant vegetation</td>
      <td>Biodiversity: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>An abundance of peatland plants such as cotton-grass, bog moss, cranberry and crowberry</td>
      <td>Biodiversity: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Survey features relevant to non-peat soils</h4>

<p>If you have identified non-peat soils, you can survey the following features.</p>

<h4>Average height of tall or woody vegetation</h4>

<p>On non-peat soils, the presence of taller, woody vegetation contributes to carbon storage on the moorland. Tall, woody vegetation will usually be heather, other dwarf shrubs, gorse, other scrub and scattered trees.</p>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the height of tall or woody vegetation. To do this, it would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You may need to do this in a few places to give you an average across the sample point.</p>

<h4>Table 9: record the average height of tall or woody vegetation</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Average height of tall or woody vegetation</th>
      <th scope="col">Current public good assessment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Bare ground or vegetation mostly below 10cm</td>
      <td>Carbon capture: opportunity to restore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vegetation mostly below 30cm</td>
      <td>Carbon capture: opportunity to enhance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vegetation mostly over 30cm</td>
      <td>Carbon capture: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Average height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation</h4>

<p>On non-peat soils, the presence of tall or deep-rooted vegetation slows the flow of water over the ground. Tall or deep-rooted vegetation will usually include tall and tussocky grasses and bracken, as well as dwarf shrubs such as heather. It may also include scrub and scattered trees.</p>

<p>For tall or deep-rooted vegetation, you can measure the average height of live plants.</p>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You may need to do this in a few places to give you an average across the sample point.</p>

<h4>Table 10: record the height of tall or deep-rooted vegetation</h4>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vegetation mostly over 25cm</td>
      <td>Water storage and flow: already providing, maintain</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Structure of grassy and non-grassy vegetation</h4>

<p>On non-peat soils, the structure of either grassy or non-grassy vegetation can affect how the moorland provides habitat for different species.</p>

<p>Depending on to the vegetation at your sample point, you can assess either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grassy vegetation, where there is over 75% grass or herb cover</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>non-grassy vegetation, where there is over 25% cover of dwarf shrubs, and it does not fit the description of grassy vegetation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can use a thin rod or cane to assess the height of grassy or non-grassy vegetation. It would be helpful to mark it with 5cm, 10cm, 25cm, 30cm and 40cm from its base.</p>

<p>You may need to do this in a few places to give you an average across the sample point</p>

<span class="number">19.7 </span>Step 3: How to assess the public goods provided by your moorland</h3>

<p>You can use the information from step 2 to assess the overall provision of each relevant public good across your moorland.</p>

<p>For each public good across your moorland, you can add up the total number of sample points that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are already providing the public good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>could be enhanced to better provide the public good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>could be restored to provide the public good</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Table 12 gives an example of how this may be done.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.8 </span>Step 4: Identify potential opportunities to maintain or enhance the public goods your moorland provides</h3>

<p>You can use your survey results to help you identify what potential opportunities there are to maintain or change current management practices to keep providing or enhance provision of public goods.</p>

<p>Tables 13, 14 and 15 suggest potential opportunities for all soil types, peat soils and non-peat soils.</p>

<p>The introductory level of the moorland standard does not require you undertake such actions. At this stage you are just considering what management practices could be done in the future.</p>

<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review</h2>
<p>The annual health and welfare review is part of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (<abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr>) offer in 2022.</p>

<p>We will start testing the first annual health and welfare reviews in summer 2022, and we’ll steadily increase these by invitation over the summer before opening to eligible keepers in autumn 2022.</p>

<p>Later this year, we will publish more information on GOV.UK about when applications will open and how to apply. This funding will be available for three years, after which we will review the situation.</p>

<p>Livestock keepers can get funding for a vet or vet-led team of your choice to visit your farm and carry out an annual review of your eligible livestock.  </p>

<p>The review sits alongside the environmental land management standards. You do not need to have an <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> standards agreement to be eligible to apply for the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review. </p>

<p>This review is designed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce endemic diseases such as bovine viral disease (<abbr title="bovine viral disease">BVD</abbr>) in cattle, porcine reproductive and respiratory disease (<abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr>) in pigs and resistance to parasite treatments in sheep</li>
  <li>improve the welfare of your animals</li>
  <li>increase productivity</li>
  <li>ensure your use of veterinary medicines and vaccines is appropriate</li>
  <li>be primarily for the farmer, and not used for inspections or compliance</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your eligibility to apply for this funding</h4>

<p>To be eligible to apply for funding under the <abbr title="Sustainable Farming Incentive">SFI</abbr> annual health and welfare review, your business, the Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>) that’s applying, must be eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>). This means the <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr> must have at least 5 <abbr title="hectares">ha</abbr> of <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligible land and 5 or more <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> entitlements on 16 May 2022.</p>

<p>The review will be made available to those not currently eligible for <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> as soon as possible, so a wider range of livestock keepers can apply for this funding.</p>

<p>If you meet this <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> eligibility requirement, you can apply for the annual health and welfare review if you’re a livestock keeper with more than any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 cattle</li>
  <li>20 sheep</li>
  <li>50 pigs</li>
</ul>

<p>These livestock must be registered in England.</p>

<p>If you have more than one species of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, and the number of livestock in each species exceeds the minimum threshold, you can have one review annually for each species.</p>

<p>If the livestock are kept at different geographical locations, you may be eligible for more than one annual review. More information about how this will work will be published on GOV.UK before applications open.</p>

<h4>How much funding you can apply for</h4>

<p>There is a payment for each species. It is not a payment for each animal.</p>

<p>This payment will help you cover the costs for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vet</li>
  <li>testing for endemic diseases and conditions</li>
  <li>your time</li>
</ul>

<p>The payment for each species is different. This is because the required testing for some species may take longer to do, and some results cost more to analyse.</p>

<p>You’ll be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£684 for a pig review</li>
  <li>£436 for a sheep review</li>
  <li>£522 for a beef cattle review</li>
  <li>£372 for a dairy cattle review</li>
</ul>

<h4>What the review will include</h4>

<p>The review will require:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 to 3 hours of a vet and farmer’s time, looking at health and welfare in a way that meets the farmer’s and vet’s priorities for the farm</li>
  <li>a written report prepared by the vet with agreed recommendations and actions to improve the livestock’s health and welfare</li>
  <li>testing to industry standards for a priority endemic disease or condition, depending on species including <abbr title="bovine viral disease">BVD</abbr> in cattle, <abbr title="porcine reproductive and respiratory disease">PRRS</abbr> in pigs or to find out how effective the anthelmintic being used is in sheep</li>
  <li>the vet sharing some information relevant to the health and welfare of the farmer’s livestock, including test results, with us</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional areas may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a check of your biosecurity measures and advice on improving them</li>
  <li>recommendations about medicines used on your farm including antibiotics and vaccinations</li>
  <li>advice on grants and sources of funding available</li>
</ul>

<h4>How the review will be completed by the vet</h4>

<p>It is expected that each review will take between 2 to 3 hours of your, and the vet’s, time. This does not include the time taken to carry out the required testing for endemic diseases and conditions.</p>

<p>As part of the review, the vet will discuss with you your test results, and recommend actions you can take to improve health and welfare based on testing and their time on the farm.</p>

<h4>What happens after the review</h4>

<p>Once the vet has completed the review, they will provide you with a report that includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the agreed priority recommendations and actions for you to improve the health and welfare of your livestock</li>
  <li>advice about how you can monitor your livestock in future to identify how things are changing throughout the year</li>
  <li>advice about how you can record data as part of the review</li>
  <li>information about where you can find further support</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will not be shared with us or used for any regulatory or site visit purposes.</p>

<p>The vet, or one of their team, will record some information about the review, including test results online. This information will be anonymised and stored securely. It will give us a better understanding of the health and welfare of the national herds and flock. It will not be used for site visits or other compliance checks.</p>

<p>We will publish more information on GOV.UK later this year about when applications will open and how to apply.</p>
