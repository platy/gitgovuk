<p>Joint Statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereinafter referred to as the “United Kingdom”) and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter referred to as “Slovenia”).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Slovenia and the United Kingdom. We celebrate this moment by deepening our relations. As enduring partners that share European history, liberal, democratic values and mutual interests, we commit to working together to promote these values globally. We resolve to develop our excellent relations, friendship and co-operation on foreign and security policy, climate change, economic issues and on science, technology, education and culture, across government, business and civil society.</p>

<p>2.	With this Joint Statement, we look forward to an even closer partnership underpinned by the UK-Slovenia Bilateral Strategy. The strategy will guide and enhance our bilateral and international co-operation and reaffirm our commitment to Euro-Atlantic security.</p>

<p>3.	As a Member State of the European Union, Slovenia supports further co- operation between the EU and the UK.</p>

<h2>Foreign policy and security co-operation</h2>

<p>4.	The UK and Slovenia will develop a shared approach to foreign and security policy, as part of a global network of liberty. Our approach will be based on deeper economic, technology, security and development ties, including in areas such as cyber, strategic communication and climate change.</p>

<p>5.	We will deepen our bilateral defence co-operation and, as committed NATO allies, we will cooperate closely in multilateral organisations in pursuit of our common interests and our commitment to uphold the rules-based international order.</p>

<p>6.	We will work together to promote stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans, ensuring the peace, freedom and democracy that was hard won is maintained. We will further support reform efforts in the region to reach tangible progress on the rule of law, democratic and socio-economic reforms and to take the region forward on its Euro-Atlantic path.</p>

<p>7.	We will explore opportunities to strengthen bilateral co-operation in law enforcement and criminal justice, complementing ongoing co-operation of the two countries via the UK-EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement. This includes deepening co-operation through existing mechanisms, such as INTERPOL, and exploring ways to enhance law enforcement and data sharing. We will work together to tackle Serious Organised Crime, sharing our expertise and analysis.</p>

<p>8.	We will strengthen police co-operation to tackle the drivers and enablers of organised immigration crime by breaking the business model of gangs and organised crime groups.</p>

<h2>Economic co-operation</h2>

<p>9.	We are committed to strengthening economic co-operation between the United Kingdom and Slovenia, working even more closely to further bilateral trade and investment. We will facilitate business opportunities and joint partnerships, promoting the green transition and phase out of coal both domestically and internationally.</p>

<p>10.	We will identify and deliver opportunities for economic co-operation in defence and security to help enhance regional security, tackle existing and new threats, and to bolster and preserve freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>11.	We will build stronger links between our business communities and work together to forge partnerships using our respective strengths in the fields of research and innovation, technology, digitalisation and renewable energy. We will create an environment that promotes digital trade, mutual investment and closer links between start-up companies and entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>12.	We are committed to promoting more tourism through information exchanges especially around business-to-business tourism events.</p>

<h2>Science, education and culture</h2>

<p>13.	We will encourage and build on existing institutional co-operation in the areas of science, technology, education, and culture.</p>

<p>14.	We will share best practice and strengthen links between our Higher Education Institutions and encourage closer institutional co-operation between research, science and innovation communities. We will build on the excellent collaboration between academic partnerships and support educational exchanges to encourage the flow of talent and ideas.</p>

<p>15.	We are committed to further strengthening people-to-people links and to support the rights of United Kingdom and Slovene nationals protected under the Withdrawal Agreement, working with our respective diaspora.</p>

<p>16.	We will work together to promote cultural exchanges including closer co- operation through cultural and sporting ties.</p>

<p>17.	We will work together to strengthen parliamentary links building on the work of the Parliamentary Friendship Group with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the All Party Parliamentary Group.</p>

<h2>Governance</h2>

<p>18.	The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom and the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Slovenia will have responsibility for this Joint Statement. We will hold dialogues twice each year to evaluate progress. Dialogues will be held at senior government official level.</p>

<p>Signed in London, on 23 February 2022 in the English and Slovenian languages, both texts being equally valid.</p>

<p>For the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain</p>

<p>For the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and Northern Ireland</p>
