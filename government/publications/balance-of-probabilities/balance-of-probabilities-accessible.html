<h2>How to make decisions using a balance of probabilities</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff what we mean by making decisions using a balance of probabilities and when we will consider making these decisions.</p>

<p>Some customers may not be able to provide the standard documents we need to deal with their application. Examiners will ask the customer for other evidence. They may also refer the application to Quality and Examination Support team (QuESt) so they can decide using a balance of probabilities, in line with the supporting documents not available guidance.</p>

<p>When making a decision, using a balance of probabilities, QuESt, will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a customer’s <a class="govuk-link" href="#Balance_of_probability">supporting documents (including, if the customer has provided all mandatory documents or other evidence</a>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>what information they can <a class="govuk-link" href="#Balance_of_probability_1">confirm from other sources</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Balance_of_probability_2">other things that may help with their decision making</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>other documents, where the customer does not have alternative evidence, for example Philippines cenomar or South African vault birth certificate</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide if they are more satisfied than not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>that a customer is who they claim to be, and the person named (or described) in the documents</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>that the claimed events more than likely happened</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>with the customer’s identity and nationality</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will not issue a passport, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we are not satisfied with the customer’s nationality or identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are other reasons not to issue the customer a passport (for example, safeguarding, vulnerability, entitlement or fraud concerns)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>When we will consider a balance of probabilities decision</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office examiners, when we will consider making a balance of probabilities decision.</p>

<p>We will consider making a decision using a balance of probabilities, if the customer cannot send the standard documents we need because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are unavailable (for example, the customer cannot provide them, or they are in a country in crisis)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they do not exist (for example, if a birth was not registered)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we need to confirm them but cannot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they do not satisfactorily confirm the customer’s nationality or identity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer cannot send the documents we need, examiners must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>refer the application to Quality Examination Support team (QuESt)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask them to make a decision using a balance of probabilities (in line with supporting documents not available guidance)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Balance of probability: checking the customer’s evidence</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office Quality and Examination Support team how to check a customer’s documents when using a balance of probabilities.</p>

<p>You, the Quality Examination Support team (QuESt) examiner, must check the customer’s documents and evidence. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask customers to provide original documents from the issuing authority and check the documents link the customer (or intended passport holder) to the event</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider what other evidence you can ask a customer for, to confirm the event took place (if they cannot send us original documents)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask the customer for more evidence to confirm their nationality, identity and entitlement (if you need to)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check the documents, evidence and information the customer sends us to make sure they are valid, genuine and you have no fraud concerns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must be aware, that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contemporaneous documents (information from official sources and original documents issued close to the time of the event) are usually reliable evidence that the event took place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some documents are usually more reliable as evidence than others, for example, those with more security features, such as watermarks, which are more difficult to forge or counterfeit</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Checking other evidence</h3>

<p>When you need to decide using a balance of probabilities, there is less of a risk, if all the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customer provides other evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the evidence is reliable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have no fraud concerns with the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer cannot provide other evidence or provides evidence that is less reliable, you must consider what other evidence you can ask for.</p>

<h3>Checking the customer’s nationality</h3>

<p>When checking a customer’s nationality claim, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>decide if they have a claim to British nationality, using HM Passport Office and Home Office nationality guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the identity of the person the claim is through and the link between them and the customer (if it is an automatic claim by descent)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check you have enough evidence to confirm an event took place (for example, a marriage or settlement)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a customer does not have a claim to British nationality, you must consider the impact on them (for example, if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a claim to another nationality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>will be stateless</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>need to register or naturalise for British citizenship with UK Visas and Immigration (see: Withdrawing passports and passport facilities guidance)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Official copies of documents</h3>

<p>If a customer cannot provide us with original documents, you must ask for official copies (for example, a replacement copy of a birth certificate from the original issuing authority).</p>

<p>Official copies are the more reliable forms of evidence.</p>

<h4>Certified copies of original documents</h4>

<p>Certified copies can be a reliable source of evidence, if the customer has a reasonable explanation for why they could not give us the original document. You can consider certified copies of original documents, if they’ve recently been certified by, a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>qualified solicitor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>commissioner for oaths</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>government official from the issuing country</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to contact the certifier to confirm they have certified the customer’s documents.</p>

<h4>Scans and photocopies of documents</h4>

<p>You can also consider scans and photocopies of documents. However, as they are less reliable for use as supporting evidence, you must not accept or consider them on their own. Instead, you must use them together with other evidence a customer gives you such as other official documents.</p>

<h3>Checking evidence with an issuing authority</h3>

<p>As original documents may not always be genuine and genuine documents may not always be reliable, you must check they came from a reliable source.</p>

<p>To help you decide if a document is genuine, you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Knowledge Base (which has examples of documents that may not be reliable for use as evidence)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>counter fraud guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>counter fraud bulletins</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Documents from foreign embassies</h4>

<p>When checking if documents are authentic, you must be aware that the following may issue documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>issuing authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>official bodies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>unofficial sources</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When accepting documents from foreign embassies, you must be aware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we do not consider a foreign embassy an issuing authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some foreign embassies confirm documents when an issuing authority has not been able to - we may not always accept this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a foreign embassy may be able to confirm if a document is genuine, but they cannot confirm an event took place</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, you must not accept a document amended by a foreign embassy or authority to support a change (or confirm an event took place) on its own. You must ask the customer for more evidence.</p>

<h4>Checking other evidence: date of issue</h4>

<p>You must check the date of issue on a customer’s documents, as it may indicate how reliable they are.</p>

<p>Genuine documents issued at the time of an event (or as close to it as possible) are known as contemporaneous documents. They are more reliable as evidence than a document issued much later. For example, a certificate showing a birth was registered several years after it took place is less reliable than a birth certificate issued at the time of the birth</p>

<h2>Balance of probability: information from other sources</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office Quality and Examination Support team what other sources they can use to confirm information when making a decision using a balance of probability.</p>

<p>As well as using the documents and evidence the customer (or third party) sends, you, the Quality Examination Support team (QuESt) must consider if you can confirm information using the systems available to you.</p>

<p>However, you must not search for information to create links to the customer that are not directly supported by their evidence, for example if the customer tells you they have changed their name but there is no document to support this, you must not search for records in that name.</p>

<h3>Confirming information: using our own records</h3>

<p>You may be able to confirm a customer’s information, dates and personal details, using our own passport records (for example, Main Index). See: Searches guidance for how to do this.</p>

<h3>Confirming information: Home Office records</h3>

<p>Our colleagues in the Home Office share data through their computer systems. You may be able to use them to check information (for example, registration or naturalisation dates).</p>

<h3>Confirming information: other government departments</h3>

<p>Other government departments (for example, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office) may be able to provide information to support an application.</p>

<p>The National Archives has information, especially relating to nationality and registration certificates. You must ask Guidance &amp; Quality, Operating Standards to check the National Archives.</p>

<p>You can ask the customer to complete a Subject Access Request (SAR) to get information that another government department holds about them.</p>

<p>If the customer sends in information which they have from a SAR, you must check the information with the other government department which provided it.</p>

<h3>Confirming information: using the application or interviews</h3>

<p>If you have concerns about a customer’s identity, you must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>asking for a countersignatory (or digital referee)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sending a text 200 to a countersignatory (or digital referee)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arranging a standard identity interview</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must also consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interviews under caution, for example, when the customer appears to be who they claim to be, but their documents may not be genuine (only the Counter Fraud team carry out interviews under caution)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Balance of probability decision: other things to consider</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office Quality and Examination Support team what other things to consider when making decision using a balance of probabilities.</p>

<p>Before you, the Quality and Examination Support team member, make a decision using a balance of probabilities, there are a number of other things to consider.</p>

<h3>When there is no birth certificate</h3>

<p>Some countries have different timeframes when registering a birth.</p>

<p>If a customer has lost their original birth certificate, they may not always be able to get a replacement. However, they may be able to provide a copy of the hospital birth record or an extract from the authority registration record to support their application.</p>

<p>You, the Quality Examination Support team (QuESt) must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if a customer can give us other official documents (or records) close to the time of birth (for example, passports, medical records or travel documents)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how reliable the other evidence is to prove the birth happened at the time a customer claims it happened</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what other facts you need to confirm other than that the event took place, for example birth certificates can show legal parentage, the name of the child and the claim to nationality etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>If you need to check the validity of a marriage</h3>

<p>If you need to check the validity of a marriage but a customer cannot provide their marriage certificate, you must consider, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are other official records or documents that show a link to the marriage (for example, a change of name deed or a divorce document)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the marriage is valid in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are documents to show the mother was married to someone else at the time of birth</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>If there is no naturalisation or registration certificate</h3>

<p>If a customer cannot provide their registration (or naturalisation) certificate, you must consider, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you can confirm their citizenship by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>checking UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) or National Archives information</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Case Information Database (CID) or Person Centric View (PCV)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>requesting a Home Office file</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there’s official passport or Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) records that can confirm the customer’s citizenship</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>If you have concerns about a customer’s identity</h3>

<p>If you have concerns about a customer’s identity, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask for more identity documents (for example, passports or travel documents)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>refer the case to Enhanced Application Checking (EAC), if you cannot confirm the customer’s identity from the extra documents they sent</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>If a customer’s name is different on their documents</h3>

<p>If a customer’s documents show a different name, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm how they changed their name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to link all the names they’ve used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the documents show a clear link between the names they claim to have used</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>If the parent’s surname is different to their child’s name</h3>

<p>You must check if you can link a parent to their child if the documents show differences in their surname (family) names.</p>

<p>You may have to ask the customer to send extra evidence (for example, change of name deed, marriage certificates or divorce documents) to show the link between the names they used.</p>

<h3>Checking a customer’s entitlement to a passport</h3>

<p>Even if you confirm the customer’s nationality and identity, you must decide if there is anything else that may stop you from issuing them a passport.</p>

<h2>Check an application using a balance of probabilities</h2>

<p>This section tells the HM Passport Office Quality and Examination Support team how to check a passport application using a balance of probabilities.</p>

<p>When you check an application using balance of probability, you, the Quality Examination Support team (QuESt) examiner, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the customer’s supporting documents and other evidence, including reasons why they could not provide them</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the outcome of other searches and checks you carried out (in line with this guidance)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if there are other documents or evidence the customer can provide</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if there are other searches or checks you can carry out</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide if you are more satisfied than not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>if the person is who they claim to be, and they are the ones named (or described) in the documents</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>if the claimed events are more than likely to have happened</p>
