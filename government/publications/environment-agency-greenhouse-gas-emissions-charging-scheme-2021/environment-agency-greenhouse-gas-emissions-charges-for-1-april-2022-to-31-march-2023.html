<p>Charges under this scheme increase annually on 1 April in line with any increase in the Consumer Prices Index published by the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>).</p>

<p>We take a measure of inflation as at 30 September in the immediately preceding year. All charges will increase by 3.1% from 1 April 2022, in line with the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> measure of inflation published in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/september2021" rel="external">October report</a>.</p>

<p>With the exception of aviation subsistence charges, all customers invoiced from 1 April 2022 must pay the 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 charges. Aviation subsistence is paid in arrears, so invoices from 1 April 2022 will be based on the 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 charges.</p>

<p>The revised charges are set out as follows:</p>
