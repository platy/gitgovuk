<span class="number">5. </span>Information: Get help buying for schools</h2>

<p>The DfE’s new Get help buying for schools service now enables all state funded schools and trusts to access free advice and guidance on buying goods and services through the DfE’s 52 approved frameworks.

<p>From the summer, schools will also be able to get further advice about buying, ongoing support to help run a procurement process themselves, or if a school or trust needs extra support, the service can undertake the buying process on their behalf. The service aims to help schools get best value for their non staff spend.</p>
