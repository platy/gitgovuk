<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: new guidance on record keeping for academies and trusts</h2>

<p>We have published new guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/record-keeping-and-retention-information-for-academies">record keeping for academies and trusts</a>. Drafted in collaboration with the Local Government Association and The National Archives, the guidance aims to assist academies and trust with their record-keeping responsibilities.</p>

<p>Academies and academy trusts should recognise the importance of storing the right records for the right length of time. This includes transferring records to schools or academies when a pupil is transferring between educational settings, as well as storing records after an academy or a trust closes.</p>

<p>This guidance complements the existing guidance in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook/part-2-main-financial-requirements#nbsp-nbsp-being-transparent-about-your-governance">the Academy Trust Handbook</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>It covers pupil (including safeguarding records), staff, building, finance and governance records. It also includes records about the history of the school/academy and, if applicable, the ‘school history’ prior to converting to an academy.</p>

<p>It also provides specific guidance for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>academy only closures</li>
  <li>trust closures/transfers within one local authority</li>
  <li>trust closures/transfers with academies in more than one local authority</li>
</ul>

<p>If a trust or academy has any queries about the most suitable archive for its records, they can consult <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:asd@nationalarchives.gov.uk">The National Archives</a> or use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: funding allocation statements for 2022 to 2023</h2>
