<p>This sets out changes we have made to reflect our inspection practice. It does not include corrections or changes made to improve clarity.</p>

<h2>July 2022 (for September 2022 version)</h2>

<p>Paragraphs 6 to 10: renamed the ‘Privacy notice’ heading as ‘Gathering personal information on inspection’ and updated this section to focus on inspectors’ powers to gather, use and store evidence.</p>

<p>Paragraph 24: clarifies that the fee for a pre-registration inspection may still be payable if a school withdraws its application at or after notification, and the lead inspector has already started off-site inspection activity.</p>

<p>Paragraph 25: clarifies that the fee for a pre-registration inspection may still be payable if inspectors are unable to access the site due to incomplete building works and the school has not requested a deferral or cancellation.</p>

<p>Paragraph 26: clarifies that Ofsted may use the evidence that inspectors gather during additional inspections to inform other work, such as national reporting.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 27 to 29: a new section sets out Ofsted’s overall approach to considering complaints during inspections at the direction of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 44 to 46: a new section sets out the arrangements for proposed or existing alternative provision applying to register as an independent school.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 62 to 71: clarifies Ofsted’s position on the deferral of pre-registration inspections.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 268 to 270: clarifies how Ofsted considers complaints as part of emergency inspections when directed to by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 308 to 315: a new section sets out Ofsted’s approach to emergency inspections of schools that appear to have closed, including arrangements for publishing the report.</p>

<h2>June 2021 (for September 2021 version)</h2>

<p>Paragraphs 22 and 23: updated to clarify that inspection fees will be charged unless a deferral is granted in line with our deferral policy prior to the start of on-site inspection activity, or – in the case of pre-registration inspections – unless the school withdraws their application prior to being notified that an inspection will take place.</p>

<p>Paragraph 213: clarified circumstances in which the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) may commission Ofsted to carry out an emergency inspection.</p>

<h2>April 2021</h2>

<p>Clarified that the handbook applies in the event the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> commissions us to inspect an association school that is normally inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (<abbr title="Independent Schools Inspectorate">ISI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Clarified legal basis for inspectors’ powers of entry.</p>

<p>Clarified that notification calls for pre-registration and material change inspections are made 2 calendar days before inspection (not working days).</p>

<p>Clarified that ‘Form A’ should only be used if there are concerns about safeguarding or serious weaknesses.</p>

<p>Clarified the impact on judgements if inspectors are prevented from talking to pupils on inspection.</p>

<p>Updates to the material change, emergency and progress monitoring chapters to include scenarios in which the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may decide to bring forward a school’s next standard inspection, following an additional inspection, to update the school’s graded judgements.</p>
