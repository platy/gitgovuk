<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>In February 2021, the Prime Minister asked the Secretary of State for Transport to develop a framework for a safe and sustainable return to non-essential international travel when the time is right.</p>

<p>The second <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-travel-taskforce-safe-return-of-international-travel" class="govuk-link">Global Travel Taskforce (<abbr title="Global Travel Taskforce">GTT</abbr>) report</a> was published on 9 April, setting out measures that will balance our priority of ensuring people’s safety, with the desire shared by many of us to once again embark on international travel, be it for business, holidays or reunions with those we love.</p>

<p>A key recommendation of the report was to improve clarity for both consumers and industry by introducing a passenger <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> charter by 17 May setting out consumer rights and responsibilities whilst measures remain. Later this year consult on additional, flexible and modern tools to enforce consumer rights.</p>

<p>This charter aims to provide clear information and guidance on your rights, responsibilities and reasonable expectations regarding international travel whilst <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> measures remain in place. It provides links to other sources of information that will provide further help and guidance, that you may find helpful. This document may be updated in light of further guidance on international travel during the pandemic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Key points</h2>

<p>Travelling during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic will be different, and everyone should be prepared to be as flexible as possible.</p>

<p>When making a booking check the terms and conditions to understand the impact if your plans change, such as in response to changes in restrictions or travel guidance.</p>

<p>You should make sure you have travel insurance at the time of booking, that is suitable for your needs and travel plans, for both international and domestic travel. Please make sure you read and understand the terms and conditions of any travel insurance and check with the provider if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>If your plans or circumstances change, in the first instance you should discuss any concerns with your travel provider (the organisation you booked with, for example if you booked a package holiday, you should speak to the company you booked it through) as soon as possible, to consider available options.</p>

<p>Additional checks are to be expected when travelling and you should allow for extra time during your journey for these.</p>

<p>You are responsible for making sure you have all the correct documentation ready for your journey. Guidance, advice and information about travelling, including entry requirements for the country you are travelling to, may be updated ahead of your travel dates.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make sure you are regularly checking relevant information ahead of your trip. Rules and restrictions may be different in different parts of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) and so you should check the relevant guidance for the country you are in.</p>

<p>You may not be entitled to a refund, but you should speak to your travel provider to discuss options for amending your travel dates or destination, as soon as possible, in the event that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the restrictions in the countries you are travelling to change</li>
  <li>the rating under the government’s traffic light category changes for the country you are travelling to</li>
  <li>any other <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions changes affect your travel plans</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Your plans</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Your rights</h3>

<p>If your flight, ferry, cruise, Eurostar or package holiday to a destination has been cancelled, you have the legal right to a full refund within a reasonable timescale.</p>

<p>You may be offered a voucher or a free change to your booking, but this will not affect your right to insist on a refund instead.</p>

<p>If your ferry departure is delayed by over 90 minutes, you should be offered the choice of either re-routing to your destination or a full refund.</p>

<p>In the event of a significant delay to your flight, ferry, cruise or Eurostar trip your carrier should provide food and refreshments, and if appropriate, accommodation.</p>

<p>The terms and conditions of your booking should be accessible, clear and easy to understand to avoid any confusion.</p>

<p>Government guidance for your destination will provide updates on changes in local <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> rules, requirements or advice during your journey. You can sign up for email alerts for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice for specific destinations</a>.</p>

<p>When you book a package holiday that includes flights, your provider will send you an <abbr title="Air Travel Organiser's Licensing">ATOL</abbr> certificate which explains how your money is protected if the travel agent fails.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Reasonable expectations</h3>

<p>Your travel provider will usually offer additional flexibility where possible, if you are not entitled to a refund. That may mean changing destination, or dates of travel, if the provider is given sufficient notice of the changes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>Always check your terms and conditions at the time of your booking to understand the impact if your plans change and speak to your travel provider if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Make sure you have adequate travel insurance that is suitable for your plans and your needs, from the time of booking for both international and domestic travel plans. Consider including cover for cancellations. You should check the terms and conditions of your insurance, and understand what is excluded from cover.</p>

<p>You should be prepared to be as flexible as possible. Try to choose flexible bookings and ensure the destination and dates can be changed.</p>

<p>You should advise your travel provider of any changes as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you trip is <abbr title="Air Travel Organiser's Licensing">ATOL</abbr> protected, keep a record of your <abbr title="Air Travel Organiser's Licensing">ATOL</abbr> certificate and take it with you on your trip. It is proof your holiday or flight is protected and explains what protections you have and what to do if you need to make a claim.</p>

<p>Keep a record of any payment made in case you need to claim a refund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>What to do if things go wrong</h3>

<p>You should try to resolve any issues with your travel provider in the first instance.</p>

<p>If you have paid for your booking and believe you are entitled to a refund, but the provider will not refund you, you can escalate your claim to an alternative dispute resolution body.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Financial Conduct Authority has produced <a rel="external" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/finalised-guidance/cancellations-refunds-helping-consumers-rights-and-routes-refunds" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to get a refund</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Your <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> safety</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Your rights</h3>

<p>You have the right to be safe while travelling on <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> carriers and while experiencing <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> regulated travel businesses.</p>

<p>Your <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> travel provider should follow all appropriate <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> safety and hygiene measures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>You must follow all appropriate <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> safety rules and restrictions. You should regularly check these requirements ahead of your trip to keep yourself and others safe in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the countries you are travelling to.</p>

<p>You must be aware of and be prepared to provide the right certification for required tests, vaccines or exemptions. This may be different in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the countries that you are travelling to.</p>

<p>You must understand how restrictions in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and in the countries you are travelling to, could impact your return travel arrangements.</p>

<p>You must allow additional time in your travel plans to carry out the testing requirements - both in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and the countries you are travelling to. You should do appropriate research and read the terms of service when choosing a testing provider, and consider the different types of testing required at each stage of your journey.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>What to do if things go wrong</h3>

<p>If you are unsure what the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> safety and hygiene measures are for your travel provider, they should be able to share their standards and any policy they have on keeping consumers safe.</p>

<p>You can raise any concerns about <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> safety measures for specific parts of your journey directly with the relevant provider, particularly if you feel that these do not meet the required standards. You should ask the provider to provide details on their complaint procedure.</p>

<p>You should keep a copy of key information with you - including any certificates, insurance documentation and contact details for your travel provider and the embassy in the countries you are travelling to, in case you require assistance whilst abroad.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Your individual needs</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Your rights</h3>

<p>Assistance should always be available according to your needs, where appropriate, to ensure that travel continues to be inclusive and accessible for all passengers.</p>

<p>Government guidance and travel advice can be obtained in a number of accessible formats.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Reasonable expectations</h3>

<p>Travel during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> restrictions may mean that any assistance services will need additional adjustments.</p>

<p>Your provider should give you information about your journey in a format you can access and understand.</p>

<p>This also includes updates if something changes that affects your trip, for example if new restrictions come into place.</p>

<p>Airports, ports and rail terminals should give clear information about the processes they have in place for passengers who need assistance while travelling.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>You should let your travel provider know about any accessibility or assistance needs as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This should be at least 48 hours before travel so that arrangements can be made for you.</p>

<p>You must ensure you have the correct documentation required for any exemptions from restrictions in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and countries you are travelling to.</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Keeping informed</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Your Rights</h3>

<p>Your provider should inform you, with sufficient notice, where restrictions or other significant changes will affect your booking to help you consider your options.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Reasonable expectations</h3>

<p>Your travel provider should make a reasonable effort to also inform you of where restrictions or changes will affect your plans, to help you to remain safe and well abroad.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Your responsibility</h3>

<p>You should regularly check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">government guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a> relevant to your travel plans when booking and regularly ahead of your trip.</p>

<p>You must not only rely on your travel provider to provide this information, as you are responsible for following the rules.</p>

<p>You should check in advance what will happen if you or a member of your party become ill while abroad. In particular you should understand what medical care your travel insurance covers, what additional restrictions will apply in the destination country, and who may be able to provide information and assistance.</p>
