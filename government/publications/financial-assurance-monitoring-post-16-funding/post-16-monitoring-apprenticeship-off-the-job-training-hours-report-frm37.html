<p>This document provides an overview of the FRM37 monitoring report that we publish monthly in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/account/selector?ReturnUrl=%2Fwelcome" rel="external">post-16 monitoring reports dashboard.</a> It confirms what data we include, how we calculate the thresholds and what you need to do to ensure that you are reporting off-the-job-training (OTJT) hours correctly. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-off-the-job-training">apprenticeships off-the-job-training: policy background and examples</a> for guidance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Contents of the report</h2>

<p>Initially the report contained planned OTJT hours, however, from December 2021, we included both planned and actual OTJT hours in a single combined report to allow users to review the apprentices’ journey in a single space. We reflected this change in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-assurance-monitoring-post-16-funding/financial-assurance-monitoring-post-16-funding-for-2021-to-2022">Financial Assurance: Monitoring post-16 funding for 2021 to 2022.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Why we have this report</h2>

<p>English apprenticeships include OTJT as a statutory requirement to enable apprentices to develop the knowledge, skills and behaviours of the approved apprenticeship referenced in the apprenticeship agreement. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1037429/2122_Provider_Rules__Version_2_To_Publish.pdf" rel="external">apprenticeship funding rules</a> specify that to be eligible for government funding, at least 20% of the apprentice’s normal working hours, over the planned duration of the apprenticeship practical period, must be spent on OTJT.</p>

<p>We want to ensure that apprentices are getting a high-quality experience with a meaningful period of time put aside to enable them to develop knowledge and skills that will benefit their long-term career prospects. If you are not able to identify how the minimum of 20% will be met, you should consider whether this is the appropriate programme for the apprentice to enrol on, or if they should be on a more advanced programme, where a larger amount of learning and skills development is required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How the report works</h2>

<p>This report identifies programmes where either the planned and/or actual OTJT hours reported on the ILR are below the 20% minimum. To do this we review all apprenticeship programme aims where either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>planned OTJT hours are reported, or</li>
  <li>the programme is completed (completion status code 2) and the actual OTJT hours are reported.</li>
</ul>

<p>We compare the OTJT hours against the apprentice’s reported employment intensity (EII), applying the method described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1037429/2122_Provider_Rules__Version_2_To_Publish.pdf" rel="external">apprenticeship funding rules.</a> This includes deducting the apprentice’s statutory leave entitlement (pro rata for apprentices reported as part-time workers). Because employment intensity is currently reported as a banded value, we use the minimum value for each band when calculating total weekly employment hours and statutory leave entitlements. The actual amount of OTJT required for the apprentice may be higher than this.</p>

<p>There is currently a minor known issue affecting this report, details are in the ‘known issues’ tab, on the post-16 monitoring dashboard. The fix for this is due to be deployed for the R06 release in February 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What you need to do</h2>

<p>R05 data is available in the post-16 monitoring dashboard, so it is important to review your data error reports to ensure you make any revisions in your R06 ILR return.</p>

<p>Planned OTJT hours must be calculated using the methodology described in the funding rules and recorded on the commitment statement by all relevant parties at the outset of the apprenticeship programme. When you record the start of the apprenticeship in your ILR submissions, you must also report the number of planned OTJT hours for the whole programme in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/ilr/field/phours" rel="external">planned hours field.</a> This field is mandatory and must accurately reflect the evidence documented on the apprenticeship agreement and commitment statement.</p>

<p>In the report, if we have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a continuing apprentice (completion status code 1 in the ILR), then we have identified recorded OTJT hours below the minimum 20% of the apprentice’s reported working hours. While this figure continues to be reported in your monthly ILR submissions it will appear in the report, even if the apprentice completes their programme</li>
  <li>an apprentice who has completed their learning, then you need to check the data reported in the planned hours field and the value reported in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/ilr/field/otjacthours" rel="external">actual hours for off the job field</a> are accurate and supported by evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to recalculate the amount of planned OTJT hours for the apprentice, you must update the commitment statement and make any necessary amendments to the data reported in the ILR planned hours field in-year and by the close of the next ILR submission. You may also need to review your enrolment processes to ensure that this figure is calculated correctly for future starts. You must then ensure that 20% OTJT hours are delivered to all apprentices before entering the gateway for assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What we will do</h2>

<p>We will review the data in this report regularly as part of our commitment to supporting high quality apprenticeship provision. We will contact providers from R06 if we identify clear patterns of inaccurate data (such as apparently ‘default’ values, or impossibly high amounts of OTJT). We may ask you to provide evidence of how you calculated and delivered the OTJT hours and could require you to take further action in-year to ensure you meet the minimum requirement.</p>
