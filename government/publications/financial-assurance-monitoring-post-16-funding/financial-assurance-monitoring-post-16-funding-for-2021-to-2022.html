<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We monitor the data reported to us as part of our assurance work. We monitor data from the Individualised Learner Record (ILR), School Census (SC), and other sources such as the Earnings Adjustment Statement (EAS) and the Student Loans Company (SLC).</p>

<p>This desktop review of how the funding system and funding rules operates has the following aims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to identify possible errors in the funding claimed for post-16 delivery that require further investigation</li>
  <li>to improve the overall quality of the data reported</li>
  <li>to assure us that the provision we buy meets our published funding rules</li>
  <li>to inform our standard business processes for assurance, audit, end-of-year payment and reconciliation</li>
  <li>to support the development of policy (existing and new policy development)</li>
  <li>to ensure benefits are realised and policy reaches its intended target group</li>
</ul>

<h3>Purpose of this document</h3>

<p>This document lists the areas that we are monitoring during the 2021 to 2022 funding year (1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022) and provides guidance on how to correct data quality or funding errors. There is no set review date for this document, however, we will act on feedback to ensure reports are fit for purpose and consider if any new data or policy priorities should be included.</p>

<p>You must read this document along with any other documents referred to and take the necessary action to ensure data returns and funding claims are correct. Failure to take the necessary action may impact your year-end funding for 2021 to 2022. These documents include:</p>

</ul>

<p>For learners who started before 1 August 2021, please refer to the documents that applied on the learner’s first day in learning.</p>

<h3>Intended audience</h3>

<p>This document is for colleges, training providers and other providers who have a funding agreement with us. Specifically, it is aimed at those staff who submit data to us and those who review data quality. We have included a summary of all the relevant rules and guidance in this document. We have assumed that you are familiar with these documents and the relevant terminology.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The term ‘we’ refers to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA).</li>
  <li>When we refer to ‘you’ or ‘providers’, this includes colleges, higher education institutions, training organisations, local authorities, schools, academies and employers that receive funding from us to deliver education and training.</li>
  <li>When we refer to ‘learners’, this includes students.</li>
  <li>The term ‘post-16 delivery’ includes 16 to 19 study programmes, T Levels, T Level transition programmes, traineeships, apprenticeships, adult education budget, community learning and advanced learner loans. This does not include the European social fund.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How we will use data</h3>

<p>Failure to submit accurate data can have a negative impact on funding claims and achievement rates which could be treated as a serious breach of your funding agreement with us. If we believe you have submitted data in error, or that you have not submitted it in a timely way, we will contact you and either ask you to provide further evidence to support the data or require you to correct it within a specified period.</p>

<p>You must respond within this period, either by correcting data as requested or by providing the required evidence. If you fail to respond appropriately to any request or subsequent request, we may take action according to the terms of your funding agreement with us. For some reports, if you have data errors following the closure of the R14 ILR at the end of the funding year, we may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recover funding where we are confident the claim has been made in error</li>
  <li>offset funding against future delivery</li>
  <li>conduct assurance visits for specific issues before the end-of-year reconciliation statements are issued (this may result in a recovery of funds)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have been subject to repeated action or a funding recovery, this will raise your risk profile with us and increase the likelihood of your organisation’s selection for audit. Various assurance and provider facing teams across the ESFA review the post-16 monitoring report dashboard internally and may use this to inform any regular management conversations with you in addition to using it to inform their future activity.</p>

<h2>Summary of changes</h2>

<p>Changes to this guidance can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>revisions – where we revise small amounts of text or paragraphs</li>
  <li>removals – where we remove text or sections</li>
  <li>new items – where we add new sections</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 2 changes</h3>

<p>Type of change: revision</p>

<p>Details of change: FRM37 – Apprenticeship off-the-job training hours below the minimum.</p>

<p>Updated December 2021</p>

<p>Type of change: revision</p>

<p>Following the publication of the improved dashboards slight amendments have been made to the “Filters” and “Viewing and exporting data” sections.</p>

<p>Updated January 2022</p>

<h2>Using the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard</h2>

<p>We will share the data we analyse with you through the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard every month from December (R04), with the latest school census data (S02/S05) being incorporated in the following spring. Our expectation is that you will use the dashboard as part of your routine data quality and submission cycles to proactively address potential errors.</p>

<p>The dashboard contains data which will help you to identify and understand the highlighted issue(s) including details of qualifications previously achieved by the learner, other providers involved in delivery and SLC data from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lpservices.slc.co.uk/" rel="external">Learning Provider Portal.</a> We also include calculated earnings for the delivery so that you are aware of the potential funding impact if you have not corrected errors by year-end.</p>

<p>We will continue to use the same report numbering convention across years for consistency and to avoid confusion. If we remove any reports from the plan, any new ones added will have a new unique number. We will publish screenshots to accompany this guidance prior to the December R04 release.</p>

<h2>Accessing the dashboard</h2>

<p>To access the post-16 monitoring dashboard, you will need to log into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">View your education data.</a> You will need an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account">IDAMS account</a> with the “view your education data – post-16 monitoring” user role and associated with a UKPRN to access the dashboard securely.</p>

<p>Your organisation’s super user will be able to grant you the correct user role. Once successfully logged in, you will have the option to select ‘Data quality and assurance’, following which you should see a link to the ‘post-16 monitoring reports dashboard’ along with any other dashboards you have access to.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>The default setting for the dashboard is to show data for all funding streams we investigate following the most recent data return for the current year. We designed the dashboard with filters to allow access to data for previous years and periods within the same space. You are also able to filter data by a specific funding stream.</p>

<p>Any filters you have applied will be carried over to any other tabs you view within the post-16 monitoring dashboard. You can reset any filters you have applied by clicking the “back arrow”. If you apply any filters before exiting the dashboard, these will reset the next time you log in.</p>

<h2>Viewing and exporting data</h2>

<p>To view aims and learner level data you need to click on the ‘download all data’ button on the landing page. If you hover your mouse over the 3 dots above the table on the right-hand side, you will have the option to export data”. You can then select either “Summarised Data” or “Data with Current Layout” (this is a more pivot table friendly option), to export it into an Excel spreadsheet, where you can filter it and identify specific records within your own system. In most cases, the fields match the fields in the ILR and SC specifications and will show the data you submitted most recently. Where you have not submitted any data in a field, these cells will contain a relevant placeholder value such as “-1” or will appear blank, indicating a NULL value. We assign each row in every report a ’query ID’ to support your analysis and help any discussions you may need to have with us.</p>

<p>You can also view the data behind each of the graphs and charts in the dashboard by right clicking on the visual and selecting ‘show as a table’.</p>

<p>You can export data from any table by hovering your mouse over the table, clicking on the three dots in the top right-hand corner of each box and then selecting ‘export data’. You will be given the option to ‘download summarised data’ and select whether you want to export this as an “.xlsx” or “.csv” file. A text box will appear at the top of the screen indicating that the data is being exported. Once this process is complete you will then be given the option to open or save the exported data. The exported dataset will indicate which filters you applied in a single worksheet with column headers and one row of data for each query identified.</p>

<p>A new “known issues” tab shows any changes or fixes we are applying to the data in the dashboard. This tab gives you information on the issue, how it affects your data, and when we expect to fix the issue by.</p>

<h2>Publication dates</h2>

<p>The landing page of the dashboard indicates when we will refresh the data each month in line with the dates published in column G (page 3) in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-ilr-standard-file-specifications-and-reference-data">ILR freeze schedule 2021 to 2022.</a></p>

<p>Each month, we use the data as follows:</p>

<p>December (ILR R04): initial data release
January (ILR R05)
February (ILR R06): review point, used for contacting providers
March (ILR R07):
April (ILR R08): used for contacting providers
May (ILR R09): used for contacting providers
June (ILR R10): review point, used for contacting providers
July (ILR R11):
August (ILR R12): used for contacting providers
September (ILR R13): used for contacting providers 
November (ILR R14): used for calculating recoveries and reconciliation</p>

<h2>FRM01 - Learners repeating a learning aim they have already achieved</h2>

<h4>Changes from previous funding year</h4>

<p>None</p>

<h4>Funding streams reviewed</h4>

<p>19 to 24 traineeships
Adult education budget (National)
Advanced learner loans
Apprenticeships</p>

<h4>Relevant guidance</h4>

<p>Adult education budget - We will not fund a learner to repeat the same regulated qualification where they have previously achieved it. The exceptions are for any GCSE where the learner has not achieved grade C, or 4, or higher.</p>

<p>Apprenticeships - You must account for prior learning and experience when negotiating a price with the employer. You must reduce the content, duration, and price, where the individual has prior learning necessary to achieve the apprenticeship. Funds must not be used to pay for skills already attained by the apprentice.</p>

<h4>What you need to do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>Correct data, learner is ineligible.</p>

<p>For apprenticeships starting on or after 1 May 2017 (excluding English and maths), the negotiated price must reflect the prior learning identified. You must be able to demonstrate that enough learning is still required to meet the required minimum duration.</p>

<p>For advanced learner loans, you must remove the Advanced Learner Loans Indicator (ADL) from the learning aim record and contact the SLC to cancel the loan if the learner was required to take out a loan in error.</p>

<p>For any other learning aims, you must recode the aims with Funding model code 99, or follow provider support manual guidance on correcting data errors after hard close of the previous year (aims with an incorrect funding model).</p>

<h4>What we will do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>If there are errors outstanding in this report at R14, we will recover any funding overclaim.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For provision funded through a grant, this value will be recorded as an adjustment against your reconciliation statement. Provisional error values will be used for your year-end funding claim to alert you to any potential impact on your final position at R14.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For provision funded through a contract, we will offset this value against future delivery.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Adult education budget - You or your subcontractors must not claim funding for any part of any learner’s learning aim or programme that duplicates provision they have received from any other source.</p>

<p>Apprenticeships - The individual must not be undertaking another apprenticeship or be undertaking training funded through AEB, where that training will replicate vocational and other learning aims covered by the apprenticeship, including English and maths.</p>

<p>16 to 19 - Providers must avoid recording ESFA funding for any part of a student’s study programme that duplicates that received from another source, for example, other ESFA programme funding, Office for Students (OfS).</p>

<h4>What you need to do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>Review evidence, correct as necessary.</p>

<p>You must report withdrawals and transfers in a timely manner with the relevant withdrawal reason and record the date of the last learning activity for which you have evidence.</p>

<p>Where the learners have transferred to you through action by us (for example, termination of previous provider’s funding agreement) there is no action to take.</p>

<p>If a learner in receipt of an advanced learner loan changes provider during the learning aim, they must inform the SLC and reapply to the SLC for a loan to continue their studies at the new provider.</p>

<p>If you cannot evidence that you hold the contract as the lead provider for the delivery of learning you are claiming funding for, you must remove the learning aim record(s) from your ILR. You must not record this on the ILR with a completion status of ‘withdrawn’.</p>

<p>If the learner was still in learning with another provider on the day that they started learning with yourselves, they are ineligible for funding, and you must recode the learning aim record as Funding Model 99. You may need to also remove the advanced learner loans indicator flag from the learning aim record and contact the SLC to cancel the loan if the learner was required to take out a loan in error.</p>

<h4>What we will do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>Request evidence, determine action.</p>

####Relevant guidance</p>

<p>Provider support manual - The data you record on the ILR must accurately reflect the journey for the learner and what has happened. Inaccurate information must never be entered even where it is perceived that this would result in a more equitable claim for funding or accurate record of performance.</p>

<p>Adult education budget - The ILR must accurately reflect the learning and support (where applicable) you have identified, planned, and delivered to eligible individuals. You must not report inaccurate information that would result in an overstatement of the funding claimed.</p>

<p>Apprenticeships - When a change of circumstance results in over-payment of funds from an employer’s apprenticeship account or government-employer co-investment, any over-payment must be repaid by you.</p>

<p>Advanced learner loans - You must accurately complete all ILR fields for loans-funded learners and make ILR returns as required in the ILR specification and the provider support manual. Where your data does not support the funding, you have received from SLC or claimed from the loan’s bursary, we will take action to get this corrected and could recover funds or require you to make repayments to SLC.</p>

<h4>What you need to do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>Review evidence, correct as necessary.</p>

<p>Please note: You cannot change or remove the data in this report if it accurately reflects the evidence you hold. The purpose of the report is to give notice of potential clawback for any overclaim resulting from late reporting of the data.</p>

<h4>What we will do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>If there are errors outstanding in this report at R14, we will recover any funding overclaim.</p>

T levels</p>

<h4>Relevant guidance</h4>

<p>Planned hours must take place in line with the institution’s normal working pattern.</p>

<p>The number of hours a student may study during a week should not be greater than the maximum number of hours a young person can legally work during a week. From this year, the number of hours a student may study should not be greater than 40 hours per week and both the study programme’s planned hours and planned dates will need to reflect this.</p>

<p>If the student is on a study programme that spans more than one funding year, the planned hours recorded in the data return must be set at the start of each funding year to only reflect the planned hours for the funding year.</p>

<h4>What you need to do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>Review evidence, correct as necessary.</p>

<p>You must adjust the planned learning hours to ensure that the learner is not studying more than 40 hours per week.</p>

<h2>FRM37 – Apprenticeship off-the-job training hours below the minimum</h2>

<h4>Changes from previous funding year</h4>

<p>Previously an internal report.</p>

<p>Update December 2021</p>

<p>Revised to include actual off-the-job training hours. From 2021 to 2022, FRM37 reports programmes where either the planned or actual off-the-job training hours are below the 20% minimum.</p>

<h4>Funding streams reviewed</h4>

<p>Apprenticeships from May 2017</p>

<h4>Relevant guidance</h4>

<p>To be eligible for government funding at least 20% of the apprentice’s normal working hours, over the planned duration of the apprenticeship practical period, must be spent on off-the-job training.</p>

<p>If the apprentice works less than 30 hours per week, they are considered to be part-time, and you must extend the duration.</p>

<p>English and maths training, up to and including level 2, does not count towards the minimum 20% off-the-job training requirement; where required this must be delivered in addition to the minimum requirement.</p>

<h2>FRM42 - Work experience over 300 hours not recorded as core aim</h2>

<h4>Changes from previous funding year</h4>

<p>Now includes data submitted through the School Census.</p>

<h4>Funding streams reviewed</h4>

<p>16 to 19 study programmes
16 to 18 traineeships</p>

<h4>Relevant guidance</h4>

<p>The core aim is the most important or central element of the programme, around which the rest of the programme is built. It will usually be the component with the largest amount of timetabled activity associated with it and will usually reflect the primary focus of the programme in line with the student’s intended destination (such as employment or further study) at the end of their programme.</p>

<p>Traineeships must always have work experience as the core aim. Study programmes that are not traineeships may also have work experience as the core aim.</p>

<h4>What you need to do (ILR providers)</h4>

<p>Review evidence, correct as necessary.</p>

<p>If you are not delivering a more substantial qualification as part of the learner’s programme, you must report work experience aims of this size as the core aim.</p>

<p>Traineeships must have work experience recorded as the core aim.</p>

<h2>FRM43 – 16 to 19 study programme learners with no planned learning hours, who are not identified as requiring additional learning support through either an EHC plan or self-identified LLDD and health problems</h2>

<h4>Changes from previous funding year</h4>

<p>Previously an internal report</p>

<h4>Funding streams reviewed</h4>

<p>16 to 19 study programmes</p>

<h4>Relevant guidance</h4>

<p>For 16 to 19 funded learners, the planned learning hours field should be completed with the total planned timetabled hours spent on qualifications. These qualifications must be approved for teaching to 16- to 19-year-olds on the ESFA list of qualifications approved for funding 14 to 19 or any alternative list which may be published by the Department for Education (DfE) in the future. The qualifications must also be listed as valid for 16 to 19 funding in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://findalearningaimbeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">Find a learning aim.</a></p>

<p>Providers must ensure that the planned hours entered on data returns are realistic and deliverable to each individual student and are supported by auditable evidence that the eligible activity offered to learners is timetabled.</p>

<p>Learners who are not studying any regulated qualifications should not have planned learning hours recorded.</p>

<h2>FRM69 – Proportion of planned EEP hours is greater than or equal to 50% of total planned hours and learner is not recorded with high needs.</h2>

<h4>Changes from previous funding year</h4>

<p>Previously an internal report</p>

<h4>Funding streams reviewed</h4>

<p>16 to 19 study programmes; 16 to 18 traineeships; T levels</p>

<h4>Relevant guidance</h4>

<p>Non-qualification hours cover employment, enrichment, and pastoral (EEP) activity. These hours must be timetabled, organised and/or supervised by the institution. Institutions must always record work experience that is eligible for funding as employability, enrichment, and pastoral (EEP) hours. Work experience that the institution has planned, organised, and supervised will be recorded as non-qualification activity and should be identified in data returns using the work placement entity.</p>

<h2>Other areas that we are monitoring internally</h2>

<p>We will not publish an external report for these initially. We will monitor internally to support the development of future systems and policy, and to identify specific scenarios which may be covered by an external report in the future. We may contact you to better understand data, and if we identify any behaviour that indicates a potential funding risk.</p>

<h4>16 to 19 study programmes</h4>

<p>Work experience hours, to assure compliance with rules about internal and external work experience hours.<br>
Learners studying at a level below their highest previous attainment, to ensure data accuracy, quality of delivery and eligibility for funding.</p>

<p>Learners not meeting the condition of funding, to ensure data accuracy and quality of delivery.</p>

<h4>Adult education budget</h4>

<p>English and maths entitlement, to ensure learners are not being funded for provision that is not necessary for progressing to level 2 and identify where any learners may already have met their entitlement.</p>

<p>Local flexibility and legal entitlements, to ensure data accuracy and eligibility for local flexibility funding.</p>

<p>Prior attainment and progression relating to the level 3 adult offer, to ensure data accuracy and eligibility for funding.</p>

<h4>Advanced learner loans</h4>

<p>Data quality, to ensure data reported in the ILR and via the SLC is consistent and learners are not over-exposed to debt. This includes monitoring withdrawals and other learner changes that should be reported in a timely manner to the SLC.</p>

<h4>Apprenticeships</h4>

<p>Learners not achieving English and/or maths prior to completing their programme, to ensure data accuracy and quality of delivery.</p>
