<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We monitor the data reported to us as part of our assurance work. We monitor data from the Individualised Learner Record (<abbr title="Individualised Learner Record">ILR</abbr>), School Census (<abbr title="school census">SC</abbr>), and other sources such as the Earnings Adjustment Statement (<abbr title="Earnings Adjustment Statement">EAS</abbr>) and the Student Loans Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>).</p>

<p>This desktop review of how the funding system and funding rules operates has the following aims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to identify possible errors in the funding claimed for post-16 delivery that require further investigation</p>

<p>For learners who started before 1 August 2022, please refer to the documents that applied on the learner’s first day in learning.</p>

<h3>Intended audience</h3>

<p>This document is for colleges, training providers and other providers who have a funding agreement with us. Specifically, it is aimed at those staff who submit data to us and those who review data quality. We have included a summary of all the relevant rules and guidance in this document. We have assumed that you are familiar with these documents and the relevant terminology.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘we’ refers to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) and colleagues in the wider Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we refer to ‘you’ or ‘providers’, this includes colleges, higher education institutions, training organisations, local authorities, schools, academies, and employers that receive funding from us to deliver education and training.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we refer to ‘learners’, this includes students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The term ‘post-16 delivery’ includes 16 to 19 study programmes, T Levels, T Level transition programmes, traineeships, apprenticeships, adult education budget, support funding, community learning, and advanced learner loans. This does not include the European social fund which finishes at the end of 2023.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How we will use data</h3>

<p>Failure to submit accurate data can have a negative impact on funding claims and achievement rates which could be treated as a serious breach of your funding agreement with us. If we believe you have submitted data in error, or that you have not submitted it in a timely way, we will contact you and either ask you to provide further evidence to support the data or require you to correct it within a specified period.</p>

<p>You must respond within this period, either by correcting data as requested or by providing the required evidence. If you fail to respond appropriately to any request or subsequent request, we may act according to the terms of your funding agreement with us. For some reports, if you have data errors following the closure of the R14 <abbr title="Individualised Learner Record">ILR</abbr> at the end of the funding year, we may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>recover funding where we are confident the claim has been made in error</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offset funding against future delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conduct assurance visits for specific issues before the end-of-year reconciliation statements are issued (this may result in a recovery of funds)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have been subject to repeated action or a funding recovery, this will raise your risk profile with us and increase the likelihood of your organisation’s selection for audit.</p>

<p>Various assurance and provider facing teams across the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> review the post-16 monitoring report dashboard internally and may use this to inform any regular management conversations with you, in addition to using it to inform their future activity.</p>

<h2>Summary of changes</h2>

<p>Changes to this guidance can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>revisions – where we revise small amounts of text or paragraphs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>removals – where we remove text or sections</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new items – where we add new sections</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>New and recently added reports</h3>

<h4>Available from R04 2022 to 2023</h4>

<p><strong>FRM38</strong> - Learners undertaking English and/or maths within AEB when they have already achieved their legal entitlement.</p>

<p><strong>FRM49</strong> – T level programmes not recorded against an approved T level funding band.</p>

<p><strong>FRM50</strong> – T level programmes with a planned duration of less than the minimum of 2 years (653 days).</p>

<p><strong>FRM65</strong> – Total work experience hours for the T level industry placement are below the minimum for the specialism.</p>

<h4>Available from R12 2021 to 2022</h4>

<p><strong>FRM43</strong> – 16 to 19 study programme learners with no planned learning hours, who are not identified as requiring additional learning support through either an EHC plan or self-identified <abbr title="learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities">LLDD</abbr> and health problems.</p>

<p><strong>FRM69</strong> – Proportion of planned <abbr title="employment, enrichment, and pastoral activity">EEP</abbr> hours is greater than or equal to 50% of total planned hours and learner is not recorded with high needs.</p>

<h3>Removals</h3>

<p><strong>FRM02</strong> – Duplicate learning aims being delivered at two or more providers.</p>

<p><strong>FRM03</strong> – 16 to 19 funded learners who are also funded elsewhere.</p>

<p>In response to provider feedback and to reflect how we use this data, we will no longer routinely publish FRM02 and FRM03 as external reports. We will continue to review this data internally and will share data with providers on an exceptional basis where we have concerns relating to a higher volume of learners.</p>

<h2>Using the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard</h2>

<p>We will share the data we analyse with you through the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard every month from December (R04), with the latest school census data (S02) being incorporated in the following spring. Our expectation is that you will use the dashboard as part of your routine data quality and submission cycles to proactively address potential errors.</p>

<p>Providers should check data error reports as usual, whilst being aware that amendments made by school census submitters may not appear in the dashboard until after we have processed the data submitted at the next autumn census. Therefore, you will need to pay attention to this between census submissions. There is a new filter allowing data to be viewed from the <abbr title="Individualised Learner Record">ILR</abbr> only, <abbr title="school census">SC</abbr> only or both which may help filtering these out between census submissions.</p>

<p>The dashboard contains data which will help you to identify and understand the highlighted issue(s) including details of qualifications previously achieved by the learner, other providers involved in delivery and <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> data from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lpservices.slc.co.uk/" rel="external">Learning Provider Portal.</a> We also include calculated earnings for the delivery so that you are aware of the potential funding impact if you have not corrected errors by year-end.</p>

<p>We will continue to use the same report numbering convention across years for consistency and to avoid confusion. If we remove any reports from the plan, any new ones added will have a new unique number.</p>

<h2>Accessing the dashboard</h2>

<p>To access the post-16 monitoring dashboard, you will need to log into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">View your education data.</a> You will need an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account">IDAMS account</a> with the ‘<strong>view your education data – post-16 monitoring’</strong> user role and associated with a UKPRN to access the dashboard securely.</p>

<p>Your organisation’s super user will be able to grant you the correct user role. Once successfully logged in, you will have the option to select <strong>‘Data quality and assurance’</strong>, following which you should see a link to the <strong>‘post-16 monitoring reports dashboard’</strong> (along with any other dashboards you have access to) and you click on <strong>‘Dashboard’.</strong></p>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>The default setting for the dashboard is to show data for all funding streams we investigate following the most recent data return for the current year. We designed the dashboard with filters to allow access to data for previous years and periods within the same space. You are also able to filter data by a specific funding stream.</p>

<p>Any filters you have applied will be carried over to any other tabs you view within the post-16 monitoring dashboard. You can reset any filters you have applied by clicking the ‘back arrow’. If you apply any filters before exiting the dashboard, these will reset the next time you log in.</p>

<h2>Viewing and exporting data</h2>

<p>To view aims and learner level data you need to click on the ‘download all data’ button on the landing page. If you hover your mouse over the three dots immediately above the table on the right-hand side, you will have the option to export data. You can then select either <strong>‘Summarised data’</strong> or <strong>‘Data with current layout’</strong> (this is a more pivot table friendly option), to export it into an Excel spreadsheet, where you can apply filters and identify specific records within your own system. In most cases, the fields match the fields in the <abbr title="Individualised Learner Record">ILR</abbr> and <abbr title="school census">SC</abbr> specifications and will show the data you submitted most recently. Where you have not submitted any data in a field, these cells will contain a relevant placeholder value such as ‘-1’ or will appear blank, indicating a NULL value. We assign each row in every report a  <strong>’query ID’</strong> to support your analysis and help any discussions you may need to have with us.</p>

<p>You can also view the data behind each of the graphs and charts in the dashboard by right clicking on the visual and selecting <strong>‘show as a table’.</strong></p>

<p>You can export data from any table by hovering your mouse over the table, clicking on the three dots in the top right-hand corner and then selecting <strong>‘export data.’’</strong> You will be given the option to export <strong>‘Summarised data’</strong> and a text box will appear at the top of the screen indicating that the data has been exported. You will then be given the option to open the exported data and you can then save it. The exported dataset will indicate which filters you applied in a single worksheet with column headers and one row of data for each query identified.</p>

<p>A ‘Known Issues’ tab shows any changes or fixes we are applying to the data in the dashboard. This tab gives you information on the issue, how it affects your data, and when we expect to fix the issue by.</p>

<h2>Publication dates</h2>

<p>The landing page of the dashboard indicates when we will refresh the data each month in line with the dates published in column G (page 3) in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1093269/2223_ILR_Freeze_Schedule_v1.0.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Individualised Learner Record">ILR</abbr> freeze schedule 2022 to 2023.</a></p>

  <li>Apprenticeships</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relevant guidance</h3>

<p><strong>Adult education budget</strong> - we will not fund a learner to repeat the same regulated qualification where they have previously achieved it. The exceptions are for any GCSE where the learner has not achieved grade C, or 4, or higher.</p>

<p><strong>Apprenticeships</strong> - you must account for prior learning and experience when negotiating a price with the employer. You must reduce the content, duration, and price, where the individual has prior learning necessary to achieve the apprenticeship. Funds must not be used to pay for skills already attained by the apprentice.</p>

<h3>What you need to do (providers)</h3>

<p>Correct data, learner is ineligible.</p>

<p><strong>For apprenticeships starting on or after 1 May 2017</strong> (excluding English and maths), the negotiated price must reflect the prior learning identified. You must be able to demonstrate that enough learning is still required to meet the required minimum duration.</p>

<p><strong>For advanced learner loans,</strong> you must remove the Advanced Learner Loans Indicator (ADL) from the learning aim record and contact the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> to cancel the loan if the learner was required to take out a loan in error.</p>

<p><strong>For any other learning aims,</strong> you must recode the aims with Funding model code 99 or follow provider support manual guidance on correcting data errors after hard close of the previous year (aims with an incorrect funding model).</p>

<h3>What we will do</h3>

<p>If there are errors outstanding in this report at R14, we will recover any funding overclaim.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For provision funded through a grant, this value will be recorded as an adjustment against your reconciliation statement. Provisional error values will be used for your year-end funding claim to alert you to any potential impact on your final position at R14.</p>

<h2>FRM30 - Learners with more than 35 planned hours a week</h2>

<h3>Changes from previous funding year</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Funding streams reviewed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>16 to 19 study programmes</li>
  <li>16 to 18 traineeships</li>
  <li>T levels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relevant guidance</h3>

<p>Planned hours must take place in line with the institution’s normal working pattern.</p>

<p>The number of hours a student may study should not be greater than the legal maximum of 40 hours per week and both the study programme’s planned hours and planned dates will need to reflect this.</p>

<p>If the student is on a study programme that spans more than one funding year, the planned hours recorded in the data return must be set at the start of each funding year to only reflect the planned hours for the funding year.</p>

<h3>What you need to do (providers)</h3>

<p>Review evidence, correct as necessary.</p>

<p>You must adjust the planned learning hours to ensure that the learner is not studying more than 40 hours per week.</p>

<p>If the student is on a study programme that spans more than one funding year, the planned hours recorded in the data return must be set at the start of each funding year to only reflect the planned hours for the funding year.</p>

<h2>FRM37 – Apprenticeship off-the-job training hours below the minimum</h2>

<h3>Changes from previous funding year</h3>

<p>Updated to incorporate updated funding rules for new starts from 1 August 2022.</p>

<h3>Funding streams reviewed</h3>

<p>Apprenticeships from May 2017</p>

<h3>Relevant guidance</h3>

<p>For starts from 1 August 2022: to be eligible for government funding at least 20% of the apprentice’s normal working hours, capped at 30 hours per week (for funding purposes only), over the planned duration of the apprenticeship practical period, must be spent on off-the-job training. For apprentices working 30 hours or more per week, this is an average of 6 hours of off-the-job training per week (i.e. 20% of 30 hours) over the planned duration.</p>

<p>For starts prior to 1 August 2022: to be eligible for government funding at least 20% of the apprentice’s normal working hours, over the planned duration of the apprenticeship practical period, must be spent on off-the-job training.</p>

<p>For all apprentices: the minimum requirement for a part-time apprentice is 20% of their normal working hours over an extended duration.</p>

<p>English and maths training, up to and including level 2, does <strong>not</strong> count towards the minimum 20% off-the-job training requirement; where required this must be delivered in addition to the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>We will fully fund individuals, including individuals who are employed, aged 19 or older, who have not previously attained a GCSE grade 4 (C), or higher, in English and maths, as part of their legal entitlement on the day they start the following qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GCSE English language or maths</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functional Skills English or maths from Entry to level 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stepping-stone qualifications (including components, where applicable) in English or maths approved by <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a learner has already achieved their GCSE English and/or maths at grade 4 (C), or higher, they have met their entitlement in that subject and are ineligible for further funding.</p>

<h3>What you need to do (providers)</h3>

<p>Correct data, learner is ineligible.</p>

<p>You must recode the aims with Funding model code 99 or follow provider support manual guidance on correcting data errors after hard close of the previous year (aims with an incorrect funding model).</p>

<h2>FRM42 - Work experience over 300 hours not recorded as core aim</h2>

<h3>Changes from previous funding year</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Funding streams reviewed</h3>

<ul>
  <li>16 to 19 study programmes</li>
  <li>16 to 18 traineeships</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relevant guidance</h3>

<p>The core aim is the most important or central element of the programme, around which the rest of the programme is built. It will usually be the component with the largest amount of timetabled activity associated with it and will usually reflect the primary focus of the programme in line with the student’s intended destination (such as employment or further study) at the end of their programme.</p>

<p>16 to 18 traineeships must always have work experience as the core aim. Study programmes that are not traineeships may also have work experience as the core aim.</p>

<h3>What you need to do (providers)</h3>

<p>Review evidence, correct as necessary.</p>

<p>If you are not delivering a more substantial qualification as part of the learner’s programme, you must report work experience aims of this size as the core aim.</p>

<p>Traineeships must have work experience recorded as the core aim.</p>
