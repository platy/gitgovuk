<p>Welcome to the December 2020 edition of the HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Trusts and Estates Newsletter.</p>

<p>We do not have a mailing list for the newsletter.</p>

<h2>Extension of the Trust Registration Service</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/991/pdfs/uksi_20200991_en.pdf" rel="external">Regulations</a> bringing in an expansion to the Trust Registration Service (<abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr>) were laid in Parliament on 15 September 2020 and came into force on 6 October 2020. This will require the registration of UK express trusts, and non-UK express trusts in certain circumstances, regardless of tax consequence.</p>

<p>It is not yet possible to register non-taxpaying trusts on <abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr>. We are currently in the development phase of extending <abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr> to include functionality to register non-taxable trusts.</p>

<p>To help <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> in developing this aspect of the service, we are looking to speak to people who have set up a trust or are a trustee for a trust that is non-taxable. Do you or anyone you know have a trust that falls into this category? We would also like to hear from you if you are an agent who will be registering a trust that is non-taxable, on behalf of a client. If you are interested in participating in user research, now or in the future, please contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:serviceteam17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk">serviceteam17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will shortly be providing more information on GOV.UK about the extension of the <abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr> as a result of the Fifth anti-money laundering directive (5MLD). This will include an overview of the new rules, links to relevant documents, detail of the types of trusts that will be required to register, and information on what will be needed to complete the registration process or update the details of trusts that have already been registered.</p>

<p>We are currently considering the most effective approaches for reaching unrepresented trustees to raise awareness of the new requirement to register express trusts. If you have any suggestions about how we might best do this or which channels would be most effective, please contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:serviceteam17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk">serviceteam17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Trust Registration micro service</h2>

<p>The Trust Registration micro service is fully functional for taxpaying trusts. You should use it now to register, update details, declare “no change”, or close all types of taxpaying Trusts and Estates.</p>

<p>You can access the micro service on GOV.UK using the following links:</p>

<h3>For Trusts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-a-trust-as-a-trustee">register a trust as a trustee</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-your-clients-trust">register your clients trust</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-trusts-registration-service">manage your trusts registration service</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>For Estates</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/returns-for-someone-who-has-died">self-assessment tax returns for someone who has died</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-your-clients-estate">register your clients estate</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These links will take you to the relevant landing page. To launch the micro service, select the green “start now” button.</p>

<p>The original ‘iForm’ service has now been decommissioned and it is no longer possible to use this version of the service.</p>

<h2>Changes to GOV.UK guidance for the Trust Registration Service</h2>

<p>Based on customer feedback, we have made a number of further changes to the GOV.UK pages on trust registration and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-trusts-registration-service">managing the trust details</a>, including step by step guidance on the agent authorisation process. We will add further detail on trust and estate closures shortly.</p>

<h2>When to apply for a grant of representation</h2>

<p>To avoid delays in getting your grant of representation, make sure you do not apply too early.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is currently meeting its targets of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processing form IHT400s within 15 working days of receipt</li>
  <li>issuing the form IHT421 within 15 working days of receiving the form IHT400 or payment of the tax due on delivery of the account, whichever is later</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to allow time for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to process the IHT400 before applying for your grant. Doing this means that your IHT421 will be with HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) and can be matched to your probate application shortly after you apply.</p>

<p>We recommend that you allow 20 working days from the date you sent your IHT400 before applying for your grant.</p>

<p>If you apply for your grant too early HMCTS will not be able to match your application with the IHT421 and this will lead to delays in getting your grant.</p>
