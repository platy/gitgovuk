<h2>Trust Registration Service Deadlines</h2>

<p>The deadline for registering most trusts on the Trust Registration Service (<abbr title="Trust Registration Service">TRS</abbr>) is 1 September 2022.</p>

<h3>Trusts that are not taxable</h3>

<p>The deadline for registrations for non-taxable trusts in existence on 6
October 2020 is 1 September 2022, this also applies even if the trust
has since been closed.</p>

<p>Non-taxable trusts created after 6 October 2020 must register within 90
days of being created or otherwise becoming registerable, or by 1
September 2022 (whichever is later).</p>

<h3>Taxable trusts created on or after 6 April 2021</h3>

<p>Taxable trusts must register within 90 days of the trust becoming liable
for tax or by 1 September 2022 (whichever is later).</p>

<p>There are different registration deadlines for taxable trusts that were
created before 6 April 2021, guidance for these types of trusts can be
found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/personal-tax/trusts">Trust and Estates: detailed
information</a></p>

<p>More information on the trusts that need to register and the trusts that
are excluded from the requirement to register can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/personal-tax/trusts">Trusts
and Estates: detailed
information</a>. Further
detailed technical information can also be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/trust-registration-service-manual">Trust
Registration Service
Manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account</h2>

<h3>Guidance for the Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account  </h3>

<p>Detailed guidance on the Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account
to report and pay Capital Gains Tax due on disposals of UK Property was published on
17 December 2021 and updated on 16 January 2022 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg-app18">Appendix
18</a>
of the  Capital Gains Tax Manual.</p>

<p>This guidance provides further information on accessing and submitting
the Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account, and the interaction between the Capital Gains Tax on
UK Property Account and Self Assessment, for UK and non-UK
residents, agents, personal representatives and trustees.</p>

<h3>Self Assessment and  Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account</h3>

<p>When a customer comes to make an Self Assessment return and realises they should have
made a  Capital Gains Tax on UK property return during the tax year (30/60 days from
the date of completion), they should first submit a Capital Gains Tax on UK property
return before submitting an Self Assessment return.</p>

<h2>Addresses for administration of estates post</h2>

<p>To prevent delays in post regarding tax on income and gains (other than
the Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account) during the post-death administration
period reaching the appropriate teams, please use the correct postal
addresses.</p>

<p>You should address items to ‘HMRC Administration of Estates’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>BX9 1EL, United Kingdom — for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/probate-estate/reporting-the-estate">complex
estates</a>
correspondence including appeals and Trust and Estate returns SA900</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BX9 1AS, United Kingdom — for informal procedures notifications</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to add a building name or town. Couriers should use a
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/couriers">different address</a>.</p>

<p>Do not use these addresses for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/probate-and-inheritance-tax-enquiries">Inheritance Tax
correspondence</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do when someone dies step-by-step guide</h2>

<p>The step-by-step GOV.UK guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">What to do when someone
dies</a>
has recently been updated.</p>

<p>Updates include a replacement section at ‘Step 6 Deal with the estate’
for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/probate-estate">Dealing with an estate of someone who’s
died</a>. This new section consolidates
information for personal representatives managing the administration
period.</p>

<p>There are also consequential changes to the ‘Self Assessment returns
when someone dies’ guidance to reduce duplication.</p>

<p>These updates follow on from changes to the content at ‘Step 5 Apply
for probate and check if you need to pay Inheritance tax’. The Probate
and Inheritance Tax guidance pages were updated to reflect the reporting
requirements process for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/excepted-estates-1-january-2022">deaths on or after 1 January
2022</a>.</p>

<h2>Inheritance Tax GOV.UK detailed guidance</h2>

<p>In recent months, reviews of the Inheritance Tax detailed guidance pages
GOV.UK have also led to the following pages being updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-inheritance-tax-due-on-gifts">Work out Inheritance Tax due on
gifts</a></li>

<h2>Improvements to our timeline for form IHT100s for Trust and Lifetime charges</h2>

<p>In HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20191207165444/https:/www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-trusts-and-estates-newsletters/hmrc-trusts-and-estates-newsletter-special-edition-april-2018" rel="external">April 2018 Trusts and Estates
Newsletter</a>
we told you about changes we were making to the way we handle form
IHT400 to improve our processing and the length of time until you can
expect to hear if we have any questions about your account. The
introduction of that approach was welcomed by the Office of Tax
Simplification in its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/office-of-tax-simplification-inheritance-tax-review">first report on Inheritance
Tax</a>
in November 2018 and they recommended that HMRC consider introducing a
similar review period for form IHT100 for Trust and Lifetime Inheritance
Tax charges.</p>

<h3>What to expect from us</h3>

<p>We will write to you and let you know we have received your form IHT100
and provide you with a date 12 weeks in the future by which you can
expect to hear from us if we have any questions. If you do not hear from
us by the date given, then you can assume that we do not have any
questions.</p>

<p>This guidance applies to forms IHT100 received after 20 April 2022.</p>

<h2>Changes to the process for clearance for Trust and Lifetime charges form IHT100s</h2>

<p>In cases where we tell you we have opened a compliance check into a form
IHT100, we will write to tell you when the compliance check is ended. In
other cases, we will not issue a standard clearance letter. If you want
to apply for clearance, you should use form IHT30 ‘Application for a
clearance certificate’.</p>

<p>Where the form IHT100 relates to a transfer arising during the lifetime
of the transferor we may not be able to issue a clearance certificate as
a future event may change the tax due in respect of that transfer. More
detail about how we deal with clearance certificates in different
circumstances are set out in 
More detail about how we deal with clearance certificates in different circumstances are set out in chapter 40 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm40040">IHTM40000 - Procedures for dealing with an application for clearance: is a certificate appropriate</a>.</p>

<h3>How to avoid delays</h3>

<p>We may not be able to deal with your form IHT100 if you have not given
us all the information we need. You can avoid delays and questions from
us by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making sure that you answer all relevant questions in the form
IHT100</li>
  <li>taking care when you tell us which schedules are included and making
sure they are completed and enclosed</li>
  <li>enclosing a copy of relevant documents if they are requested.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of form C4 corrective accounts</h2>

<p>We have been receiving an increased number of C4 corrective account
forms reporting a decrease in the value of listed stocks and shares, and
land and buildings. Where this decrease is the result of a sale the C4
corrective account should not be used.</p>

<p>Form IHT35 should be used if you wish to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm34011">claim relief on shares or
securities</a>
that were part of the deceased’s estate and were sold at a loss within
12 months of the date of death (where the gross sale price of all shares
sold is less than the value returned on the form IHT400).</p>

<p>Form IHT38 should be used if you wish to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm33011">claim relief on land or
buildings</a>
that were part of the deceased’s estate and were sold at a loss within 4
years of the date of death (where the gross sale price is less than the
value returned on the form IHT400).</p>

<p>The C4 corrective account should only be used to report amendments to the value of assets and liabilities
returned in the form IHT400 where it is discovered that the date of
death value was incorrect and to report assets or liabilities not
previously returned on the form IHT400.</p>
