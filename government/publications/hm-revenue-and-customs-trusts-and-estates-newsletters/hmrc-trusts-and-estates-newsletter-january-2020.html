<p>Welcome to the January 2020 edition of the HMRC Trusts and Estates Newsletter.</p>

<p>We do not have a mailing list for the newsletter.</p>

<h2>Capital Gains Tax payment for property disposal</h2>

<p>From April 2020 the rules are changing for UK residents related to the payment of Capital Gains Tax due on disposal of a UK residential property, which is not a principle private residence, that’s the home you live in which is fully covered by Private Residence Relief. Where there is a gain and tax due, the disposal must be reported and tax paid to HMRC within 30 days of completion of the disposal.</p>

<p>The rules for non-UK residents are changing slightly in that disposals of UK residential and non-residential property must be reported and tax paid within 30 days of the disposal, regardless of whether there is a gain or a loss, and for Self Assessment customers there will no longer be deferral of payment to the Self Assessment tax return.</p>

<p>HMRC is developing a new micro service to allow customers to report and pay Capital Gains Tax for property disposal. Customers who are already within Self Assessment will still need to report the gain on their tax return. Customers who are not in Self Assessment and have a ‘one-off’ disposal will be able to remain outside of the Self Assessment process as long as there is no other reason for them to be part of it. Customers should check GOV.UK guidance if they are unsure as to whether they should be within Self Assessment or not.</p>

<p>The new service will be available on GOV.UK from April 2020.</p>

<h2>Trust Registration Service</h2>

<p>All agents and trustees who need to register a taxable trust should do so where possible on the new ‘micro-service’ version of the Trust Registration Service . Where a Trust has already registered with HMRC, the features to view this data and declare there are “no changes” is also available. This new version of the service cannot be accessed via the link on gov.uk as it is currently only open to invited users whilst it is in the ‘private beta’ phase of development. You can obtain access by contacting the Trust Registration Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:service_team17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk">service_team17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Work is continuing in respect of further features in the new version of the service and we will provide further information during the course of development.</p>

<h2>Fifth anti-money laundering directive (<abbr title="Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive">5MLD</abbr>) and the extension of the Trust Registration Service update</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-trusts-and-estates-newsletters/hmrc-trusts-and-estates-newsletter-august-2019">August 2019 edition</a> of this newsletter stated the government was reviewing the responses to the consultation published on 15 April 2019, entitled ‘Transposition of the fifth money laundering directive’, which invited views on the government’s proposals to implement the directive. Over 200 responses were received from a range of stakeholders. The government is grateful for the information received and has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/transposition-of-the-fifth-money-laundering-directive">published its response</a> on 23 January 2020.</p>

<p>The regulations to transpose <abbr title="Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive">5MLD</abbr> came into force on 10 January 2020. The amendments relevant to the expanded trust register were not included in these regulations, to enable a technical consultation to take place.</p>

<p>The technical consultation was published on 24 January 2020 and includes the draft legislation and additional information on the proposals, including the scope of the register, data collection and sharing, and penalties. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/technical-consultation-fifth-money-laundering-directive-and-trust-registration-service">consultation</a> closes on 21 February 2020.</p>

<h2>Estate registration – personal representatives</h2>

<p>Personal representatives currently use the Trust Registration Service to obtain a Unique Taxpayers Reference (<abbr title="Unique Taxpayers Reference">UTR</abbr>) for new complex estates which are required to submit trust and estates tax returns.</p>

<p>Any complex estates which already have a <abbr title="Unique Taxpayers Reference">UTR</abbr>, are not required to use the online service at this time. The facility to update the information held by HMRC for complex estates, for example changing a personal representatives name or address or advising HMRC that an estate has ceased, will soon be available.</p>

<p>If personal representatives or agents use Google Chrome, any information previously provided may have been saved automatically if this feature is turned on. Please check the information is correct before submission as we are aware some estates have had the county name from the address field incorrectly transposed as the estate name. We have corrected the estate records affected so far.</p>

<h2>Changes to the Direct Payment Scheme – IHT423 update</h2>

<p>National Savings &amp; Investments (<abbr title="National Savings &amp; Investments">NS&amp;I</abbr>) have joined the Direct Payment Scheme, simplifying the process to pay some or all of the <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> if the person who died had money in <abbr title="National Savings &amp; Investments">NS&amp;I</abbr> accounts.</p>

<p>The updated process aligns <abbr title="National Savings &amp; Investments">NS&amp;I</abbr> accounts with the process for other bank or building society accounts. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inheritance-tax-direct-payment-scheme-bank-or-building-society-account-iht423">IHT423 form</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/730319/IHT400_Notes_0618_online.pdf" rel="external">guidance</a> has been amended so that you can request money to be transferred directly from the deceased’s bank, building society, or <abbr title="National Savings &amp; Investments">NS&amp;I</abbr> accounts to HMRC.</p>

<h2>Agent toolkits</h2>

<p>Tax agents and advisers play an important role in helping their clients to complete their tax returns correctly, but many agents do not complete a large number of trust and estate returns, as it is a specialised area.</p>

<p>HMRC have 19 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tax-agents-toolkits">agent toolkits</a> for you to download and use. They are a free online resource aimed at helping to avoid the most common errors seen in returns filed by agents.</p>

<p>The toolkits are updated yearly to reflect changes in the relevant Finance Act.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-trusts-and-estates-toolkit">Trusts and Estates toolkit</a> helps and supports tax agents and advisers for whom trusts and estates is not a significant element of their practice’s work. Other agents may still find the toolkit helpful in validating their approach to this work and anyone, including businesses, trustees, and personal representatives may find the toolkit useful if they are completing a Trust and Estate Tax Return.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-capital-gains-tax-for-trusts-and-estates-supplementary-toolkit-2013-to-2014">Capital Gains Tax for trusts and estates toolkit</a> helps and supports tax agents and advisers by providing guidance on the errors we find commonly occur in relation to Capital Gains Tax for trusts and estates and supplements the main toolkit for trusts and estates. Use this toolkit if you need to complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-trust-and-estate-capital-gains-sa905">form SA905</a> Trust and Estate Capital Gains supplementary pages. If there has been a chargeable gain in the period the return covers, or you are not sure whether Capital Gains Tax applies, use both toolkits.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-inheritance-tax-toolkit">Inheritance Tax (<abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr>) toolkit</a> assists you with completing <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> Account form IHT400. The toolkit may be helpful when completing the excepted estate forms IHT205 or C5 (for Scotland) as many of the considerations, such as valuation, also apply to these.</p>
