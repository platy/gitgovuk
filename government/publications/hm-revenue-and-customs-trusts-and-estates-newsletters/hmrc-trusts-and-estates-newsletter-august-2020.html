<p>Welcome to the August 2020 edition of the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Trusts and Estates Newsletter.</p>

<p>We do not have a mailing list for the newsletter.</p>

<h2>Fifth anti-money laundering directive (5MLD) and the extension of the Trust Registration Service update</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-revenue-and-customs-trusts-and-estates-newsletters/hmrc-trusts-and-estates-newsletter-january-2020#fifth-anti-money-laundering-directive-5mld-and-the-extension-of-the-trust-registration-service-update">January 2020 edition</a> of this newsletter told readers that a consultation was published on 24 January 2020, entitled ‘Technical consultation: Fifth money laundering directive and Trust Registration Service’. This consultation closed on 21 February 2020.</p>

<p>The government published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/technical-consultation-fifth-money-laundering-directive-and-trust-registration-service">summary of responses</a> to this technical consultation on 15 July 2020. The government received 124 written responses and held a number of meetings with stakeholders during the consultation period and is grateful for the engagement of stakeholders throughout and responses received.</p>

<p>The associated regulations have been put before the European Statutory Instruments Committee and will be laid before Parliament later this year. You can find the details in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-withdrawal-act-2018-statutory-instruments/the-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-amendment-eu-exit-regulations-2020">Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a>.</p>

<p>It is not yet possible to register non-taxpaying trusts on Trust Registration Service. The government is in the process of updating the Trust Registration Service IT system to accommodate the new requirements set out within the regulations. We will provide guidance about when and how trustees will be able to register in due course. Trustees will then have until 10 March 2022 to comply with this requirement.</p>

<p>Taxable trusts required to register on Trust Registration Service under the current rules should continue to follow the existing Trust Registration Service registration guidance and deadlines until advised by HMRC to do otherwise.</p>

<h2>Volunteers needed</h2>

<p>HMRC are continuing to work on the development of the Trust Registration Service IT system to accommodate the required changes as a result of 5MLD. This includes extending the functionality to register non-taxable trusts.
To help HMRC in developing this aspect of the service, we are looking to speak to people who have set up a trust or are a trustee for a trust that is not liable to pay tax.</p>

<p>Do you or anyone you know have a trust that falls into this category? If so and you are interested in participating in user research, contact: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:service_team17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk">service_team17.digital_ddcn@digital.hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Registrations</h2>

<p>The original ‘iForm’ version of the service will no longer be accessible from 23 September 2020. It will not be possible to register a trust or estate using this version after this date. This means you should finish any partially completed registrations started on the original service before it becomes unavailable.</p>

<p>You should start to use the new ‘micro-service’ version of the service to register all types of taxable trust or ‘complex’ estates. The new version is more intuitive and user friendly, displays only the parts of the service that are relevant to users based on their responses, has improved navigation and is accessibility compliant.</p>

<p>We will update the link in the trust registration guidance on GOV.UK so that it directs users to the ‘micro-service’ version for all registrations, rather than to the original iForm-based service.</p>

<h2>Updating trust details</h2>

<p>You can now update details on Trust Registration Service if any of the information about the trust or the beneficial owners you gave at registration changes and the trust is liable to tax. This includes changes to the trustees, beneficiaries, settlor, protector or other individual who can control the trust. You do not need to update Trust Registration Service with changes to the assets in the trust or their values at registration.</p>

<p>Now that the update functions are available on Trust Registration Service, make sure the details on the register are correct and that any changes to the persons associated with the trust since registration are reflected on the register.</p>

<h2>Declaration</h2>

<p>You can now make a declaration on Trust Registration Service to confirm that the details of the persons associated with the trust are accurate and up to date. You must do this using the online service and it’s important that you do so, even if there are no changes, if the trustees are liable to pay one or more of the relevant taxes for any tax year.</p>

<p>If the trustees are not liable to pay tax in a tax year, you do not have to make the declaration until the trust becomes liable to tax again.</p>

<h2>Deadlines</h2>

<p>Any changes to the details on the register (other than those relating to the trust assets), or a confirmation that no changes are needed, must be made by the following deadlines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the change occurred before 6 April 2020 (or there was no change) and the trustees were liable to tax for any of those tax years – by 31 January 2021.</li>
  <li>if the change occurs in 2020-21 (or there is no change) and the trustees are liable to tax in that tax year – by 31 January 2022.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the trustees are not liable to pay any relevant tax for a tax year, the updating and confirmation of no changes deadline is extended to 31 January after the tax year in which the trustees become liable to pay tax again.</p>

<h2>Question 20 on the SA900 tax return</h2>

<p>As the facility to update details or declare no changes is now available on Trust Registration Service, you should use the online service instead of telling HMRC of any changes, or confirming that there are none, by letter or by making a note on the return. Tick box 20.1 on the return to confirm that you have provided the updated details or that you have confirmed on Trust Registration Service that there have been no changes. The previous advice in the December 2018 edition of this newsletter that box 20.1 can be left blank no longer applies.</p>

<p>You should not send a letter to HMRC, or make a note on the white space in the SA900 tax return, to give details of changes or confirm that there are no changes to the trust details.</p>

<h2>Closing a trust</h2>

<p>It is now possible to note on Trust Registration Service that a trust has ended. If the trust has come to an end, make sure this is reflected on the Trust Registration Service.</p>

<h2>Agent authorisation</h2>

<p>If you’re an agent acting on behalf of a client, before you can view or change the details about the trust you gave at registration, you must have authorisation from your client. The existing form 64-8 does not give an agent the authority to use Trust Registration Service.</p>

<p>You and your client must set up the authorisation online. This is a one-off action for you and your client involving a few simple steps and is in line with HMRC agent authorisation standards. You can find details of how to do this on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-your-clients-trust">Register a trust as an agent</a> guidance page. Trustees can also find guidance about what they need to do on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-a-trust-as-a-trustee">Register a trust as a trustee</a> guidance page.</p>

<p>We are aware that some trustees and agents have had difficulties going through the authorisation process.</p>

<p>You may find the following helpful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trustees will need a separate Government Gateway account with an organisation user ID and password for each trust that they manage – this is a requirement of the Government Gateway process and is in line with how it works for other HMRC online services</li>
  <li>trustees who need to set up a Government Gateway account should go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-trusts-registration-service">Manage your trust’s details</a> page and select the ‘Start now’ link to access the correct Government Gateway portal then select the ‘create sign in details’ and follow the instructions to get a user ID and set up a password</li>
  <li>trustees will then need to ‘claim’ their trust by answering a few questions about it before their agent can create a link to the invitation that they email to their client</li>
  <li>trustees must select the link within 7 days and accept the invitation to authorise their agent</li>
  <li>agents need to access their Agent Services Account using the ‘Start now’ link on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-trusts-registration-service">Manage your trust’s details</a> page, not by the general Agent Services route</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be revising the guidance on GOV.UK to make it easier to find and to explain the process more clearly.
Clients who genuinely cannot carry out this process digitally because, for example, they do not have access to a computer should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/trusts">Trusts and Estates Helpline</a> who will assess their needs and give the appropriate level of support. Lead trustees who may not feel confident about using the online service may also ask another trustee to go through the agent authorisation process.</p>

<h2>Complex estates</h2>

<p>The facility to update information provided at registration for ‘complex’ estates is also now available. This includes changes to the personal representative’s name, address and to close the estate record on Trust Registration Service.</p>

<h2>GOV.UK guidance changes</h2>

<p>We have made a number of changes to our GOV.UK pages on trust registration.</p>

<p>A new overview ‘When you must register a trust’ has been added to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/trusts-taxes">Trusts and taxes</a> guide. More details for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-your-clients-trust">agents</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-a-trust-as-a-trustee">trustees</a> on how to register a trust as well as guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-your-trusts-registration-service">managing the trust details</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>We will continue to review our guidance and act on customer feedback to make improvements where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Finance Bill 2020</h2>

<p>On 22 July 2020 the Finance Bill received Royal Assent and became the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/14/contents/enacted" rel="external">Finance Act 2020</a>. The measures that affect Inheritance Tax (<abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr>) are in sections 73-75 and 102.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Excluded property</h3>

<p>Foreign assets in a trust are excluded from <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> charges if the settlor was not domiciled or deemed to be domiciled in the UK when the trust was made.</p>

<p>Legislation has been introduced to confirm HMRC’s existing view that the settlor’s domicile must be tested whenever assets are added to the trust and not just when the trust was first made. Legislation has also been introduced which provides that where assets are transferred between trusts, in order to be excluded from an <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> charge, the original settlor must be non-domiciled both when the trust was made and when the assets are transferred between the trusts.</p>

<p>The Inheritance Tax Manual is in the process of being updated and will incorporate the changes made by these measures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> New reliefs for payments received under Compensation Schemes and other Schemes</h3>

<p>Relief from <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> is available in respect of payments received under the Windrush Compensation Scheme, Kindertransport Fund and The Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme if particular requirements are met.</p>

<p>The guidance for the reliefs is in the Inheritance Tax Manuals <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm04142">IHTM04142</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm04422">IHTM04422</a>.</p>

<p>Read more information for all the measures in the <a class="govuk-link" href="Finance%20Bill%202020%20legislation%20and%20explanatory%20notes">Finance Bill 2020 legislation and explanatory notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Electronic submission of IHT400 and IHT100 forms</h2>

<p>The dropbox facility for sending IHT400 and IHT100 accounts to HMRC was temporarily introduced as part of a larger suite of changes to enable customers to continue to comply with their obligations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions.</p>

<p>We thank those of you who took part in the short trial of this electronic facility. This has allowed those in genuine need, who cannot use the postal system, to submit their account. However we have seen the number of accounts submitted by post revert to the usual volumes, and we are currently processing accounts and dealing with post in line with published targets. Your feedback and participation enabled us to prove the concept and we now have a far better understanding of what would be required to deliver a permanent electronic alternative.</p>

<p>We therefore recommend that all customers who are able to file <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> accounts via the postal system should again do so.</p>

<p>As a result, we will only be issuing a link to the dropbox facility upon request and by exception, where that request outlines why a specific account cannot be submitted by post. We will not be offering this facility for general filing in the foreseeable future, however we continue to explore avenues to improve the customer journey and reduce the administration burden on customers.</p>

<h2>New clearance letter and process</h2>

<p>To prevent delays we are making changes to the current process for handling forms IHT30 –‘Application for a clearance certificate’. Instead of returning a stamped and signed copy of the form IHT30 we will send customers a letter to certify that the Commissioners of HM Revenue and Customs discharge the applicants who have signed the form.</p>

<p>In place of our usual stamp, HMRC will use a unique authorisation code. The letter will have exactly the same effect as the stamped and signed IHT30.</p>

<h2>Operational update</h2>

<p>Despite continuing challenges presented by coronavirus, operational areas in <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> and Trusts are currently meeting all key targets and processing post and new accounts within published turnaround times. Volumes of post and IHT400s have increased significantly recently, as have numbers of calls on both the <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> and Probate helplines.</p>

<h2>Confirmation of payee checks</h2>

<p>Some UK banks have recently introduced Confirmation of Payee (<abbr title="Confirmation of Payee">COP</abbr>) as a new way of giving individuals and organisations greater assurance that they are sending payments to the correct bank account. <abbr title="Confirmation of Payee">COP</abbr> introduces an additional check of the account name to avoid payments being sent to the wrong bank or building society account.</p>

<p>In line with these changes HMRC have now introduced <abbr title="Confirmation of Payee">COP</abbr> when issuing repayments by CHAPS or Faster Payments.</p>

<p>To avoid delays, make sure you provide HMRC with the account name, account number and sort code exactly as it appears on the bank statement for the account you want the money to be paid to. If the details you give are not correct, we may not be able to process your repayment straightaway.</p>

<h2>Estates and Capital Gains Tax Disposals</h2>

<p>If a personal representative has disposed of UK residential property which gives rise to a Capital Gains Tax liability they must report and pay the tax due within 30 days of the completion date.</p>

<p>This can be reported through the new Capital Gains Tax payment on property disposals service if this disposal occurs before they are ready to finalise the estate’s tax affairs. Or, if following the disposal of UK residential property which gives rise to a Capital Gains Tax liability, the personal representative is also ready to finalise the estate’s tax affairs in their entirety and pay any tax due, they can report and pay through the existing processes as set out on GOV.UK but still within the Capital Gains Tax payment on property disposals 30 day window. This may be done by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a Self Assessment return for the administration period if the estate meets the ‘complex estate’ criteria</li>
  <li>advising HMRC of the Capital Gains Tax due for the administration period through the ‘informal arrangements’ if it does not meet the complex estate criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>Estates do not have to have registered via the Trust Registration Service to be able to use the new Capital Gains Tax payment on property disposals service. However, if the personal representative already has a Unique Taxpayer Reference (<abbr title="Unique Taxpayer Reference">UTR</abbr>) for the estate, this can be used when filing on the Capital Gains Tax payment on property disposals Service. Where a ‘complex estate’ does not have a <abbr title="Unique Taxpayer Reference">UTR</abbr>, the personal representative will need to get one by registering on Trust Registration Service.</p>

<h2>Agent toolkits - annual refresh 2020</h2>

<p>Tax agents and advisers play an important role in helping their clients to get their tax returns correct, but many agents do not complete a large number of trust and estate returns, as it is a specialised area.</p>

<p>HMRC has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tax-agents-toolkits">19 agent toolkits</a> you can download and use. They are a free online resource aimed at helping you avoid the most common errors we see in returns filed by agents.</p>

<p>The toolkits are updated yearly to reflect changes in the relevant Finance Act.</p>

<p>Refreshed versions of both the main Trusts and Estates and supplementary Capital Gains Tax for trusts and estates toolkits were published in April.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-trusts-and-estates-toolkit">Trusts and Estates toolkit</a> helps and supports tax agents and advisers for whom trusts and estates is not a significant element of their practice’s work. Other agents may still find the toolkit helpful in validating their approach to this work and anyone, including businesses, trustees, and personal representatives may find the toolkit useful if they are completing a Trust and Estate Tax Return.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-capital-gains-tax-for-trusts-and-estates-supplementary-toolkit-2013-to-2014">Capital Gains Tax for trusts and estates toolkit</a> helps and supports tax agents and advisers by providing guidance on the errors we find commonly occur in relation to Capital Gains Tax for trusts and estates and supplements the main toolkit for trusts and estates. Use this toolkit if you need to complete form SA905 Trust and Estate Capital Gains supplementary pages. If there has been a chargeable gain in the period the return covers, or you are not sure whether Capital Gains Tax applies, use both toolkits.</p>

<p>We also refreshed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-inheritance-tax-toolkit">Inheritance Tax toolkit</a> to help you with completing <abbr title="Inheritance Tax">IHT</abbr> Account form IHT400. The toolkit may be helpful when completing the excepted estate forms IHT205 or C5 (for Scotland) as many of the considerations, such as valuation, also apply to these.</p>
