<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: updating the course directory with apprenticeship training offer</h2>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1051720/ESFA_Apprenticeship_Agreement_for_Training_Providers__January_2022_.pdf" rel="external">apprenticeship agreement</a>, main apprenticeship training providers are required to provide up to date information, through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data">Publish to the course directory</a>, about the apprenticeships they offer which are funded by the ESFA</p>

<p>Course Directory data and information is shared with employers when they use the ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-find-apprenticeship-training">Find apprenticeship training</a> online search facility, to find apprenticeship standards and identify approved providers that can deliver training.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-find-apprenticeship-training">Find apprenticeship training</a> provides information to employers about a training provider’s organisation and their apprenticeship offer, including the geographical areas they cover, helping to inform employer choice. It is important that this information is up to date so that employers and the ESFA have an accurate view of coverage of apprenticeship provision across all apprenticeships.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with your apprenticeship agreement, we are asking all providers to ensure their information is up to date and complete. You can add new apprenticeships, edit and update existing apprenticeships and remove those you no longer offer through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data">Publish to the course directory</a>.</p>

<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing funding is available to support schools and colleges that have incurred exceptional premises-related costs.</p>

<p>Allocations for the period 8 January to 18 February 2022 and for the extended period 19 February to 31 March 2022 for those special settings that were required to continue testing for a longer period are now available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: improvements and simplifications to apprenticeships from August 2022</h2>

<p>We are introducing a number of changes to apprenticeships through the 2022 to 2023 funding rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>We are making it simpler for individuals to accelerate their apprenticeship</strong>. By improving how providers assess prior learning and experience at the start of the programme – and funding providers to deliver a robust assessment – apprentices will be able to cut out training they do not require and complete their apprenticeship more quickly.</li>
  <li>
<strong>We are introducing a new minimum number of off-the-job training hours</strong>. From 1st August, the minimum time spent on off-the-job-training will no longer be linked to the apprentice’s working hours. Instead, we will have a consistent figure, irrespective of the hours worked by the apprentice. This will be 6 hours per week. This change will simplify the reporting for providers and create a level-playing field among apprentices who are on the same standard but working different hours.</li>
  <li>
<strong>We are changing English and maths requirements</strong> for those Level 2 apprentices who start with the lowest level of prior attainment in English and maths. People who start a L2 apprenticeship without L1 English and maths will no longer need to automatically attempt L2 English and Maths tests to complete their apprenticeship.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">The apprenticeship funding rules are published in draft on gov.uk</a> to give providers and employers an opportunity to provide feedback on how we can make them better understood. Please email any suggestions to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fundingrules.comments@education.gov.uk">fundingrules.comments@education.gov.uk</a> by 24 June 2022.</p>

<p>You can find a fuller description of these changes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/making-our-apprenticeship-system-simpler-for-employers-training-providers-and-apprentices">this news story on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: version 3 of the apprenticeship funding rules 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have issued <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">version 3 of the apprenticeship funding rules for 2021 to 2022</a>.</p>

<p>This is to reflect that a temporary exception to the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (RoATP) requirements for supporting providers (subcontractors) is being introduced to ease capacity challenges for training providers.</p>

<p>The rules also reflect that Ukrainians and their family members supported through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa">Ukraine Family Scheme</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-visa-under-the-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme">Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme">Ukraine Extension Scheme</a> are immediately eligible for apprenticeship funding and are exempt from the 3-year residency requirement as per the previous <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">apprenticeship funding rules</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: draft apprenticeship funding rules 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have issued the draft <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules#draft-rules-2022-to-2023">apprenticeship funding rules for 2022 to /2023</a>.</p>

<p>We are issuing these funding rules as a draft version to give you the opportunity to provide feedback on how we can make them clearer or better understood.</p>

<p>Please email any suggestions to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:fundingrules.comments@education.gov.uk">fundingrules.comments@education.gov.uk</a> by 24 June 2022. Following a review of any feedback, we will issue a final version of the rules in July.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: temporary exception to Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (RoATP) requirements for supporting providers (subcontractors) delivering training and testing for the acquisition of a driving licence</h2>

<p>In response to supply issues for driver training and testing in the transport sector we have introduced a temporary flexibility to support training providers to increase their capacity to deliver training and testing for the acquisition of a driving licence.</p>

<p>For a limited period, supporting providers (subcontractors) that exclusively deliver training and testing directly related to the acquisition of a driving licence on behalf of a lead provider do not need to be on the RoATP. To be eligible for the exception, the driving licence must be a mandatory requirement of the apprenticeship standard the lead provider is delivering.</p>

<p>The exception is in place from 25 May 2022 until 31 July 2023. Lead providers must submit an application form to the Department for Education to gain approval before subcontracting.</p>

<p>If a supporting provider (subcontractor) intends to deliver training not directly linked to licence acquisition they will need to apply to the supporting route on the RoATP.</p>

<p>Further details on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">how providers can utilise this exception and access the application form</a> can be found  on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: resetting reservation levels for employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy from 1 June 2022</h2>

<p>From 1 June 2022, the reservation levels for employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy will be reset, enabling each of these employers to make up to 10 new reservations on the apprenticeship service to fund new starts.</p>

<p>This reset will give employers who do not pay the levy greater certainty over their recruitment plans for the year ahead. It is made in recognition of the important role that SMEs play in creating apprenticeship opportunities, particularly for younger people and those in disadvantaged areas.</p>

<p>Any reservations made before 1 June 2022 will not be affected and will not count against the new reservation levels from this date.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manage-apprenticeship-funds#how-funding-works-if-you-do-not-pay-the-apprenticeship-levy">Further information on the changes is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
