<p>As required by section 43 of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (‘the Sanctions Act’), the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs has provided this guidance to assist in the implementation of, and compliance with, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/600/introduction/made" rel="external">the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019</a> (the ‘Regulations’), as amended from time to time.</p>

<p>The following instruments have made amendments to this instrument. If a consolidated version is not yet available on legislation.gov.uk, these instruments should be read alongside the original instrument:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/590/contents" rel="external">Sanctions (EU Exit) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No.2) Regulations 2020</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>As required by the Sanctions Act, this document contains guidance on the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations. It additionally provides guidance on best practice for complying with the prohibitions and requirements; the enforcement of them; and circumstances where they do not apply.</p>

<p>This document is intended to be read alongside more detailed sanctions guidance published by departments including the Department for International Trade (DIT), Department for Transport, Home Office and HM Treasury, through the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). This document contains links to those key sources of sanctions guidance, which will be regularly maintained and updated on GOV.UK. It is designed to give an overview of the prohibitions and requirements in the Regulations and, where appropriate, direct readers to further detailed guidance. This document is current on the date of publication.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019</h2>

<p>The Regulations impose financial, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions for the purposes of encouraging the Government of Belarus to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respect democratic principles and institutions and the separation of powers and the rule of law in Belarus</li>
  <li>refrain from actions, policies or activities which repress civil society in Belarus</li>
  <li>investigate properly and institute criminal proceedings against persons responsible for the disappearances of Yury Zakharanka, Viktar Hanchar, Anatol Krasouski and Dzmitry Zavadski</li>
  <li>comply with international human rights law and respect human rights</li>
  <li>cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine, including by supporting or facilitating Russia’s actions in respect of Ukraine</li>
  <li>refrain from any other action that undermines or threatens peace, security or stability in Europe</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to achieve the stated purposes, the Regulations impose a number of prohibitions and requirements. In order to enforce these, the Regulations establish penalties and offences.</p>

<p>The prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations apply within the territory of the United Kingdom (UK) (including Northern Ireland) and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world. UK persons include British nationals, as well as all bodies incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the UK. Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas.</p>

<p>The maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 9 of the Regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters.</p>

<p>It is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent certain prohibitions imposed by the Regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions.</p>

<p>If you are unclear about any aspect of the Regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the Regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.</p>

<p>Prohibitions and requirements for the financial, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions contained in the Regulations are set out below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Designation of persons</h3>

<p>The Regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons by name for the purposes of immigration sanctions and/or certain financial, aircraft, shipping or trade sanctions, if they are an involved person (as defined in regulation 6).</p>

<p>The Regulations also make provision for the Secretary of State to provide that persons of a specified description are designated persons for the above purposes.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list">UK Sanctions List</a> lists the people designated under the Regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Financial sanctions</h3>

<h4>Asset freeze and making available provisions</h4>

<p>The Regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>More <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs">information on financial sanctions</a> can be found in the OFSI guidance.</p>

<p>OFSI is the authority responsible for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury.  OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-financial-sanctions-implementation">how OFSI implements financial sanctions</a> can be found on the OFSI pages of GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Other financial and investment restrictions</h4>

<p>It is prohibited to deal with transferable security or money-market instruments issued by a broad range of entities and individuals connected with Belarus and the government of Belarus including those issued by:</p>

<ul>

  <li>a person connected with Belarus (this is defined in regulation 2(2) and is subject to the exclusions in regulation 15B(2C)(a))</li>
  <li>an entity majority owned by a person connected with Belarus</li>
</ul>

<h4>Loan and credit arrangements</h4>

<p>The Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly granting, or entering into an arrangement to grant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a loan or credit with a maturity exceeding 90 days, granted after noon on 9 August 2021 and before 5 July 2022 to a “relevant person” (as set out above), which is classed as a category A loan</li>
  <li>a loan or credit on or after 5 July 2022 to a “relevant person” (as set out above), which is classed as a category B loan</li>
  <li>a loan or credit on or after 5 July 2022 with a maturity exceeding 30 days granted to a person connected with Belarus (this is defined in regulation 2(2), and is subject the exclusions in regulation 15B(5)), which is classed as a category C loan</li>
</ul>

<h4>Insurance and reinsurance services</h4>

<p>A person must not provide insurance or reinsurance services to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Belarus</li>
  <li>a Belarusian authority (as defined in regulation 15D(1))</li>
  <li>an entity wholly owned by Belarus or a Belarusian authority</li>
  <li>anyone acting on their behalf or at their direction</li>
</ul>

<p>This prohibition does not apply to persons who are in charge of a ship or aircraft and who are temporarily acting at the direction of the Belarusian authorities etc, for certain specified purposes.</p>

<h4>Provision of financial services for the purpose of foreign exchange reserve and asset management</h4>

<p>The Regulations prohibit a UK individual or entity from providing financial services for the purpose of foreign exchange reserve and asset management to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the National Bank of Belarus</li>
  <li>the Ministry of Finance of Belarus</li>
  <li>a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any of the persons above; or</li>
  <li>a person acting on behalf of or at the direction of any of the persons above</li>
</ul>

<p>“Foreign exchange reserve and asset management” means activities relating to the reserves or assets of the persons listed above. Such reserves or assets include money market instruments (including cheques, bills and certificates of deposit); foreign exchange; derivative products (including futures and options); exchange rate and interest rate instruments (including products such as swaps and forward rate agreements); transferable securities; other negotiable instruments and financial assets (including bullion); and special drawing rights.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Trade sanctions</h3>

<p>The Regulations impose trade prohibitions relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>military goods and military technology (as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3231/schedule/2/crossheading/military-security-and-paramilitary-goods-software-and-technology-and-arms-ammunition-and-related-material" rel="external">Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order 2008</a>)</li>
  <li>any thing which falls within Chapter 93 of the Goods Classification Table<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, other than military goods</li>
  <li>provision of technical assistance, armed personnel, financial services or funds, or associated brokering services where such provision enables or facilitates the conduct of certain military activities</li>
  <li>dual-use goods and technology (as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2009/428/annex/I/division/LIST" rel="external">Annex I to Council Regulation 428/2009</a> as retained by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (‘the Dual-Use Regulation’))</li>
  <li>internal repression goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2 to the Regulations)</li>
  <li>interception and monitoring goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2A to the Regulations, but excluding goods and technology specified in Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order 2008, or Annex I to the Dual-Use Regulation)</li>
  <li>interception and monitoring services</li>
  <li>technical assistance relating to aircraft and ships</li>
  <li>tobacco industry goods (as specified in Schedule 2B to the Regulations)</li>

  <li>iron and steel products (as specified in Schedule 2B to the Regulations)</li>
  <li>critical industry goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2C of the Regulations)</li>
  <li>luxury goods (as specified in Schedule 2E or the Regulations)</li>
  <li>oil refining goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2F of the Regulations)</li>
  <li>quantum computing and advanced materials goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2G of the Regulations)</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interception-and-monitoring-prohibitions-in-sanctions-technical-guidance">Technical guidance on interception and monitoring is available</a>.</p>

<p>There are circumstances (set out in the relevant lists of controlled items) in which certain items are not controlled, for example when body armour or a helmet is accompanying a person for that person’s own protection. Please check the relevant lists as applicable.</p>

<p>Tobacco industry goods, potash, mineral products, iron and steel products, oil refining goods and luxury goods are identified by reference to commodity codes in the Goods Classification Table. The UK Tariff sets out a system for the classification of goods to enable importers to ascertain the applicable rate of import duty for their goods. It is this system of classification that is used in the Regulations in order to determine whether goods are within scope of the prohibitions.</p>

<p>This means that where commodity codes are used in the Regulations, the relevant goods are those which would be classified under the relevant commodity code (applying the rules in the UK Tariff) if the goods were being imported to the UK.</p>

<p>Some of the listings of commodity codes in the Regulations have an “ex” before the code. Where this “ex” appears before a commodity code this means that the prohibitions in the Regulations do not apply to all of the items under that commodity code. The prohibitions will only apply to those items that (1) would be classified under the commodity code and (2) that match the description given next to the relevant “ex” code entry in the Regulations.</p>

<p>Further detail on these trade prohibitions, including key terminology used, is explained below. Please have regard to the relevant legislation which contains full definitions of terms used herein.</p>

<h4>Export of goods</h4>

<p>The concept of ‘export’ is set out in customs legislation, but is further detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/schedule/1/paragraph/32" rel="external">Paragraph 32 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act</a>, which clarifies that “export” means export from the UK, but does not capture where goods are removed to the Isle of Man from the UK.</p>

<p>Export prohibitions in the Regulations cover export to Belarus as well as exports that are for use in Belarus. This means that, even if the immediate destination is not Belarus, the prohibition may still apply.</p>

<p>The export prohibitions at regulation 21 prohibit the export of military goods, dual-use goods, critical-industry goods, interception and monitoring goods, internal repression goods, luxury goods, oil refining goods, quantum computing and advanced material goods and tobacco industry goods to or for use in Belarus.</p>

<p>Exporters should check the ultimate end use of goods and may apply for a licence or contact the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) if they know or think the items may be used in Belarus.</p>

<p>A sanctions licence is not required for exports of non-military goods covered by the Regulations from Northern Ireland to an EU Member State where the final destination is Belarus. You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the onward export to Belarus. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK export control legislation as applicable.</p>

<h4>Import of goods</h4>

<p>The concept of ‘import’ is set out in customs legislation, but is further detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/schedule/1/paragraph/33" rel="external">Paragraph 33 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act</a>. This clarifies in particular that goods removed to the UK from the Isle of Man are not to be regarded as imported. Paragraph 34 details limited exceptions to this.</p>

<p>The import prohibition in regulation 27I (arms and related material, iron and steel products, mineral products and potash) covers goods that are consigned from Belarus and goods that originated in Belarus. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not Belarus, the prohibition may still apply. Therefore, importers should check the original place goods were consigned from or contact the DIT Import Controls team if they think the items may have originally been consigned from Belarus.</p>

<p>A sanctions licence is not required for imports into Northern Ireland of non-military goods covered by the Regulations from an EU Member State which originate in or are consigned from Belarus. You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the original import into the customs territory of the EU. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK import control legislation as applicable.</p>

<h4>Supply and delivery of goods</h4>

<p>Supply and delivery prohibitions in the Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering goods from a third country to a place in Belarus, from a place in Belarus to a third country, or from a place in a non-UK country to another non-UK country. Regulation 22(4) specifies that for the purposes of this regulation a third country is a country that is not the UK, Isle of Man or Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 22 prohibits a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering dual-use goods, critical-industry goods, interception and monitoring goods, internal repression goods, luxury goods, military goods, oil refining goods, quantum computing and advanced materials goods, and tobacco industry goods from a third country to a place in Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 27K prohibits a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering iron and steel products, military goods, potash or mineral products from a place in Belarus to a third country.</p>

<p>The Regulations also prohibit a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering potash or mineral products from a place in a non-UK country to a place in a different non-UK country, where the potash or mineral products originate in Belarus.</p>

<h4>Making goods and technology available</h4>

<p>Prohibitions in the Regulations on making restricted goods and technology available (e.g. through a sale) include directly or indirectly making them available for use in Belarus or to a person “connected with” Belarus. Regulation 2 sets out when a person is to be regarded as “connected with” Belarus (and this applies where the term is used in other trade prohibitions in this Part of the Regulations).</p>

<h4>Acquisition of goods and technology</h4>

<p>Regulation 27J prohibits a person from directly or indirectly acquiring potash, military goods or military technology from a person connected with Belarus.  It also prohibits a person from directly or indirectly acquiring iron and steel products, any thing which falls within Chapter 93 of the Goods Classification Table, military goods or military technology or mineral products which originate in or are located in Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 2(2) sets out when a person is to be regarded as “connected with” Belarus.</p>

<h4>Transfer of technology</h4>

<p>Prohibitions in the Regulations on the transfer of restricted technology include transfer to a place in Belarus or a person “connected with” Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 24 prohibits the transfer of dual-use technology, critical-industry technology, interception and monitoring technology, internal repression technology, military technology, oil refining technology and quantum  computing and advanced materials technology to a place in Belarus or to a person “connected with” Belarus.</p>

<p>The term ‘transfer’ is defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/schedule/1/paragraph/37" rel="external">Paragraph 37 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act</a>, which states that it ‘means a transfer by any means (or combination of means), including oral communication and that transfer of goods on which the technology is recorded or from which it can be derived, other than the export of such goods.’</p>

<p>Where restricted or dual-use technology is contained within a good, it would be classified as a restricted or dual-use good under the accompanying goods-related provisions. This includes information contained on USB memory devices, laptops, tablets and the like.</p>

<h4>Technical assistance</h4>

<p>The term ‘technical assistance’ in relation to goods or technology is defined in regulation 20, which states that it means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technical support relating to the repair, development, production, assembly, testing, use or maintenance of the goods or technology, or</li>
  <li>any other technical service relating to the goods or technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibitions apply where the technical assistance relates to certain specified goods or technology.</p>

<p>The prohibition in regulation 25 applies to the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance relating to relevant goods or technology (1) to persons connected with Belarus or (2) for use in Belarus.</p>

<p>This means that, even if the person to whom you are providing the relevant technical assistance is not in or “connected with” Belarus, the prohibition may still apply if the goods or technology to which the technical assistance relates are for use in Belarus. Therefore, if you are providing technical assistance you should check whether the goods or technology may be used in Belarus and apply for a licence or contact ECJU if so.</p>

<p>Regulation 25 prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance relating to dual-use goods and dual-use technology, critical industry goods and technology, interception and monitoring goods and technology, internal repression goods and technology, military goods and technology, oil refining goods and technology, quantum computing and advanced materials goods and technology to a person connected with Belarus or for use in Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 27L prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance in relation to prohibited trade in iron and steel products, mineral products and potash.</p>

<h4>Financial services and funds related to goods and technology</h4>

<p>‘Financial services’ refer to any services of a financial nature in many different forms including insurance and banking. Financial services include payment and money transmission services. The full definition of ‘financial services’ can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/61" rel="external">Section 61 of the Sanctions Act</a>.</p>

<p>‘Funds’ means financial assets and benefits of every kind, including cash, securities and interest. The full definition of ‘funds’ can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/60" rel="external">Section 60 of the Sanctions Act</a>.</p>

<p>Trade sanctions prohibitions on the provision of financial services and funds apply where they relate to certain specified goods or technology.</p>

<p>The prohibitions in the Regulations apply to the direct or indirect provision of financial services, and the direct or indirect making available of funds, to persons connected with Belarus in pursuance of or in connection with an arrangement set out in the Regulations.  These arrangements are set out in regulations 26 and 27M.  This captures arrangements where the object or effect falls into one of the prohibitions, for example the export or import of relevant goods, or the direct or indirect supply or delivery of relevant goods.</p>

<p>These prohibitions also prohibit the direct or indirect provision of financial services or funds in pursuance of or in connection with specific arrangements involving Belarus, as set out in regulations 26(3) and 27M(1).</p>

<h4>Brokering services</h4>

<p>The definition of ‘brokering services’ is set out in regulation 20, which states that it means any service to secure, or otherwise in relation to, an arrangement, including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the selection or introduction of persons as parties or potential parties to the arrangement</li>
  <li>the negotiation of the arrangement</li>
  <li>the facilitation of anything that enables the arrangement to be entered into, and</li>
  <li>the provision of any assistance that in any way promotes or facilitates the arrangement</li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibitions on the provision of brokering services apply where they relate to certain specified goods or technology.  The prohibitions apply to the direct or indirect provision of brokering services where they relate to specific arrangements. Those arrangements are set out in regulations 27 and, in relation to mineral products, potash and iron and steel, in regulation 27M.</p>

<h4>Other service provisions</h4>

<p>Certain other services are prohibited in the Regulations.</p>

<p>These include the provision of certain services which enable or facilitate certain military activities. As set out in regulation 27O, the direct or indirect provision of the following is prohibited where such provision enables or facilitates the conduct of military activities carried on or proposed to be carried on by the Belarusian military or any other military end-user who is a person connected with Belarus:</p>

<p>a) technical assistance</p>

<p>b) armed personnel</p>

<p>c) financial services or funds, or</p>

<p>d) brokering services in relation to an arrangement whose object or effect is to provide, in a non-UK country any of the services mentioned in paragraphs (a) - (c)</p>

<p>Prohibitions on interception and monitoring services are set out in regulation 24A and relate to the direct or indirect provision of such services to or for the benefit of the Government of Belarus. The Government of Belarus is defined in regulation 2(1) as including its public bodies, corporations or agencies or any person acting on its behalf or at its direction. The definition of ‘interception and monitoring services’ is set out in regulation 19A.</p>

<h4>Technical assistance relating to aircraft and ships</h4>

<p>Regulation 27N prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance to or for the benefit of persons designated for the purpose of this regulation, where that assistance relates to an aircraft or ship.</p>

<p>The persons designated for the purposes of this provision are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list">UK Sanctions List</a> under ‘sanctions imposed’.</p>

<p>The prohibition applies in relation to any aircraft or ship. You should carry out your own checks to determine to whom, or for whose benefit, you are providing technical assistance relating to aircraft or ships.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Immigration sanctions</h3>

<p>The effect of the Regulations is to impose a travel ban on persons who are designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of being made subject to immigration sanctions under the Sanctions Act. Such persons are excluded persons for the purposes of section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.</p>

<p>Designated individuals will be refused leave to enter or remain in the UK. Any applications they make for a visa to travel to the UK, including for transit purposes, will be refused. Any foreign national who is subject to a travel ban under the Regulations, and who is currently in the UK, will have their permission to stay in the UK cancelled and steps will be taken to remove them from the UK.</p>

<p>If you are the subject of an immigration sanction and try to travel to the UK, carriers are required to deny you boarding.</p>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-travel-bans">how the Home Office deals with those who are subject to a travel ban</a> can be found on the Home Office pages of GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Transport sanctions</h3>

<p>The Regulations impose transport prohibitions relating to aircraft and shipping.</p>

<h4>Aircraft sanctions</h4>

<p>Part 5A of the Regulations prohibit a Belarusian aircraft which is owned, chartered or operated by persons connected with Belarus or designated persons from overflying the United Kingdom or landing in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In addition, the Regulations provide a power for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to refuse to register an aircraft or for the Secretary of State to direct the CAA to terminate the registration of an aircraft that is owned or operated by a designated person or chartered by a designated person.</p>

<p>The Regulations confer direction making powers for the Secretary of State, air traffic control and airport operators regarding aircraft movements in United Kingdom airspace and at United Kingdom airports. The Regulations also provide a power for the Secretary of State to direct an airport operator to secure the detention of a Belarusian aircraft at an airport or to secure the movement of a Belarusian aircraft to a specified airport.</p>

<p>Belarusian aircraft is defined as an aircraft:</p>

<ul>
  <li>owned, chartered or operated by a designated person, or a person connected with Belarus, or</li>
  <li>registered in Belarus</li>
</ul>

<h4>Shipping sanctions</h4>

<p>Part 5B of the Regulations prohibit Belarusian ships, and other ships specified by the Secretary of State, from entering ports in the United Kingdom. The Regulations also confer powers on the Secretary of State and harbour authorities to issue port barring directions to the master or pilot of a specified ship. The Regulations provide the Secretary of State with a power to control the movement of Belarusian ships or specified ships by requiring them to leave or enter specified ports, proceed to a specified place or remain where they are.</p>

<p>The Regulations prohibit the registration of ships owned, controlled, chartered or operated by designated persons or persons connected with Belarus on the UK Ship Register and confer powers on the Secretary of State to direct the UK Ship Registrar to terminate the registration of such ships.</p>

<p>The Regulations also confer powers on the Secretary of State and harbour authorities to detain Belarusian ships or specified ships at ports or anchorages.</p>

<p>‘Belarusian ship’ is not a term used in the Regulations. However, it is used in this shipping section of the guidance to aid understanding and readability. It means a ship which is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person</li>
  <li>owned, controlled, chartered or operated by persons connected with Belarus</li>
  <li>registered in Belarus, or</li>
  <li>flying the flag of Belarus</li>
</ul>

<p>These Regulations do not apply to ships (that are not otherwise included in the Regulations) with Belarusian crews or Masters, unless they are a designated person.</p>

<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) is ultimately responsible for the implementation of these transport restrictions, some of which are enforced through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, harbour authorities, National Air Traffic Services Limited (NATS), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and airport operators.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Information and record keeping</h3>

<p>For the purpose of the financial sanctions contained in the Regulations, Part 7 of the Regulations places obligations on relevant firms (the definition of which is set out in the Regulations) to report information to HM Treasury about known or suspected designated persons or about persons who may have committed an offence under specified provisions of the Regulations.</p>

<p>It also grants powers to HM Treasury to request information from, amongst others, a designated person, including powers to request the production of documents. It also establishes offences for failing to comply with these requests (including for providing false information).</p>

<p>Part 7 also establishes information powers and record-keeping responsibilities in relation to the trade sanctions contained in the Regulations. It provides for offences for failing to comply with any of those requirements or intentionally obstructing an official in the exercise of those powers.</p>

<p>If you have obligations or responsibilities under Part 7 of the Regulations, it is important that you familiarise yourself with them. If you are unclear of your obligations or responsibilities, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How will these sanctions measures be enforced?</h2>

<p>The Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene the trade, aircraft, shipping and financial sanctions, as well as to enable or facilitate a contravention of, or to circumvent, any of the prohibitions in the Regulations. They also prescribe the mode of trial and penalties that apply to such offences.  In some cases, offences related to contraventions of prohibitions in the Regulations are contained within other legislation, such as the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (CEMA).</p>

<p>In addition to the below, further details on offences and penalties can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/600/pdfs/uksiod_20190600_en_001.pdf" rel="external">corresponding report</a> under section 18 of the Sanctions Act.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Financial sanctions</h3>

<p>Breaches of financial sanctions are a serious criminal offence. Any breach of the main financial prohibitions in the Regulations is an offence that is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>Offences under regulations 38(6) or 42 (information offences in connection with financial sanctions under the Regulations) are summary offences only and carry a maximum sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment or a fine (which in Scotland or Northern Ireland may not exceed level 5 on the standard scale) or both.</p>

<p>OFSI is responsible for monitoring compliance with financial sanctions and for assessing suspected breaches. It also has the power to impose monetary penalties for breaches of financial sanctions and to refer cases to law enforcement agencies for investigation and potential prosecution.</p>

<p>OFSI works with other parts of government, supervisory bodies and regulators to consider all cases reported to it, sharing relevant information accordingly.</p>

<p>If you find out that a person or organisation you are dealing with is subject to the financial sanctions detailed in the Regulations, you must immediately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stop dealing with them</li>
  <li>freeze any assets you are holding for them</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/financial-sanctions/get-help">inform OFSI</a> as soon as possible by either emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk">ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk</a> or by calling their general enquiries line: +44 (0)20 7270 5454</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information on OFSI’s approach to compliance and enforcement can be found in Chapter 7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs">OFSI’s guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Trade sanctions</h3>

<p>Any breach of the trade sanctions prohibitions in the Regulations is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both). Any breach of the trade licensing provisions is also triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 2 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is responsible for enforcing the licensing restrictions and investigating suspected offences.</p>

<p>If you discover that you have breached any of the trade prohibitions or licensing provisions, you should report the irregularity to HMRC (sometimes known as voluntary disclosure) as soon as possible. If the irregularity was found on an Export Control Joint Unit compliance audit, the compliance inspector will have informed HMRC and you are strongly advised to do the same. Guidance is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-controls-dual-use-items-software-and-technology-goods-for-torture-and-radioactive-sources#breaches-of-export-control-legislation">how to make a voluntary disclosure</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Transport sanctions</h3>

<p>In relation to the transport sanctions on movement of aircraft, the following are offences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the failure of an operator or pilot of a Belarusian aircraft to comply with the prohibition on overflying the United Kingdom or landing in the United Kingdom</li>
  <li>the failure of an airport operator, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a direction given by the Secretary of State</li>
  <li>the failure of an operator or pilot in command of a Belarusian aircraft to comply with a direction given by air traffic control or an airport operator</li>
</ul>

<p>All are offences that are triable either way and carry a maximum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>The Secretary of State may notify a person that the existence or content of a port barring, entry or movement direction and any direction relating to the movement of aircraft, or anything done under such directions, is to be treated as confidential. Disclosure of confidential information is an offence which carries a maximum sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment on summary conviction or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>A breach of the transport sanctions relating to prohibition on port entry, failing to comply with a port barring direction or a port entry or movement direction is an offence that is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>The offence of failing to comply with a detention direction in relation to a ship is triable either way and carries a sentence of a fine.</p>

<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) is ultimately responsible for the implementation of transport sanctions.  The enforcement of these sanctions will be supported by the the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, harbour authorities, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), National Air Traffic Services (NATS) and airport operators.</p>

<p>If you become aware that a breach of the transport prohibitions detailed in the Regulations has taken or will take place, then you must report it as soon as possible by calling DfT on 020 7944 5999 and by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:transportsanctions@dft.gov.uk">transportsanctions@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Are there circumstances when I can get an authorisation or licence for a sanctioned activity?</h2>

<p>Licensing and exception provisions are contained in Part 6 of the Regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Exceptions</h3>

<p>The Regulations set out exceptions to some of the sanctions prohibitions which apply within certain defined circumstances. An exception applies automatically, and does not require you to obtain a licence issued in accordance with the Regulations.</p>

<p>Regulation 30 establishes exceptions relating to financial sanctions prohibitions in regulations 11 to 15 including for the crediting of a frozen account by a relevant institution (any such interest or other earnings will be frozen in accordance with the relevant legislation underpinning the asset freeze). An exception also exists from the prohibition on making funds available to a designated person, when funds are transferred to a frozen account in discharge (or partial discharge) of an obligation which arose before the recipient became a designated person.</p>

<p>Regulation 31A establishes exceptions relating to loans and credit arrangements prohibited by regulation 15B.  A loan may be granted where it has a specific and documented objective of making emergency funds available to meet applicable solvency or liquidity criteria for a relevant subsidiary.</p>

<p>A category A loan (as defined above in section 1.2) may be granted where it consists of a drawdown or disbursement made under an arrangement entered into before 9 August 2021, provided that the terms and conditions set out in regulation 31A are met. A category B loan (as set out above in section 1.2) or a category C loan (as set out above in section 1.2) may also be granted if it consists of a drawdown or disbursement made under an arrangement entered into before 5 July 2022, provided it meets the terms and conditions specified in regulation 31A.</p>

<p>There are exceptions for the prohibitions in regulation 15C relating to the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to allow the provision of compulsory or third-party insurance to a Belarusian national or entity that is located in the UK. The provision of insurance for a diplomatic mission or consular post of Belarus in the UK is also exempt, as is the provision of insurance for those falling within paragraph 2(d) of regulation 15C if it is for their personal use.</p>

<p>The Regulations establish exceptions relating to trade sanctions.  They provide an exception to the prohibitions in regulation 27J(1) relating to the acquisition of mineral products, allowing the purchase in Belarus of mineral products where it is by an individual on a retail basis for their personal use, or solely for the performance of any humanitarian assistance activity in Belarus.  The import, supply or delivery of mineral products which have been purchased for either of those reasons is also permitted under the exception, as is the provision of related technical assistance, financial services or funds, or brokering services in relation to that purchase.</p>

<p>Regulation 31D providers for certain exceptions in relation to prohibitions relating to the export of goods, supply and delivery of goods, making goods and technology available for use in Belarus or available to a person connected with Belarus, transfer of technology, and the provision of related services. These are the restrictions set out in regulations 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27. This provides that prohibitions are not contravened:</p>

<p>in relation to critical-industry goods or technology, or quantum computing and advanced materials goods or technology which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the personal effects of a person travelling to Belarus</li>
  <li>of a non-commercial nature for the personal use of a person travelling to Belarus and contained in that person’s luggage, or</li>
  <li>necessary for the official purposes of a diplomatic mission, consular post or international organisation enjoying immunities</li>
</ul>

<p>in relation to luxury goods which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>necessary for the official purposes of a diplomatic mission or consular post in Belarus, or of an international organisation enjoying immunities, or</li>
  <li>the personal effects of their staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Certain prohibitions on critical-industry goods, critical-industry technology, or luxury goods are also excepted where these goods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consumer communication devices for civilian use, or</li>
  <li>software updates for civilian use (as defined in regulation 31E(1b))</li>
</ul>

<p>Regulation 31F allows for critical-industry goods, critical-industry technology, oil refining goods or oil refining technology as described in regulations 21-27 (with the exception of the provision of interception and monitoring services as defined in 24A) to be used to deal with an emergency, given permission from the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Regulations establish exceptions relating to some of the transport sanctions. There is an exception for the granting of access to a port where the access is needed by a ship in the case of an emergency or where a port entry or movement direction has been given in relation to the ship. Exceptions also apply in relation to the movement of aircraft in in the case of an emergency.</p>

<p>Regulation 31G provides an exception from the prohibition on the provision of technical assistance to or for the benefit of specific designated persons in relation to an aircraft or ship, where failure to provide that assistance would endanger the lives of persons on board the aircraft or ship or the safety of the aircraft in flight, or the ship at sea.</p>

<p>Regulation 30A establishes an exception to regulations 11 to 15, 15B, 15C or 15CA, and Chapters 2, 2A, 2B and 2C of Part 5 (Trade) which provides that prohibitions are not contravened if conduct is authorised by a licence which is issued under the law of the Isle of Man or any British Overseas Territory for the purpose of disapplying a prohibition in that jurisdiction which corresponds to the relevant prohibition.</p>

<p>Regulation 31 creates an exception in relation to any prohibition or requirement imposed by the Regulations for actions which a responsible officer has determined to be in the interests of national security, or the prevention or detection of serious crime in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether an exception applies in your circumstances, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Licensing for financial sanctions</h3>

<p>Where a person is designated for the purposes of the financial sanctions (asset freeze measures and making available provisions) contained in the Regulations, the designated person or a representative (on their behalf) may apply for a licence from OFSI to use their funds or economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles).  Schedule 3 to the Regulations sets out the purposes pursuant to which, or for which activities, OFSI may grant an individual licence. In summary these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic needs</li>
  <li>reasonable professional fees for or reasonable expenses associated with the provision of legal services</li>
  <li>reasonable fees or service charges arising from the routine holding or maintenance of frozen funds or economic resources</li>
  <li>extraordinary expenses</li>
  <li>pre-existing judicial decisions etc</li>
  <li>diplomatic missions and consular posts</li>
  <li>extraordinary situations</li>
  <li>prior obligations</li>
  <li>humanitarian assistance activities</li>
  <li>medical goods and services</li>
  <li>production or distribution of food</li>
</ul>

<p>The following licensing grounds apply to loans and credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>humanitarian assistance activity</li>
  <li>nuclear safety</li>
  <li>extraordinary situations</li>
  <li>diplomatic missions or consular posts</li>
  <li>medical goods or services</li>

  <li>nuclear safety</li>
  <li>extraordinary situations</li>
  <li>medical goods or services</li>
  <li>production or distribution of food</li>
</ul>

<p>A person or representative (on their behalf) may apply for a licence from OFSI to allow provision of financial services for the purposes of foreign exchange reserve and asset management services to the National Bank of Belarus or the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Belarus. Part 4 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations sets out the purposes pursuant to which, or for which activities, OFSI may grant an individual licence. In summary these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>humanitarian assistance activity</li>
  <li>financial regulation</li>
  <li>financial stability</li>
  <li>safety and soundness of a firm</li>
  <li>extraordinary situation</li>
</ul>

<p>Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licences-that-allow-activity-prohibited-by-financial-sanctions">licence applications and the relevant form</a> can be found on OFSI’s GOV.UK licensing webpage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Licensing for trade sanctions</h3>

<p>Licences may also be issued for certain trade activities that would otherwise be prohibited by the Regulations. The Department for International Trade (DIT) has overall responsibility for trade sanctions licensing. The Secretary of State for International Trade is ultimately responsible for decisions to grant or refuse a trade sanctions licence in any individual case.</p>

<p>The Export Control Joint Unit sits within DIT and is responsible for administering the licensing provisions on behalf of the Secretary of State for all trade sanctions, except those relating to imports which are administered by the DIT Import Licensing Branch. In exercising these powers, DIT seeks and considers advice from other government departments.</p>

<p>In making decisions on whether to grant a licence to permit something which would otherwise be prohibited under Part 5 of the Regulations, the Secretary of State will consider each application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether granting a licence would be consistent with the stated purposes of the sanctions regime and any UN or other relevant international law obligations.</p>

<p>For some prohibitions there are some specific activities which DIT considers are likely to be consistent with the aims of the sanctions. These are set out in the table below. If you think that your proposed activity falls within one of these specific descriptions you should make this clear and explain why you believe this to be the case in your application for a licence.</p>

<p>You should not assume that a licence will be granted or engage in any activities prohibited by trade sanctions until your licence has been granted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Overlap with strategic export licensing</h3>

<h4>Military goods and military technology</h4>

<p>Please note that the export of and trade in military goods and military technology are also controlled under the Export Control Order 2008 and so you may also need a licence which is valid under that legislation. This means that all licence applications relating to military goods and military technology will also need to be considered against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-12-08/hcws449" rel="external">Strategic Export Licensing Criteria</a>. A licence under the Regulations is unlikely to be granted if a licence is refused for the same activity under the Export Control Order 2008.</p>

<p>The way this will work in practice is that we will consider an application for a licence which relates to activities that are licensable under both the Regulations and the Export Control Order 2008 as an application for a licence under both pieces of legislation. This means that only a single licence application is required.</p>

<p>The application will be considered against the relevant licensing criteria. If a licence is granted it will be valid under both the Export Control Order 2008 and the Regulations.</p>

<h4>Dual-use goods and technology</h4>

<p>Please note that the export of and trade in dual-use goods and technology are also controlled under the Dual-Use Regulation. Authorisations under that Regulation are granted by the Secretary of State for International Trade under licensing powers in the Export Control Order 2008.</p>

<p>This means that all licence applications relating to items which are controlled dual-use goods and technology will also need to be considered against the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2021-12-08/hcws449" rel="external">Strategic Export Licensing Criteria</a>. A licence under the Regulations is unlikely to be granted if an authorisation is refused for the same activity under the Dual-Use Regulation.</p>

<p>As explained above in relation to military goods and technology, only a single licence application will be required in relation to dual-use goods and technology which falls within the scope of both the Regulations and the Dual-Use Regulation. If the application is compatible with both criteria, a licence will be granted which will be valid under the Dual-Use Regulation and the Export Control Order 2008 as well as the Regulations.</p>

<h4>Overlap between trade sanctions and financial sanctions</h4>

<p>If you import or export goods, you need to consider if financial sanctions apply to you.  You may need a licence from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-financial-sanctions-implementation">OFSI</a> as well as from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/export-control-organisation">Export Control Joint Unit</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ilb.trade.gov.uk/icms/fox/live/IMP_LOGIN/login" rel="external">Import Licensing Branch</a>.</p>

<h4>Transit control</h4>

<p>Certain goods transiting the UK are still regarded as being exported when they leave the country and are therefore subject to control. Article 17 of the Export Control Order 2008 includes a transit and transhipment exception meaning that in many situations a licence is not required. This exception does not apply to goods destined for Belarus, meaning that a licence is required to transit goods through the UK or to tranship them in the UK with a view to re-exportation to Belarus.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Licensing for transport sanctions</h3>

<p>Licences may also be issued for certain transport activities that would otherwise be prohibited by the Regulations. The Department for Transport (DfT) has overall responsibility for transport sanctions licensing. The Secretary of State for Transport is ultimately responsible for decisions to grant or refuse a transport sanctions licence in any individual case.</p>

<p>For some prohibitions there are some specific activities that DfT considers are likely to be consistent with the aims of the sanctions.</p>

<p>These are set out in the table below. If you think that your proposed activity falls within one of these specific descriptions you should make this clear and explain why you believe this to be the case in your application for a licence.</p>
