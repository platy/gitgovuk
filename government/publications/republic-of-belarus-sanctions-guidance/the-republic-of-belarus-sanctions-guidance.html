<p>As required by section 43 of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (‘the Sanctions Act’), the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs has provided this guidance to assist in the implementation of, and compliance with, <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/600/introduction/made">the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019</a> (the ‘Regulations’), as amended from time to time.</p>

<p>The following instruments have made amendments to this instrument. If a consolidated version is not yet available on legislation.gov.uk, these instruments should be read alongside the original instrument:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/590/contents" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Sanctions (EU Exit) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No.2) Regulations 2020</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>As required by the Sanctions Act, this document contains guidance on the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations. It additionally provides guidance on best practice for complying with the prohibitions and requirements; the enforcement of them; and circumstances where they do not apply.</p>

<p>This document is intended to be read alongside more detailed sanctions guidance published by departments including the Department for International Trade (DIT), Department for Transport, Home Office and HM Treasury, through the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). This document contains links to those key sources of sanctions guidance, which will be regularly maintained and updated on GOV.UK. It is designed to give an overview of the prohibitions and requirements in the Regulations and, where appropriate, direct readers to further detailed guidance. This document is current on the date of publication.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019</h2>

<p>The Regulations impose financial, trade, aircraft and immigration sanctions for the purposes of encouraging the Government of Belarus to respect democratic principles and institutions, the separation of powers and the rule of law in Belarus; and refrain from actions, policies or activities which repress civil society in Belarus. The sanctions also encourage the Government to investigate properly and institute criminal proceedings against persons responsible for the disappearances of Yury Zakharanka, Viktar Hanchar, Anatol Krasouski and Dzmitry Zavadski, and to comply with international human rights law and respect human rights.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the stated purposes, the Regulations impose a number of prohibitions and requirements. In order to enforce these, the Regulations establish penalties and offences, which are set out in detail in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/600/pdfs/uksiod_20190600_en_001.pdf">corresponding report</a> under section 18 of the Sanctions Act in relation to criminal offences.</p>

<p>The prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations apply within the territory of the United Kingdom (UK) (including Northern Ireland) and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world. UK persons include British nationals, as well as all bodies incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the UK. Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas.</p>

<p>The maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 9 of the Regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters.</p>

<p>It is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent the prohibitions imposed by the Regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions.</p>

<p>If you are unclear about any aspect of the Regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the Regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.</p>

<p>Prohibitions and requirements for the financial, trade, aircraft and immigration sanctions contained in the Regulations are set out below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Designation of persons</h3>

<p>The Regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons for the purposes of financial and/or immigration sanctions and/or certain trade sanctions if they are an involved person (as defined in regulation 6).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list" class="govuk-link">UK Sanctions List</a> lists the people designated under the Regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Financial sanctions</h3>

<h4>Asset freeze and making available provisions</h4>

<p>The Regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>More <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs">information on financial sanctions</a> can be found in the OFSI guidance.</p>

<p>OFSI is the authority responsible for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury.  OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-financial-sanctions-implementation">how OFSI implements financial sanctions</a> can be found on the OFSI pages of GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Other financial and investment restrictions</h4>

<p>The Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly dealing with a transferable security or money-market instrument if it has a maturity exceeding 90 days, and was issued after noon on 9 August 2021 by a “relevant person” (as defined in regulation 15D(1)).  A relevant person is defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Belarus</li>
  <li>a Belarusian authority (as defined in regulation 15D(1))</li>
  <li>an entity wholly owned by Belarus or a Belarusian authority (‘wholly owned’ is defined in regulation 15D(4))</li>
  <li>a credit or financial institution majority owned by Belarus or a Belarusian authority (‘majority owned’ is defined in regulation 15D(3))</li>
  <li>an entity incorporated or constituted under the law of a country other than the UK and majority owned by said credit or financial institutions</li>
  <li>anyone acting on behalf or at the direction of said credit or financial institutions or the entities incorporated or constituted under the law of a country other than the UK and majority owned by said credit or financial institutions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Loan and credit arrangements</h4>

<p>The Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly granting a loan or credit, or entering into any arrangement to directly or indirectly grant a loan or credit, with a maturity exceeding 90 days, after noon on 9 August 2021 to a “relevant person” (as set out above).</p>

<h4>Insurance and reinsurance services</h4>

<p>A person must not provide insurance or reinsurance services to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Belarus</li>
  <li>a Belarusian authority (as defined in regulation 15D(1))</li>
  <li>an entity wholly owned by Belarus or a Belarusian authority</li>
  <li>anyone acting on their behalf or at their direction</li>
</ul>

<p>This prohibition does not apply to persons who are in charge of a ship or aircraft and who are temporarily acting at the direction of the Belarusian authorities etc, for certain specified purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Trade sanctions</h3>

<p>The Regulations impose trade prohibitions relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>military goods and military technology (as specified in <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/3231/schedule/2/crossheading/military-security-and-paramilitary-goods-software-and-technology-and-arms-ammunition-and-related-material" class="govuk-link">Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order 2008</a>)</li>
  <li>dual-use goods and technology (as specified in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32009R0428#d1e32-12-1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Annex I to Council Regulation 428/2009</a> as retained by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (‘the Dual-Use Regulation’))</li>
  <li>internal repression goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2 to the Regulations)</li>
  <li>interception and monitoring goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2A to the Regulations, but excluding goods and technology specified in Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order 2008, or Annex I to the Dual-Use Regulation)</li>
  <li>interception and monitoring services</li>
  <li>technical assistance relating to aircraft</li>
  <li>tobacco industry goods (as specified in Schedule 2B to the Regulations)</li>
  <li>potash (as specified in Schedule 2B to the Regulations)</li>
  <li>petroleum products (as specified in Schedule 2B to the Regulations)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/interception-and-monitoring-prohibitions-in-sanctions-technical-guidance" class="govuk-link">Technical guidance on interception and monitoring is available</a>.</p>

<p>There are circumstances (set out in the relevant lists of controlled items) in which certain items are not controlled, for example when body armour or a helmet is accompanying a person for that person’s own protection. Please check the relevant lists as applicable.</p>

<p>A number of goods subject to prohibitions in the Regulations are identified by reference to commodity codes in the Goods Classification Table<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. The UK Tariff sets out a system for the classification of goods to enable importers to ascertain the applicable rate of import duty for their goods. It is this system of classification that is used in the Regulations in order to determine whether goods are within scope of the prohibitions.</p>

<p>This means that where commodity codes are used in the Regulations, the relevant goods are those which would be classified under the relevant commodity code (applying the rules in the UK Tariff) if the goods were being imported to the UK.</p>

<p>Some of the listings of commodity codes in the Regulations have an “ex” before the code. Where this “ex” appears before a commodity code this means that the prohibitions in the Regulations do not apply to all of the items under that commodity code. The prohibitions will only apply to those items that (1) would be classified under the commodity code and (2) that match the description given next to the relevant “ex” code entry in the Regulations.</p>

<p>Further detail on these trade prohibitions, including key terminology used, is explained below. Please have regard to the relevant legislation which contains full definitions of terms used herein.</p>

<h4>Export of goods</h4>

<p>The concept of ‘export’ is set out in customs legislation, but is further detailed in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/schedule/1/paragraph/32" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Paragraph 32 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act</a>, which clarifies that “export” means export from the UK, but does not capture where goods are removed to the Isle of Man from the UK.</p>

<p>Export prohibitions in the Regulations cover export to Belarus as well as exports that are for use in Belarus. This means that, even if the immediate destination is not Belarus, the prohibition may still apply.  The export prohibitions at regulation 27B prohibit the export of dual-use goods for military use in Belarus, and the export to Belarus of dual-use goods for military use.</p>

<p>Exporters should check the ultimate end use of goods and may apply for a licence or contact the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) if they know or think the items may be used in Belarus.</p>

<p>A sanctions licence is not required for exports of non-military goods covered by the Regulations from Northern Ireland to an EU Member State where the final destination is Belarus. You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the onward export to Belarus. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK export control legislation as applicable.</p>

<h4>Import of goods</h4>

<p>The concept of ‘import’ is set out in customs legislation, but is further detailed in <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/schedule/1/paragraph/33">Paragraph 33 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act</a>. This clarifies in particular that goods removed to the UK from the Isle of Man are not to be regarded as imported. Paragraph 34 details limited exceptions to this.</p>

<p>The import prohibition in regulation 27I (potash and petroleum products) covers imports that are consigned from Belarus and originated in Belarus. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not Belarus, the prohibition may still apply. Therefore, importers should check the original place goods were consigned from or contact the DIT Import Controls team if they think the items may have originally been consigned from Belarus.</p>

<p>A sanctions licence is not required for imports of non-military goods covered by the Regulations from an EU Member State which originate in or are consigned from Belarus. You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the original import into the customs territory of the EU. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK import control legislation as applicable.</p>

<h4>Supply and delivery of goods</h4>

<p>Supply and delivery prohibitions in the Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering goods from a third country to a place in Belarus. Regulation 22(4) specifies that for the purposes of this regulation a third country is a country that is not the UK, Isle of Man or Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 27C prohibits a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering dual-use goods for military use from a third country to a place in Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 27K prohibits a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering potash or petroleum products from a place in Belarus to a third country.  Regulation 27K specifies that a third country is a country that is not the UK, Isle of Man or Belarus.</p>

<p>The Regulations also prohibit a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering potash or petroleum products from a place in a non-UK country to a place in a different non-UK country, where the potash or petroleum products originate in Belarus.</p>

<h4>Making goods and technology available</h4>

<p>Prohibitions in the Regulations on making restricted goods and technology available (e.g. through a sale) include directly or indirectly making them available for use in Belarus or to a person “connected with” Belarus. Regulation 2 sets out when a person is to be regarded as “connected with” Belarus (and this applies where the term is used in other trade prohibitions in this Part of the Regulations).</p>

<h4>Acquisition of goods</h4>

<p>Regulation 27J prohibits a person from directly or indirectly acquiring potash which originates in Belarus, is located in Belarus, or from a person connected with Belarus.  It also prohibits a person from directly or indirectly acquiring petroleum products which originate in or are located in Belarus.</p>

<h4>Transfer of technology</h4>

<p>Prohibitions in the Regulations on the transfer of restricted technology include transfer to a place in Belarus or a person “connected with” Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 27E prohibits the transfer of dual-use technology for military use to a place in Belarus, and the transfer of dual-use technology for military use to a person “connected with” Belarus.</p>

<p>The term ‘transfer’ is defined in <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/schedule/1/paragraph/37">Paragraph 37 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act</a>, which states that it ‘means a transfer by any means (or combination of means), including oral communication and that transfer of goods on which the technology is recorded or from which it can be derived, other than the export of such goods.’</p>

<p>Where restricted or dual-use technology is contained within a good, it would be classified as a restricted or dual-use good under the accompanying goods-related provisions. This includes information contained on USB memory devices, laptops, tablets and the like.</p>

<h4>Technical assistance</h4>

<p>The term ‘technical assistance’ in relation to goods or technology is defined in regulation 20, which states that it means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technical support relating to the repair, development, production, assembly, testing, use or maintenance of the goods or technology, or</li>
  <li>any other technical service relating to the goods or technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibitions apply where the technical assistance relates to certain specified goods or technology.</p>

<p>The prohibition in regulation 25 applies to the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance relating to restricted goods or technology (1) to persons connected with Belarus or (2) for use in Belarus.</p>

<p>This means that, even if the person to whom you are providing the relevant technical assistance is not in or “connected with” Belarus, the prohibition may still apply if the goods or technology to which the technical assistance relates are for use in Belarus. Therefore, if you are providing technical assistance you should check whether the goods or technology may be used in Belarus and apply for a licence or contact ECJU if so.</p>

<p>Regulation 27F prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance relating to dual-use goods for military use or dual-use technology for military use to a person connected with Belarus or for military use in Belarus.</p>

<p>Regulation 27L prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance in relation to prohibited trade in petroleum products.</p>

<h4>Financial services and funds related to goods and technology</h4>

<p>‘Financial services’ refer to any services of a financial nature in many different forms including insurance and banking. Financial services include payment and money transmission services. The full definition of ‘financial services’ can be found in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/61" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Section 61 of the Sanctions Act</a>.</p>

<p>‘Funds’ means financial assets and benefits of every kind, including cash, securities and interest. The full definition of ‘funds’ can be found in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/13/section/60">Section 60 of the Sanctions Act</a>.</p>

<p>Trade sanctions prohibitions on the provision of financial services and funds apply where they relate to certain specified goods or technology.</p>

<p>The prohibitions in the Regulations apply to the direct or indirect provision of financial services, and the direct or indirect making available of funds, to persons connected with Belarus in pursuance of or in connection with an arrangement set out in the Regulations.  These arrangements are set out in regulations 26, 27G and 27M.  This captures arrangements where the object or effect falls into one of the prohibitions, for example the export of restricted goods, or the direct or indirect supply or delivery of restricted goods.</p>

<p>These prohibitions also prohibit the direct or indirect provision of financial services or funds in pursuance of or in connection with specific arrangements, as set out in regulations 26(3), 27G(3) and 27M(1).</p>

<h4>Brokering services</h4>

<p>The definition of ‘brokering services’ is set out in regulation 20, which states that it means any service to secure, or otherwise in relation to, an arrangement, including (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the selection or introduction of persons as parties or potential parties to the arrangement</li>
  <li>the negotiation of the arrangement</li>
  <li>the facilitation of anything that enables the arrangement to be entered into, and</li>
  <li>the provision of any assistance that in any way promotes or facilitates the arrangement</li>
</ul>

<p>Prohibitions on the provision of brokering services apply where they relate to certain specified goods or technology.  The prohibitions apply to the direct or indirect provision of brokering services where they relate to specific arrangements. Those arrangements are set out in regulations 27, 27H and, in relation to petroleum products, regulation 27M.</p>

<h4>Other service provisions</h4>

<p>Certain other services are prohibited in the Regulations.</p>

<p>Prohibitions on interception and monitoring services are set out in regulation 24A and relate to the direct or indirect provision of such services to or for the benefit of the Government of Belarus. The Government of Belarus is defined in regulation 2(1) as including its public bodies, corporations or agencies or any person acting on its behalf or at its direction. The definition of ‘interception and monitoring services’ is set out in regulation 19A.</p>

<h4>Technical assistance relating to aircraft</h4>

<p>Regulation 27N prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance to or for the benefit of persons designated for the purpose of this regulation, where that assistance relates to an aircraft.</p>

<p>The persons designated for the purposes of this provision are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list" class="govuk-link">UK Sanctions List</a> under ‘sanctions imposed’.</p>

<p>The prohibition applies in relation to any aircraft. You should carry out your own checks to determine to whom, or for whose benefit, you are providing technical assistance relating to aircraft.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Immigration sanctions</h3>

<p>The effect of the Regulations is to impose a travel ban on persons who are designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of being made subject to immigration sanctions under the Sanctions Act. Such persons are excluded persons for the purposes of section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.</p>

<p>Designated individuals will be refused leave to enter or remain in the UK. Any applications they make for a visa to travel to the UK, including for transit purposes, will be refused. Any foreign national who is subject to a travel ban under the Regulations, and who is currently in the UK, will have their permission to stay in the UK cancelled and steps will be taken to remove them from the UK.</p>

<p>If you are the subject of an immigration sanction and try to travel to the UK, carriers are required to deny you boarding.</p>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-travel-bans">how the Home Office deals with those who are subject to a travel ban</a> can be found on the Home Office pages of GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Transport sanctions</h3>

<p>Part 5A of the Regulations confers powers on the Secretary of State, air traffic control and airport operators to make certain directions with the object of preventing Belarusian aircraft from flying over or landing in the UK.  It also grants a power to the CAA to refuse certain permissions under the Air Navigation Order 2016, or to suspend or revoke permissions already granted, in respect of Belarusian aircraft.</p>

<p>A Belarusian aircraft is defined in regulation 29E as an aircraft owned, chartered or operated by a person connected with Belarus, or registered in Belarus.</p>

<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) is responsible for the implementation of this prohibition, with the support of the CAA, NATS, and airport operators.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Information and record keeping</h3>

<p>For the purpose of the financial sanctions contained in the Regulations, Part 7 of the Regulations places obligations on relevant firms (the definition of which is set out in the Regulations) to report information to HM Treasury about known or suspected designated persons or about persons who may have committed an offence under specified provisions of the Regulations.</p>

<p>It also grants powers to HM Treasury to request information from, amongst others, a designated person, including powers to request the production of documents. It also establishes offences for failing to comply with these requests (including for providing false information).</p>

<p>Part 7 also establishes information powers and record-keeping responsibilities in relation to the trade sanctions contained in the Regulations. It provides for offences for failing to comply with any of those requirements or intentionally obstructing an official in the exercise of those powers.</p>

<p>If you have obligations or responsibilities under Part 7 of the Regulations, it is important that you familiarise yourself with them. If you are unclear of your obligations or responsibilities, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How will these sanctions measures be enforced?</h2>

<p>The Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene the trade, aircraft and financial sanctions, as well as to enable or facilitate a contravention of, or to circumvent, any of the prohibitions in the Regulations. They also prescribe the mode of trial and penalties that apply to such offences.  In some cases, offences related to contraventions of prohibitions in the Regulations are contained within other legislation, such as the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (CEMA).</p>

<p>In addition to the below, further details on offences and penalties can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/600/pdfs/uksiod_20190600_en_001.pdf">corresponding report</a> under section 18 of the Sanctions Act.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Financial sanctions</h3>

<p>Breaches of financial sanctions are a serious criminal offence. Any breach of the main financial prohibitions in the Regulations is an offence that is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>Offences under regulations 38(6) or 42 (information offences in connection with financial sanctions under the Regulations) are summary offences only and carry a maximum sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment or a fine (which in Scotland or Northern Ireland may not exceed level 5 on the standard scale) or both.</p>

<p>OFSI is responsible for monitoring compliance with financial sanctions and for assessing suspected breaches. It also has the power to impose monetary penalties for breaches of financial sanctions and to refer cases to law enforcement agencies for investigation and potential prosecution.</p>

<p>OFSI works with other parts of government, supervisory bodies and regulators to consider all cases reported to it, sharing relevant information accordingly.</p>

<p>If you find out that a person or organisation you are dealing with is subject to the financial sanctions detailed in the Regulations, you must immediately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stop dealing with them</li>
  <li>freeze any assets you are holding for them</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/financial-sanctions/get-help">inform OFSI</a> as soon as possible by either emailing <a href="mailto:ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk</a> or by calling their general enquiries line: +44 (0)20 7270 5454</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information on OFSI’s approach to compliance and enforcement can be found in Chapter 7 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs" class="govuk-link">OFSI’s guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Trade sanctions</h3>

<p>Any breach of the trade sanctions prohibitions in the Regulations is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both). Any breach of the trade licensing provisions is also triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 2 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).</p>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is responsible for enforcing the licensing restrictions and investigating suspected offences.</p>

<p>If you discover that you have breached any of the trade prohibitions or licensing provisions, you should report the irregularity to HMRC (sometimes known as voluntary disclosure) as soon as possible. If the irregularity was found on an Export Control Joint Unit compliance audit, the compliance inspector will have informed HMRC and you are strongly advised to do the same. Guidance is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-controls-dual-use-items-software-and-technology-goods-for-torture-and-radioactive-sources#breaches-of-export-control-legislation" class="govuk-link">how to make a voluntary disclosure</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Transport sanctions</h3>

<p>A failure by the operator or pilot of an aircraft to comply with a direction under regulation 29A from an airport operator or from air traffic control, is an offence that is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).  Airport operators may also commit an offence if they fail to comply with a direction from the Secretary of State without reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) is responsible for the implementation of transport sanctions.  The enforcement of these sanctions will be supported by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), National Air Traffic Services (NATS) and airport operators.</p>

<p>If you become aware that a breach of the aviation prohibition detailed in the Regulations has taken or will take place, then you must report it as soon as possible by calling DfT on 020 7944 5999 and by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:transportsanctions@dft.gov.uk">transportsanctions@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Are there circumstances when I can get an authorisation or licence for a sanctioned activity?</h2>

<p>Licensing and exception provisions are contained in Part 6 of the Regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Exceptions</h3>

<p>The Regulations set out exceptions to some of the sanctions prohibitions which apply within certain defined circumstances. An exception applies automatically, and does not require you to obtain a licence issued in accordance with the Regulations.</p>

<p>Regulation 30 establishes exceptions relating to financial sanctions prohibitions in regulations 11 to 15 including for the crediting of a frozen account by a relevant institution (any such interest or other earnings will be frozen in accordance with the relevant legislation underpinning the asset freeze). An exception also exists from the prohibition on making funds available to a designated person, when funds are transferred to a frozen account in discharge (or partial discharge) of an obligation which arose before the recipient became a designated person. There is also an exception in relation to the purchase of petroleum products in Belarus by an individual on a retail basis for personal use, or solely for the purposes of the performance of any humanitarian assistance activity in Belarus, should this engage the provisions in regulations 11 to 15.  The provision of financial services or making available of funds in relation to that purchase is also permitted under the exception.</p>

<p>Regulation 30A establishes an exception to regulations 11 to 15, 15B, 15C, and Chapter 2, 2A, 2B and 2C of  Part 5 (Trade) which provides that prohibitions are not contravened if conduct is authorised by a licence which is issued under the law of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man or any British Overseas Territory for the purpose of disapplying a prohibition in that jurisdiction which corresponds to the relevant prohibition.</p>

<p>Regulation 31 creates an exception in relation to any prohibition or requirement imposed by the Regulations for actions which a responsible officer has determined to be in the interests of national security, or the prevention or detection of serious crime in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Regulation 31A establishes exceptions relating to loans and credit arrangements prohibited by regulation 15B.  A loan may be granted where it has a specific and documented objective of making funds available for trade which is not prohibited by the Regulations.  A loan may also be granted where it consists of a drawdown or disbursement made under an arrangement entered into before 9 August 2021, provided that the terms and conditions of that drawdown or disbursement were agreed before 9 August 2021 and have not been modified since, and that a date has been fixed for the repayment of the loan and the cancellation of the arrangement.</p>

<p>There are exceptions for the prohibitions in regulation 15C relating to the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to allow the provision of compulsory or third-party insurance to a Belarusian national or entity that is located in the UK. The provision of insurance for a diplomatic mission or consular post of Belarus in the UK is also exempt, as is the provision of insurance for those falling within paragraph 2(d) of regulation 15C if it is for their personal use.</p>

<p>The Regulations establish exceptions relating to trade sanctions.  They provide an exception to the prohibitions in regulation 27J(1) relating to the acquisition of petroleum products, allowing the purchase in Belarus of petroleum products where it is by an individual on a retail basis for their personal use, or solely for the performance of any humanitarian assistance activity in Belarus.  The import, supply or delivery of petroleum products which have been purchased for either of those reasons is also permitted under the exception, as is the provision of related technical assistance, financial services or funds, or brokering services in relation to that purchase.</p>

<p>There is an exception from the prohibition on the provision of technical assistance to or for the benefit of specific designated persons in relation to an aircraft, where failure to provide that assistance would endanger the lives of persons on board the aircraft or the safety of the aircraft in flight.</p>

<p>Exceptions may be made in the directions made by the Secretary of State under regulation 29A. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-sanctions">Full details are available online</a>.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether an exception applies in your circumstances, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Licensing for financial sanctions</h3>

<p>Where a person is designated for the purposes of the financial sanctions (asset freeze measures and making available provisions) contained in the Regulations, the designated person or a representative (on their behalf) may apply for a licence from OFSI to use their funds or economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles).  Schedule 3 to the Regulations sets out the purposes pursuant to which, or for which activities, OFSI may grant an individual licence. In summary these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic needs</li>
  <li>reasonable professional fees for or reasonable expenses associated with the provision of legal services</li>
  <li>reasonable fees or service charges arising from the routine holding or maintenance of frozen funds or economic resources</li>
  <li>extraordinary expenses</li>
  <li>pre-existing judicial decisions etc</li>
  <li>diplomatic missions</li>
  <li>extraordinary situations</li>
  <li>prior obligations</li>
  <li>humanitarian assistance activities</li>
</ul>

<p>The following licensing grounds apply to loans and credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to enable anything to be done in connection with the performance of any humanitarian assistance activity</li>
  <li>to enable anything to be done for the purposes of nuclear safety</li>
  <li>to enable anything to be done to deal with an extraordinary situation</li>
  <li>to enable anything to be done in order that the functions of a diplomatic mission or consular post of Belarus in the United Kingdom may be carried out</li>
</ul>

<p>The following licensing grounds apply to insurance and re-insurance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to enable anything to be done in connection with the performance of any humanitarian assistance activity</li>
  <li>to enable anything to be done for the purposes of nuclear safety</li>
  <li>to enable anything to be done to deal with an extraordinary situation</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Licensing for trade sanctions</h3>

<p>Licences may also be issued for certain trade activities that would otherwise be prohibited by the Regulations. The Department for International Trade (DIT) has overall responsibility for trade sanctions licensing. The Secretary of State for International Trade is ultimately responsible for decisions to grant or refuse a trade sanctions licence in any individual case.</p>

<p>The Export Control Joint Unit sits within DIT and is responsible for administering the licensing provisions on behalf of the Secretary of State for all trade sanctions, except those relating to imports which are administered by the DIT Import Licensing Branch. In exercising these powers, DIT seeks and considers advice from other government departments.</p>

<p>In making decisions on whether to grant a licence to permit something which would otherwise be prohibited under Part 5 of the Regulations, the Secretary of State will consider each application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether granting a licence would be consistent with the stated purposes of the sanctions regime and any UN or other relevant international law obligations.</p>

<p>For some prohibitions there are some specific activities which DIT considers are likely to be consistent with the aims of the sanctions. These are set out in the table below. If you think that your proposed activity falls within one of these specific descriptions you should make this clear and explain why you believe this to be the case in your application for a licence.</p>

<p>You should not assume that a licence will be granted or engage in any activities prohibited by trade sanctions until your licence has been granted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Overlap with strategic export licensing</h3>

<h4>Military goods and military technology</h4>

<p>Please note that the export of and trade in military goods and military technology are also controlled under the Export Control Order 2008 and so you may also need a licence which is valid under that legislation. This means that all licence applications relating to military goods and military technology will also need to be considered against the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018">strategic export licensing criteria</a>. A licence under the Regulations is unlikely to be granted if a licence is refused for the same activity under the Export Control Order 2008.</p>

<p>The way this will work in practice is that we will consider an application for a licence which relates to activities that are licensable under both the Regulations and the Export Control Order 2008 as an application for a licence under both pieces of legislation. This means that only a single licence application is required.</p>

<p>The application will be considered against the relevant licensing criteria. If a licence is granted it will be valid under both the Export Control Order 2008 and the Regulations.</p>

<h4>Dual-use goods and technology</h4>

<p>Please note that the export of and trade in dual-use goods and technology are also controlled under the Dual-Use Regulation. Authorisations under that Regulation are granted by the Secretary of State for International Trade under licensing powers in the Export Control Order 2008.</p>

<p>This means that all licence applications relating to items which are controlled dual-use goods and technology will also need to be considered against the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018">strategic export licensing criteria</a>. A licence under the Regulations is unlikely to be granted if an authorisation is refused for the same activity under the Dual-Use Regulation.</p>

<p>As explained above in relation to military goods and technology, only a single licence application will be required in relation to dual-use goods and technology which falls within the scope of both the Regulations and the Dual-Use Regulation. If the application is compatible with both criteria, a licence will be granted which will be valid under the Dual-Use Regulation and the Export Control Order 2008 as well as the Regulations.</p>

<h4>Overlap between trade sanctions and financial sanctions</h4>

<p>If you import or export goods, you need to consider if financial sanctions apply to you.  You may need a licence from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-financial-sanctions-implementation">OFSI</a> as well as from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/export-control-organisation" class="govuk-link">Export Control Joint Unit</a> or the <a href="https://www.ilb.trade.gov.uk/icms/fox/live/IMP_LOGIN/login" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Import Licensing Branch</a>.</p>

<h4>Transit control</h4>

<p>Certain goods transiting the UK are still regarded as being exported when they leave the country and are therefore subject to control. Article 17 of the Export Control Order 2008 includes a transit and transhipment exception meaning that in many situations a licence is not required. This exception does not apply to goods destined for Belarus, meaning that a licence is required to transit goods through the UK or to tranship them in the UK with a view to re-exportation to Belarus.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Directions in respect of immigration sanctions</h3>

<p>If you are subject to immigration sanctions the Home Office may direct on a case by case basis, that the sanction does not apply in particular circumstances, such as for travel to, or through, the UK for a UN sponsored meeting. You can check how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/what-you-need-to-do" class="govuk-link">apply for a UK visa</a>, and find further information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration/arriving-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">travelling to the UK</a> on GOV.UK.</p>
