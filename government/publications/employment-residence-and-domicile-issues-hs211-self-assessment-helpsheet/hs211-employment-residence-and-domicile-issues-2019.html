<p>This helpsheet should usually be completed only if you’re taxable under the remittance basis rules. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc notes</a>. The boxes on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-additional-information-sa101">Additional information</a> pages allow you to calculate total earnings received from each employment during the year ended 5 April 2019. Complete them as appropriate, following the guidance notes. However, in consequence of your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residence status - read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc pages</a>
</li>
  <li>the place where the duties of your employment were performed  - read <a class="govuk-link" href="#note1">note 1</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may not be liable to UK Income Tax on the whole amount received in the year ended 5 April 2019.</p>

<p>This helpsheet allows you to calculate the amounts received from each employment in the year ended 5 April 2019 which are not liable to UK Income Tax in that year and which you must enter in box 12 in the ‘Share schemes and employment lump sums’ section on page Ai 2 of your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-additional-information-sa101">Additional information</a> pages.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>If your employer has obtained a direction regarding the proportion of your earnings on which PAYE was to be operated, you should make sure that all of the cash earnings from the employment have been included in box 1 of your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> page, and not only those on which PAYE has been operated, as shown on your P60.</p>

<p>Throughout this helpsheet the phrases ‘earlier year’ and ‘later year’ will be used as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>earlier year is a tax year which ends before 6 April 2018</li>
  <li>later year is a tax year starting after 5 April 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>If in an earlier year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you were paid earnings overseas which were not liable to UK Income Tax unless they were remitted to the UK -
 read <a class="govuk-link" href="#note2">note 2</a>
</li>
  <li>you’ve remitted some or all of those sums to the UK during the year ended 5 April 2018</li>
  <li>those sums do not yet appear on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> page enter the amount remitted in box 1 in pounds</li>

<p>If you are not domiciled in the UK and you receive earnings from a foreign employer, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#note3">note 3</a> and you wish to claim a deduction for ‘corresponding payments’, read <a class="govuk-link" href="#note4">note 4</a> for guidance on corresponding payments, enter the amount of the deduction in box 2 in pounds below. Do not include in box 2 loan interest or contributions that you pay to an overseas pension scheme that’s not UK registered. You should enter loan interest in box 5 of the ‘Other tax reliefs’ section on page Ai 2 of your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-additional-information-sa101">Additional information</a> pages.

Deduct boxes 17 to 20 on your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-employment-sa102">Employment</a> page and the figure in box 2 above.</p>

You should use a separate copy of this helpsheet for each part. If you have not performed duties in the UK in the overseas part of the split-year, other than incidental duties, you need only report income for the UK part of the tax year. When using work days in a calculation, for example, at boxes 17 and 18 which follow, refer only to the UK part of the year.</p>

<p>If any of the amount in box 3 was earned in an earlier year or will be earned in a later year, enter the amount relating to the earlier or later year in box 5 in pounds. You’ll need to complete <a class="govuk-link" href="#part-3">part 3</a> of this helpsheet.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Duties can be treated as performed wholly outside the UK even when some of the duties are in fact performed in the UK, so long as the UK duties are incidental to the performance of the overseas duties. If you want more information about ‘incidental duties’ please contact HMRC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Earnings are regarded as having been remitted if the money, property or service was brought to, or received or used in, or enjoyed in the UK in any way. If your employer provides you with benefits in kind for use in the UK, those benefits will be part of your remitted earnings. For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad">Tax on your UK income if you live abroad</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax-liability">RDR1: residence, domicile and the remittance basis</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Foreign employer’ means an employer who is resident outside, and not resident in, the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Corresponding payments. The Commissioners for HMRC has discretion to allow certain payments made by a non-domiciled employee out of earnings from a foreign employer in circumstances corresponding to those which would have reduced his or her liability to UK Income Tax. If you think you qualify for a deduction, ask us or your tax adviser for advice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Days worked overseas are those days which have been spent outside the UK substantially performing the duties of the employment. This may include travelling, where the journey is itself part of the duties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Income which has already been taxed in another country. UK residents are ordinarily taxable on their worldwide income. Some qualifying individuals may decide to make a claim to pay tax only on the amount of their foreign income that’s remitted to the UK. You must make a claim to be taxed on the remittance basis in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc pages</a>. UK residents with foreign income should complete the Foreign pages – but read page TRG 2 in the tax return guide for circumstances where you do not have to. If your income from outside of the UK is also taxable in another country, you will not have to pay tax twice. The Foreign notes explains Foreign Tax Credit Relief and double taxation agreements. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/calculating-foreign-tax-credit-relief-on-income-hs263-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 263 Calculating Foreign Tax Credit Relief on income</a> for more guidance about the availability of Foreign Tax Credit Relief.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can claim relief for contributions that you pay to an overseas pension scheme that is not UK registered by entering the amount of contributions eligible for relief at box 4 in the ‘Tax reliefs’ section on page TR 4 of your tax return.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You may be eligible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>migrant member relief for your contributions to a Qualifying Overseas Pension Scheme (<abbr title="Qualifying Overseas Pension Scheme">QOPS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>transitional corresponding relief for your contributions to a scheme that’s recognised by HMRC as a ‘corresponding scheme’ (if you received corresponding relief on contributions that you made to the scheme between 6 April 2005 and 5 April 2006)</li>
  <li>relief under a double taxation agreement (<abbr title="double taxation agreement">DTA</abbr>) for your contributions to an overseas pension scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the ‘Any other information’ box, box 19 on page TR 7 of your tax return to enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name of the <abbr title="Qualifying Overseas Pension Scheme">QOPS</abbr> and its reference</li>
  <li>the name and ‘SF74 reference’ of the scheme recognised as ‘corresponding’</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="double taxation agreement">DTA</abbr> under which you’re claiming relief</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also provide confirmation that the scheme has been accepted by Pension Schemes Services as corresponding, or, in the case of the UK or USA <abbr title="double taxation agreement">DTA</abbr>, confirmation that the US scheme is of a type specified in the Exchange of Notes of 24 July 2001 as being a pension scheme under Article 3.1(o). In the case of the UK or Ireland <abbr title="double taxation agreement">DTA</abbr> you should instead provide confirmation that the Irish scheme is tax approved or registered for tax approval in Ireland.</p>
