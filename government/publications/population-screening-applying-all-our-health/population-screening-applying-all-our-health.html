<h2>Raising awareness of NHS population screening in your professional practice</h2>

<p>Screening is the process of identifying healthy people who may have an increased chance of having a disease or condition, enabling earlier treatment. Screening programmes can improve health, prevent disability and save thousands of lives each year.</p>

<p>Screening is a choice and individuals are offered information to help them decide if they wish to accept the offer of screening.</p>

<p>These videos explain more about population screening:</p>

<h3>The basics of screening</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeV42ITpbpU" rel="external">The basics of screening</a></p>

<h3>Screening offered to pregnant women and newborn babies</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afr5olIpTM" rel="external">Screening offered to pregnant women and newborn babies</a></p>

<p>The NHS offers 11 national screening programmes, covering 36 health conditions. Screening is offered to the different sections of the population most likely to benefit from it.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/uk-national-screening-committee-uk-nsc">UK National Screening Committee (<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>)</a> also recommends screening for reduced vision in children aged 4 to 5 years. Local authorities offer child vision screening using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-vision-screening">national guidance</a>. Find out more about child vision screening on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://phescreening.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/26/its-national-eye-health-week-a-year-since-our-child-vision-screening-resources-were-published/" rel="external">Screening blog</a>.</p>

<p>Every year the NHS offers bowel, breast cancer and cervical screening, antenatal and newborn (<abbr title="antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr>) screening, abdominal aortic aneurysm (<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>) screening and diabetic eye screening (<abbr title="diabetic eye screening">DES</abbr>) to millions of people.</p>

<p>While screening is offered to everyone who is eligible, certain groups are less likely to accept it.</p>

<p>Reducing screening inequalities and sharing best practice is a priority for the NHS. Health practitioners can help address some of the inequalities by making people aware of the NHS screening programmes and supporting them to make informed choices about screening.</p>

<h2>Young person and adult (<abbr title="young person and adult">YPA</abbr>) screening</h2>

<p>There are 5 NHS <abbr title="young person and adult">YPA</abbr> screening programmes:</p>

<h3>NHS bowel cancer screening programme (<abbr title="bowel cancer screening programme">BCSP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Bowel cancer causes about 16,700 deaths in the UK each year. Bowel cancer screening can detect bowel cancer at an early stage, when treatment is most likely to be effective.</p>

<h4>Who is screened</h4>

<p>People aged 60 to 74 are automatically invited to take part in bowel cancer screening every 2 years. This age range is gradually being extended, so that by 2025 people will receive invitations every 2 years from the age of 50 to 74. People aged 75 and over can request screening every 2 years via a self-referral process.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>Bowel screening looks for blood in a stool sample. Those eligible receive a home test kit by post and return the collected sample for laboratory analysis.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>Every year more than 4.5 million people in England are screened for bowel cancer leading to early detection and better outcomes.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bowel-cancer-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS bowel cancer screening programme (<abbr title="bowel cancer screening programme">BCSP</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS breast screening programme (<abbr title="breast screening programme">BSP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer. There are about 12,000 breast cancer deaths in the UK every year.</p>

<h4>Who is screened</h4>

<p>Breast screening is offered every 3 years to women aged 50 up until their 71st birthday.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>Breast screening uses an x-ray test called a mammogram to check for signs of cancer.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>About one in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. If detected at an early stage there is a good chance of recovery.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/breast-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS breast screening programme (<abbr title="breast screening programme">BSP</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS cervical screening programme (<abbr title="cervical screening programme">CSP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Cervical screening is not a test for cancer. It looks for abnormal cells in the cervix which, if left untreated, can turn into cancer. Every year almost 3.5 million women in England are screened. There are about 850 cervical cancer deaths in the UK every year.</p>

<h4>Who is screened</h4>

<p>All women and people with a cervix aged between 24 and a half and 64. People aged 24 and a half to 49 are invited every 3 years, and people aged 50 to 64 every 5 years.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>A small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and sent for laboratory analysis. The sample is tested for certain types of human papillomavirus (<abbr title="human papillomavirus">HPV</abbr>) that can, if the virus persists, cause abnormal cell changes which can develop into cervical cancer.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>If abnormal cervical cells are found they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Every year the cervical screening programme saves thousands of lives. In England cervical screening currently prevents 70% of cervical cancer deaths.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cervical-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS cervical screening programme (<abbr title="cervical screening programme">CSP</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS diabetic eye screening (<abbr title="diabetic eye screening">DES</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Diabetic eye screening (<abbr title="diabetic eye screening">DES</abbr>) checks for signs of diabetic retinopathy, a condition caused by diabetes, which damages the small blood vessels in the retina at the back of the eye.</p>

<h4>Who is screened</h4>

<p><abbr title="diabetic eye screening">DES</abbr> is currently offered every 12 months to anyone with diabetes aged 12 or over. Extra screening tests are offered to people who have diabetic retinopathy but do not yet require treatment and to pregnant women who have diabetes. This is because the risk of sight loss is greater in these people.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>Drops are put in the eyes to temporarily make the pupils larger and images of the retina are taken.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>If left undiagnosed and untreated, diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/diabetic-eye-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS diabetic eye screening (<abbr title="diabetic eye screening">DES</abbr>) programme</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS abdominal aortic aneurysm (<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>) screening</h3>

<p>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>) screening checks for weakness and swelling of the aorta, the main blood vessel that runs from the heart down through the chest and abdomen. Men aged 65 and older are most at risk of having an <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Who is screened</h4>

<p>Men receive a screening invitation by post when they are aged 64 or 65.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p><abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> screening involves an ultrasound scan of the abdomen to measure the width of the aorta.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>An <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> will often cause few or no obvious symptoms. If it is not detected early, it could get bigger and eventually burst. A burst <abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr> is usually fatal.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS abdominal aortic aneurysm (<abbr title="abdominal aortic aneurysm">AAA</abbr>) screening programme</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="young person and adult">YPA</abbr> screening for trans and non-binary people</h3>

<p>Trans and non-binary people will be invited for screening according to how they’re registered with their <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>. More information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-information-for-transgender-people">NHS population screening: information for trans and non-binary people</a>.</p>

<h2>Antenatal and newborn (<abbr title="antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr>) screening</h2>

<p>There are 6 NHS <abbr title="antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr> screening programmes. Different screening tests are offered at different times during pregnancy and after the baby is born. Every year about 650,000 pregnant women and newborn babies are offered <abbr title="antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr> screening.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-population-screening-education-and-training#antenatal-and-newborn-screening-timeline"><abbr title="antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr> screening timeline</a> outlines when pregnant women and newborn babies should be offered the 6 NHS <abbr title="antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr> screening tests.</p>

<h3>NHS sickle cell and thalassemia (<abbr title="sickle cell and thalassemia">SCT</abbr>) screening programme</h3>

<p>Sickle cell disease (<abbr title="sickle cell disease">SCD</abbr>) is the most common genetic condition in England and causes the red blood cells to become sickle shaped. This can lead to life‐threatening acute and chronic restricted blood flow to organs. People with thalassemia, the other blood condition screened for, need a blood transfusion every 2 to 5 weeks, as well as injections and medicines throughout their lives.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>A blood test in early pregnancy. The baby is tested for <abbr title="sickle cell disease">SCD</abbr> at 5 days old as part of the newborn blood spot screen.</p>

<h4>When the test is offered</h4>

<p><abbr title="sickle cell and thalassemia">SCT</abbr> screening should be offered as early as possible before 10 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>Early identification of <abbr title="sickle cell disease">SCD</abbr> and thalassemia leads to early support and more effective treatment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sickle-cell-and-thalassaemia-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS sickle cell and thalassemia (<abbr title="sickle cell and thalassemia">SCT</abbr>) screening programme</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS infectious diseases in pregnancy screening (<abbr title="infectious diseases in pregnancy screening">IDPS</abbr>) programme</h3>

<p>Pregnant women are offered screening for 3 infectious diseases: human immunodeficiency virus (<abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr>), hepatitis B and syphilis. The <abbr title="infectious diseases in pregnancy screening">IDPS</abbr> screening blood test is recommended.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>A blood test.</p>

<h4>When the test is offered</h4>

<p><abbr title="infectious diseases in pregnancy screening">IDPS</abbr> is offered as early as possible in pregnancy. Retesting is available at any time in pregnancy if the woman changes her sexual partner or feels she may be at risk.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>Specialist care and treatment can be offered to protect the mother’s health and significantly reduce the chance of the baby being infected.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/infectious-diseases-in-pregnancy-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS infectious diseases in pregnancy screening (<abbr title="infectious diseases in pregnancy screening">IDPS</abbr>) programme</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS fetal anomaly screening programme (<abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> offers screening to all eligible pregnant women in England to assess the chance of their baby being born with Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome or Patau’s syndrome and 11 physical conditions.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>A blood test. The physical development screen involves an ultrasound scan.</p>

<h4>When the test is offered</h4>

<p>Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome screening is offered at around 11 to 14 weeks of pregnancy. The baby’s development screen is offered at around 18 to 21 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>Pregnant women are supported to make timely personal, informed reproductive choices based on accessible, accurate and evidence-based information.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS fetal anomaly screening programme (<abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr>)</a></p>

<h3>NHS newborn and infant physical examination (<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr>) screening programme</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> includes 4 specific screening tests to find out whether the baby has a suspected problem with their eyes, heart, hips or testes, plus an overall physical check.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>Physical examinations.</p>

<h4>When the test is offered</h4>

<p>The newborn examination is carried out within 72 hours of birth. A second infant examination screen is needed between 6 and 8 weeks of age because some conditions appear later.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>About 2 or 3 in 10,000 babies have problems with their eyes and around 8 in 1,000 babies are born with a heart problem.</p>

<p>About one or 2 in 1,000 babies have hip problems that if untreated can lead to a limp and joint problems.</p>

<p>About one in 100 baby boys have problems with undescended testes that need treatment to reduce the risk of problems later in life, such as reduced fertility.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS newborn and infant physical examination (<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr>) screening programme</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS newborn blood spot (<abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>) screening programme</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme enables early identification, referral and treatment of babies with 9 rare but serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Six of the conditions are inherited metabolic diseases.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>A blood test.</p>

<h4>When the test is offered</h4>

<p>Parents are offered the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screen for their baby, also known as the heel prick test, when the baby is 5 days old.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening programme helps to improve babies’ health and prevent severe disability or even death. About one in 2,500 babies born in the UK has cystic fibrosis. Early treatment can help them live longer, healthier lives.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/newborn-blood-spot-screening-programme-overview">Find out more about the NHS newborn blood spot (<abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>) screening programme</a>.</p>

<h3>NHS newborn hearing screening programme (<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr> identifies babies born with a permanent childhood hearing impairment (<abbr title="permanent childhood hearing impairment">PCHI</abbr>). In England, on average, 1,400 babies each year are diagnosed with a permanent hearing impairment. Most of these babies are born to families with no history of hearing loss.</p>

<h4>The screening test</h4>

<p>Gentle clicking sounds are played into the baby’s ear via a small soft-tipped earpiece. Sometimes a second screen is required that involves placing 3 small sensors on the baby’s head, neck and shoulder and playing the clicking sounds via headphones.</p>

<h4>When the test is offered</h4>

<p>Ideally the hearing screen should be offered before the baby is 4 weeks old, but it can be done up to 3 months of age.</p>

<h4>Purpose of screening</h4>

<p>Finding and managing hearing loss early gives babies a better chance of developing language, speech and communication skills as well as making sure their families receive the support they need.</p>
