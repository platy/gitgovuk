<h3>Higher rate for corporate bodies</h3>

<p>From 20 March 2014, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/stamp-duty-land-tax-corporate-bodies">Stamp Duty Land Tax is charged at 15%</a> on interests in residential dwellings costing more than £500,000 purchased by certain non-natural persons.</p>

<h3>Higher rate for additional dwellings</h3>

<p>An additional 3% will apply on top of Stamp Duty Land Tax residential rates if buying a new residential property means you’ll own more than one.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/stamp-duty-land-tax-buying-an-additional-residential-property">higher rate for additional dwellings</a> applies for purchases which complete on and after 1 April 2016.</p>

<p>Where contracts have been exchanged on or before 25 November 2015 but not completed until on or after 1 April 2016, the higher rates will not apply.</p>

<h3>Rates for first time buyers</h3>

<p>From 1 July 2021 the special rules and rates for first time buyers apply.</p>

<h3>Non-resident Surcharge</h3>

<p>From 1 April 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-of-stamp-duty-land-tax-for-non-uk-residents">different rates</a> of Stamp Duty Land Tax will apply to purchasers of residential property in England and Northern Ireland who are not resident in the UK.</p>

<p>The rates are 2 percentage points higher than those that apply to purchases made by UK residents. This surcharge applies to purchases of both freehold and leasehold property, as well as increasing the Stamp Duty Land Tax payable on rents on the grant of a new lease.</p>

<p>The surcharge also applies to certain UK resident companies that are controlled by non-UK residents.</p>

<h2>Residential leaseholds</h2>

<p>If you buy a new residential leasehold, Stamp Duty Land Tax is payable on both the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>purchase price (lease premium) – use the Stamp Duty Land Tax residential rates</li>
  <li>‘net present value’ of the rent payable</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘net present value’ is based on the value of the total rent over the life of the lease.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Net present value of rent (residential)</th>
      <th scope="col">Stamp Duty Land Tax rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Up to £250,000</td>
      <td>Zero</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The remaining amount (the portion over £250,000)</td>
      <td>1%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Non-residential and mixed use properties</h2>

<p>Non-residential property includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commercial property such as shops or offices</li>
  <li>property that is not suitable to be lived in</li>
  <li>forests</li>
  <li>agricultural land that’s part of a working farm or used for agricultural reasons</li>
  <li>any other land or property that is not part of a dwelling’s garden or grounds</li>
  <li>6 or more residential properties bought in a single transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>A mixed use property is one that incorporates both residential and non-residential elements.</p>

<h2>Stamp Duty Land Tax rates and thresholds for sales and transfers on new non-residential or mixed use land or property</h2>

<p>The rates below apply to freehold and leasehold non-residential and mixed use purchases and transfers.</p>

<p>The Stamp Duty Land Tax rate is charged on increasing portions of the property price.</p>
