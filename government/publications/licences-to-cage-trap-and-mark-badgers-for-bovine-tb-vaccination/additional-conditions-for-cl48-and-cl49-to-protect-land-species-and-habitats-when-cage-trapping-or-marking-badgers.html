<p>The conditions and notes below apply to all land in England, above mean low water mark, including on and adjacent to protected sites: special areas of conservation (<abbr title="special areas of conservation">SACs</abbr>), special protection areas (<abbr title="special protection areas">SPAs</abbr>), sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and Ramsar sites.</p>

<p>If you are unable to comply with these conditions, you will need to contact Natural England at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:btbvaccination@naturalengland.org.uk">btbvaccination@naturalengland.org.uk</a> for advice.</p>

<h2>Licence conditions</h2>

<h3>Restrictions on vehicle use</h3>

<p>1. Restrict vehicle use to existing tracks only on any protected site. Protected site locations can be identified on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/magicmap.aspx" rel="external">Magic Map Application</a> by clicking on Designations, then Land-Based Designations, then Statutory.</p>

<p>2. Restrict vehicle use to existing tracks only within 200m of any marshy, reed-bed, riparian or other type of fen, bog or wet habitat, or alongside any waterbody (for example, a pond) or watercourse (for example, a river). This applies to any land – not just within a protected site.</p>

<p>3. In any location not covered by conditions 1 and 2, as far as it is practicable, restrict vehicles to existing tracks.</p>

<h3>Restrictions relating to cage-trapping</h3>

<p>4. Limit location of traps to existing sett footprint on any protected site.</p>

<p>Note: Traps and pre-baiting should not be deployed before 15 April.</p>

<p>Unless on a sett footprint, traps must not be placed in any marshy, reed-bed, riparian or other type of fen, bog or wet habitat, or alongside any waterbody (for example, a pond) or watercourse (for example, a river).</p>

<p>This applies to any land – not just within a protected site.</p>

<p>Do not use any fish-based bait.</p>

<h3>Restrictions relating to disturbance of birds</h3>

<p>5. Operations conducted under this licence must comply with existing legal obligations described in Note Y.</p>

<p>Note Y: All birds, their eggs and nests (while in use or under construction) are protected under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/contents" rel="external">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a>. This licence does not allow you to take or destroy such nests. Bird species listed under Schedule 1 of that Act have additional legal protection so care must be taken to avoid their disturbance during the breeding season.</p>

<p>6. Do not disturb colonies of breeding birds. See Note V.</p>

<p>Note V: Sea birds, gulls and some other species nest collectively in large colonies to breed in a variety of habitats. Persons operating under this licence will need to avoid disturbing such colonies. Depending on circumstances, operators will need to be up to a few hundred metres away but working at closer distances may be possible and can still avoid disturbance, such as by operating under cover or are screened from view.</p>

<p>7. Do not disturb large flocks of waterbirds. See Note T.</p>

<p>Note T: Large numbers of wading birds and wildfowl gather to roost and forage on and beside waterbodies, shorelines and other wetland habitats. Persons operating under this licence will need to avoid disturbing such birds when they are gathered in large flocks. Depending on circumstances, operators will need to be up to a few hundred metres away but working at closer distances may be possible and can still avoid disturbance, such as by operating under cover or are screened from view.</p>

<p>8. Do not disturb traditional raptor roost sites. See Note S.</p>

<p>Note S: Some species of raptors gather at traditional sites to roost overnight during the non-breeding season. If operating on a protected site, operators must check whether hen harrier, merlin or short-eared owl are listed as non-breeding features of interest on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">Designated Sites View</a>. If these species exist as features of interest on the site, it is recommended the operators contact the landowner or occupier to identify the traditional raptor roost sites to avoid.</p>

<h3>Restrictions relating to bats</h3>

<p>9. No access within 20 metres of any entrance to a cave, mine or shaft at any time of the year.</p>

<p>10. Activities conducted under this licence must comply with legal obligations described in Note Z.</p>

<p>Note Z. All bats and their roosts (even when not occupied by bats) are protected by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69" rel="external">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a> and by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/contents/made" rel="external">The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017</a>. This licence does not allow you to enter or obstruct any bat roost, nor to disturb any bat whilst it is occupying a roost. Care must be taken to avoid sustained human presence near, or artificial illumination of, cracks and cavities in trees and man-made structures, and of any mounted boxes.</p>

<h2>European protected species</h2>

<p>Note W: European protected species are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/schedule/2/made" rel="external">Schedule 2</a> (animals) and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/schedule/5/made" rel="external">Schedule 5</a> (plants) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1012/contents/made" rel="external">Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Nationally Protected Species are listed in Schedule 5 (animals) and Schedule 8 (plants) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69" rel="external">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a> (as amended). Under these laws (regulations 43 and 47 of the 2017 Regulations and sections 9 and 13 of the 1981 Act), it can be an offence to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal of a European protected species</li>
  <li>intentionally kill, injure or take a nationally protected wild animal</li>
  <li>deliberately disturb wild animals of any European protected species</li>
  <li>intentionally or recklessly damage or destroy any structure or place which a nationally protected animal uses for shelter or protection, disturb such an animal while it is occupying such a structure or place, or obstruct access to any such structure or place</li>
  <li>damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of any wild animal of a European&nbsp;protected species</li>
  <li>deliberately take or destroy the eggs of any wild animal of a European protected species</li>
  <li>deliberately pick, collect, cut, uproot or destroy a wild plant of a European protected species</li>
  <li>intentionally pick, uproot or destroy any nationally protected wild plant</li>
</ul>

<p>Great crested newt, otter, dormouse, and sand lizard are European and nationally protected species.</p>

<h2>Interpretation</h2>

<p>Within the licence conditions, use of the word ‘avoid’ denotes a prohibition, meaning it indicates that an area must be excluded from relevant activities or that activities must not be undertaken during the time period stated or in the manner described. Similarly, the word ‘restrict’ means that activities must be confined to the areas or time periods stated.</p>

<p>For further details on protected sites and their notified features of special interest or a European site’s qualifying features please enter the site name into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">Designated Sites View</a>.</p>
