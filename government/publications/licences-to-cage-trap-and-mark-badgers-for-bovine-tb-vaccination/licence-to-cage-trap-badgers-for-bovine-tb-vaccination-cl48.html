</li>
</ul>

<p>The Secretary of State will notify you in writing if your authorisation to use this licence is withdrawn. This may affect your ability to use any other wildlife management licences you may have.</p>

<p>Natural England may make pre-arranged or unannounced site visits to check you are following this licence’s terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>Licence conditions</h2>

<p>This licence only permits you to use cage traps to capture badgers so they can be vaccinated against bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> to prevent the spread of disease and for no other purpose.</p>

<p>You must meet all conditions of this licence.</p>

<p>You must also follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/licences-to-cage-trap-and-mark-badgers-for-bovine-tb-vaccination/additional-conditions-for-cl48-and-cl49-to-protect-land-species-and-habitats-when-cage-trapping-or-marking-badgers">Additional conditions for CL48 and CL49: to protect land, species and habitats when cage-trapping or marking badgers</a>.</p>

<h2>Condition 1: protecting animal welfare</h2>

<p>You must avoid causing any unnecessary suffering to badgers when using this licence.</p>

<p>You must not set traps to catch when weather conditions are, or likely to be, extreme (for example strong wind, heavy or prolonged rain, or very low or high temperatures).</p>

<p>Place your traps under natural cover to shelter trapped animals if extreme conditions develop after you’ve set a trap to catch.</p>

<p>Before you set traps you must have an attending vet available on call so they can be at the trapping location in less than an hour, if needed.</p>

<h3>Advice: how to protect animal welfare</h3>

<p>When carrying out the authorised activities under this licence, you must follow all relevant legislation. For further information, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wildlife-management-advice-notice-the-animal-welfare-act-2006-wml-gu02">Animal Welfare Act 2006: what it means for wildlife</a>.</p>

<h2>Condition 2: trapping in the open season</h2>

<p>You must only use this licence in the open season. This runs from 1 May 2022 to 30 November 2022.</p>

<p>After the open season ends, you must keep any traps left outside fixed open or closed so they cannot accidentally capture an animal. You must remove any bait or water from the trap.</p>

<h2>Condition 3: accessing land</h2>

<p>You must get explicit permission from the relevant landowner to access land you want to place traps on. This licence does not give you the right to enter private land.</p>

<h3>Advice: how to get land access</h3>

<p>You should get it agreed in writing from the landowner that you can access their land and get a map that clearly shows the boundaries of the area where they have given you access.</p>

<h2>Condition 4: placing traps</h2>

<p>You must not place traps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where they could block access to badger sett entrances or tunnels</li>
  <li>where livestock or domestic animals could disturb, get injured or caught in the trap</li>
  <li>where they can be easily found by the public</li>
  <li>along fence lines where barbed wire could injure animals in the trap</li>
  <li>in areas at risk of flooding</li>
</ul>

<p>Where traps are on a slope, secure them to stop them toppling over if a trapped animal tries to move inside them.</p>

<h3>Advice: where and when to place your traps</h3>

<p>Complete a thorough survey of the land so you know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where to set cage traps to catch</li>
  <li>the level of badger activity at the sett</li>
  <li>how many traps you need</li>
</ul>

<p>The best time to place traps is during the daytime. Avoid placing traps during dusk or dawn as this is when badgers are most likely to be active above ground.</p>

<p>For more information, read the guidance on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cage-trap-and-mark-badgers-to-enable-vaccination-to-prevent-the-spread-of-bovine-tb">cage-trap and mark badgers to enable vaccination to prevent the spread of bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Condition 5: recording and reporting your activity</h2>

<p>You must record the location of each cage trap you’ve placed (including ones that have been fixed in an open or closed position).</p>

<p>You must keep accurate and sharable records of where your traps are set. This is so another person can easily find your traps, in case you are unable to check them yourself.</p>

<p>You must report all activity you’ve taken under this licence to Defra. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setting cage traps to catch</li>
  <li>vaccinating and marking badgers</li>
  <li>releasing animals caught in your traps</li>
  <li>adverse reactions to the vaccine</li>
  <li>getting advice from a vet</li>
</ul>

<p>Defra may share this information with the Animal and Plant Health Agency and Natural England.</p>

<h3>Advice: how to record and report your activity</h3>

<p>You can download the Worldwide Veterinary Service (<abbr title="Worldwide Veterinary Service">WVS</abbr>) app to report your activity to Defra. Your sign in details can be found in the email that confirms you are registered as an authorised person.</p>

<h2>Condition 6: cage trap specifications</h2>

<p>Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions to safely set, use and maintain traps.</p>

<p>To capture live badgers humanely, your cage traps must be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/badgers-beavers-otters-and-pine-martens-how-to-trap-humanely">certified and suitable for use in England</a>.</p>

<p>If your trap was made on or after 28 March 2019, it must have a permanent mark from the manufacturer that shows its type and make are certified.</p>

<p>You must use traps that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are at least 1 metre long</li>
  <li>are at least 35cm wide and 35cm high</li>
  <li>are constructed from 5cm square 8-gauge mesh</li>
  <li>have a string-activated door</li>
  <li>have no sharp edges or other damaged parts that could injure animals</li>
</ul>

<p>In any part of the trap, you must not use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>polypropylene garden or baler twine</li>
  <li>parachute cord</li>
  <li>fishing lines</li>
  <li>electric fence wire</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advice: checking traps before placing them</h3>

<p>You should check your traps are in good working condition each time before you use them.</p>

<p>Replace or repair any faulty or damaged parts.</p>

<h2>Condition 7: using an approved triggering mechanism</h2>

<p>To reduce the risk of injury to badgers, you must only use approved triggering mechanisms and materials. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>twine, wire and stone</li>
  <li>twine triangle</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on these 2 methods, read the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cage-trap-and-mark-badgers-to-enable-vaccination-to-prevent-the-spread-of-bovine-tb">cage-trap and mark badgers to enable vaccination to prevent the spread of bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>Condition 8: checking cage traps</h2>

<p>You must check if your trap has captured an animal the day after you set it to catch. Do this as soon as possible after dawn and before:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9:30am in May to August</li>
  <li>10:30am in September</li>
  <li>11:30am in October and November</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have caught a badger that already has a fur clip and stock marker, which shows it has already been vaccinated that season, you must release it. You must not reset traps to catch at this sett or trapping location.</p>

<h3>Advice: how to check your traps</h3>

<p>If any traps you’ve set to catch have been out in unexpected extreme weather, check them first.</p>

<p>Approach traps slowly and quietly to avoid causing unnecessary stress to any animals inside the trap.</p>

<p>Traps should be checked by the same person who set them or a person who oversaw the traps being set to catch.</p>

<p>Your attending vet can provide treatment or advice if you have trapped a badger that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is or appears to be injured</li>
  <li>has an abnormal condition</li>
  <li>is found dead</li>
</ul>

<h2>Condition 9: vaccinating and marking badgers</h2>

<p>You can only vaccinate badgers captured under this licence, and mark them under licence CL49, if you have also completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-badger-vaccination-training">an approved vaccination training course</a>.</p>

<p>A qualified vet can vaccinate badgers captured under this licence without needing to register as an authorised person but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone who is registered under this licence must be present during the vaccination</li>
  <li>they cannot mark or release the badger once vaccinated</li>
</ul>

<p>Badgers can only be vaccinated if they’ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not been vaccinated previously in the same open season</li>
  <li>been assessed as being fit and healthy by the person giving the vaccine, using the objective welfare assessment from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cage-trap-and-mark-badgers-to-enable-vaccination-to-prevent-the-spread-of-bovine-tb">cage-trap and mark badgers to enable vaccination to prevent the spread of bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>After vaccinating the badger, someone who is registered to do so must temporarily mark it with a fur clip and stock marker, following the conditions of licence CL49.</p>

<p>After vaccinating the badger, wait at least 5 minutes to check if it has an adverse reaction to the vaccine. You must get help from your directing or attending vet if a badger:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collapses</li>
  <li>convulses</li>
  <li>cannot move</li>
  <li>develops immediate large swelling around the neck or face</li>
  <li>has been injured during the process of vaccination</li>
</ul>

<p>You must report any adverse or suspected adverse reactions to the vaccine as explained in condition 5.</p>

<h3>Advice: if a badger has died after being vaccinated</h3>

<p>If a badger has died from a suspected reaction to the vaccine, you should get advice from your directing or attending vet. They should advise you on what to do with the carcass.</p>

<p>For more information on the health and welfare assessment and dealing with any adverse reactions to the vaccine, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cage-trap-and-mark-badgers-to-enable-vaccination-to-prevent-the-spread-of-bovine-tb">cage-trap and mark badgers to enable vaccination to prevent the spread of bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Condition 10: releasing badgers</h2>

<p>After a badger has been vaccinated, marked and checked to see if it’s fit and healthy, you must release it at the point of capture.</p>

<h3>Advice: if you have captured a badger cub</h3>

<p>If you have captured a young cub, you should not release it at the point of capture. Instead, you should lift the whole trap with the cub inside it and take it to the nearest active sett entrance and release it.</p>

<h2>Condition 11: releasing non-target animals</h2>

<p>You must release any captured non-target animals as soon as possible, at the place of capture, unless they cannot be legally released.</p>

<p>If you trap non-target animals, what you should do depends on if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>domesticated</li>
  <li>wild</li>
  <li>wild and require a separate licence to be handled</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advice: domesticated animals</h3>

<p>If the animal shows no sign of injury, you must immediately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>release it at the point of capture</li>
  <li>return it to its owner, if possible</li>
</ul>

<p>If the domesticated animal is injured, you must immediately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get it treated by a vet</li>
  <li>inform its owner, if possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advice: wild animals that can be released without a licence</h3>

<p>If you trap a wild non-target animal, you must release it immediately at the point of capture, if it’s fit to release.</p>

<p>If the wild animal is seriously injured, and it would be inhumane to release it, you must immediately take it to a vet or kill it humanely.</p>

<h3>Advice: wild animals that cannot be released without a licence</h3>

<p>You must not release any animal that does not regularly live in or visit Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) for example, a raccoon or coati.</p>

<p>You must follow the rules for Part 1, Part 1A and Part 1B species if you catch a species listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/schedule/9" rel="external">schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a>.</p>

<p>For Part 1 species, such as Canada geese and ring-necked parakeets, you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>release it if you have a licence</li>
  <li>kill the animal quickly and humanely</li>
</ul>

<p>For Part 1A species, such as barn owls, red kite and goshawk, you must release it as soon as you find it, following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wild-birds-and-animals-licence-to-release-certain-schedule-9-species-gl22/gl22">conditions of licence GL22</a>.</p>

<p>For Part 1B species, such as beavers, you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>release the animal as soon as you find it, at the point of capture - following the conditions of licence GL22</li>
  <li>keep the animal in captivity</li>
  <li>release it at another location if you have a licence</li>
  <li>kill the animal quickly and humanely</li>
</ul>

<p>If you catch a species listed as an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/invasive-non-native-alien-animal-species-rules-in-england-and-wales#list">invasive non-native (alien) animal</a> such as a grey squirrel you must not release it. You must quickly and humanely kill it or give it to a premises licensed to keep it.</p>
