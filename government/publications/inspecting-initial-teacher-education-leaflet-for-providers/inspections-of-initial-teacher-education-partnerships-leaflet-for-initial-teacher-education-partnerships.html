<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page explains what you need to know about an <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspection and what information inspectors will ask you for.</p>

<p>Under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-education-ite-inspection-framework-and-handbook">the initial teacher education inspection framework and handbook</a>, inspectors will make judgements on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>overall effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quality of education and training across the provider</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management of the provider</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conduct during Ofsted inspections</h2>

<p>Ofsted’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conduct-during-ofsted-inspections">code of conduct</a> sets out the expectations for both inspectors and providers. At the start of the inspection (usually during the preparatory conversations) the lead inspector will explain these expectations and will ask providers to read the code.</p>

<h2>Information you will need to provide to inspectors</h2>

<p>Inspectors will need you to provide certain information for them to use as part of the inspection.</p>

<p>Some information must be provided by 9am on the day after the notification call; the rest must be provided by 10.30am on the first day of the inspection.</p>

<p>You can also find this information in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-education-ite-inspection-framework-and-handbook">initial teacher education inspection framework and handbook</a>.</p>

<h3>Information that providers must provide by 9am on the day after the notification call</h3>

    <p>a copy of the current staff list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of all provider settings, indicating where trainees are currently placed (if no trainees are currently assigned to a provider setting, inspectors will want to know when the last placement was assigned to the setting)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence of involvement in the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider of settings/schools/colleges that are based in areas with different socio-economic circumstances, and those judged as requires improvement and new academies whose predecessor was judged less than good</p>
  </li>

    <p>the number of trainees in each age phase and their subject(s)</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maps (where appropriate) and other practical information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information about the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> curriculum, including an overview of the training calendar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>handbooks or other relevant information for subjects/courses to be explored during a focused review as agreed during the preparatory telephone conversations with the provider representatives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a summary of any improvement planning, self-evaluation or equivalent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in primary and secondary providers, an overview of how the provider meets the requirements set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> core content framework</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an overview of how leaders and managers ensure compliance (where relevant) with the requirements and expectations of an apprenticeship route, early years, primary and secondary, and assessment-only route criteria</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to submit the information</h3>

<p>You should submit the information through the provider portal. We will provide instructions on how to access the portal when we notify you of the inspection.</p>

<h4>Information that providers must provide by 10.30am on the first day of inspection</h4>

<p>You can provide this information in electronic or hard copy on the day. Inspectors will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any further evidence or detail of improvement planning as a result of self-evaluation and the impact of this on the quality of the provider’s education and training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any available evidence of internal and external monitoring and evaluation, including external examiners’ reports and how the findings are used to improve the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any evidence of the involvement of settings, schools/colleges in the leadership of the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider and the process for the recruitment and selection of trainees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any evidence of how provider leaders meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010, including the public sector equality duty (where applicable)</p>

    <p>background information on relevant trainees, including qualifications, prior experience and, for postgraduates, information about their undergraduate/postgraduate qualifications</p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>any evidence (where relevant) of the quality and effectiveness of the <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider’s work in the areas covered by any annual focused thematic subject inspections</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Questionnaires to gather the views of staff and trainees</h2>

<p>Trainees give their views about their <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> provider using an online questionnaire for trainees. This is available during the summer term of each academic year before the inspection taking place.</p>

<p>At the start of the inspection, we will send you letters to distribute inviting centre-based and placement setting staff and trainees to complete an online questionnaire. These questionnaires are confidential and complement the evidence gathered by inspectors during the inspection.</p>

<h2>Online inspection survey</h2>

<p>At the end of the inspection, we will invite you to complete an online inspection survey.</p>

<p>This survey asks for your views on the inspection process. It also aims to find out the likely impact the inspection will have on bringing about improvement.</p>

<p>Your responses will help us to assess the quality and impact of our inspections. We will use your feedback to review and improve the inspection process.</p>

<h2>Further details about <abbr title="initial teacher education">ITE</abbr> inspections</h2>

<p>You can find detailed information about the inspection in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-education-ite-inspection-framework-and-handbook">initial teacher education inspection framework and handbook</a>.</p>
