<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by Home Office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> section). It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme.</p>

<p>It is split into 2 parts: (1) an assessment of COI and other evidence; and (2) COI. These are explained in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section analyses the evidence relevant to this note - that is information in the COI section; refugee/human rights laws and policies; and applicable caselaw - by describing this and its inter-relationships, and provides an assessment of, in general, whether one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules</a>/Article 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c=" rel="external">European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is able to obtain protection from the state (or quasi state bodies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a claim is likely to justify granting asylum, humanitarian protection or other form of leave, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a claim is refused, it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as ‘clearly unfounded’ under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" rel="external">section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each case’s specific facts.</p>

<h3>Country of origin information</h3>

<p>The country information in this note has been carefully selected in accordance with the general principles of COI research as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/48493f7f2.html" rel="external">Common EU [European Union] Guidelines for Processing Country of Origin Information (COI)</a>, April 2008, and the Austrian Centre for Country of Origin and Asylum Research and Documentation’s (ACCORD), <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.coi-training.net/researching-coi/" rel="external">Researching Country Origin Information – Training Manual,</a> 2013. Namely, taking into account the COI’s relevance, reliability, accuracy, balance, currency, transparency and traceability.</p>

<p>The structure and content of the country information section follows a <a class="govuk-link" href="#Version_control_and">terms of reference</a> which sets out the general and specific topics relevant to this note.</p>

<p>All information included in the note was published or made publicly available on or before the ‘cut-off’ date(s) in the country information section. Any event taking place or report/article published after these date(s) is not included.</p>

<p>All information is publicly accessible or can be made publicly available. Sources and the information they provide are carefully considered before inclusion. Factors relevant to the assessment of the reliability of sources and information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the motivation, purpose, knowledge and experience of the source</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the information was obtained, including specific methodologies used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the currency and detail of information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the COI is consistent with and/or corroborated by other sources.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple sourcing is used to ensure that the information is accurate and balanced, which is compared and contrasted where appropriate so that a comprehensive and up-to-date picture is provided of the issues relevant to this note at the time of publication.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a source is not, however, an endorsement of it or any view(s) expressed.</p>

<p>Each piece of information is referenced in a footnote. Full details of all sources cited and consulted in compiling the note are listed alphabetically in the bibliography.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Updated: 16 June 2022</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Basis of claim</h3>

<p>1.1.1 Fear of persecution or serious harm by the state because of:</p>

<p>(a) the general treatment and/or conditions likely to be faced by the person during compulsory military service duties; and/or</p>

<p>(b) a person being required to perform military service during emergency mobilisation, despite their stance as a conscientious objector; and/or</p>

<p>(c) the penalties likely to be faced by the person’s refusal to undertake, or their desertion from, military service duties; and/or</p>

<p>(d) prison conditions if a draft evader convicted in absentia is held in detention on return to Ukraine.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Points to note</h3>

<p>1.2.1 For information about whether the security situation in Ukraine is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm due to indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict, as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a>, see the Country Policy and Information Note on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-policy-and-information-notes#u">Ukraine: Security Situation</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Consideration of issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Credibility</h3>

<p>2.1.1 For information on assessing credibility, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<p>2.1.2 Decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a UK visa or another form of leave. Asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-matches-handling-asylum-claims-from-uk-visa-applicants-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Visa Matches, Asylum Claims from UK Visa Applicants</a>).</p>

<p>2.1.3 In cases where there are doubts surrounding a person’s claimed place of origin, decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/language-analysis-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Language Analysis</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Exclusion</h3>

<p>2.2.1 Decision makers must consider whether there are serious reasons for considering whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses is applicable. Each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits.</p>

<p>2.2.2 If the person is excluded from the Refugee Convention, they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection (which has a wider range of exclusions than refugee status).</p>

<p>2.2.3 For guidance on exclusion and restricted leave, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-instruction-exclusion-article-1f-of-the-refugee-convention">Exclusion under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a> and the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-leave-asylum-casework-instruction">Restricted Leave</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Convention reason(s)</h3>

<p>2.3.1 Religion - if a person is required to perform military service during emergency mobilisation, despite their stance as a conscientious objector.</p>

<p>2.3.2 Political opinion - if a person is a conscientious objector on moral and/or political grounds.</p>

<p>2.3.3 The individual circumstances must be taken into account when deciding on a Convention reason. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Asylum Instruction on Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a> for further information on assessing Convention reasons. See also the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/military-service-and-conscientious-objection-process">Asylum Instruction on Military service and conscientious objection</a> for further information.</p>

<p>2.3.4 Establishing a convention reason is not sufficient to be recognised as a refugee. The question is whether the person has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of an actual or imputed Refugee Convention reason.</p>

<p>2.3.5 Before considering whether a person requires Humanitarian Protection (HP), decision makers must consider if the person faces persecution for a Refugee Convention reason. Where the person qualifies for protection under the Refugee Convention, decision makers do not need to consider if there are substantial grounds for believing the person faces a real risk of serious harm meriting a grant of HP.</p>

<p>2.3.6 For further guidance on Convention reasons see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing Credibility and Refugee Status</a>.</p>

<p>2.3.7 For guidance on Humanitarian Protection see the Asylum Instruction, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Risk</h3>

<h3>a. Framework for considering claims based on national service</h3>

<p>2.4.1 Compulsory national service is a prerogative of sovereign states. It is therefore reasonable that draft evasion and desertion are criminal offences and punishable by law – points provided for in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.unhcr.org/uk/publications/legal/3d58e13b4/handbook-procedures-criteria-determining-refugee-status-under-1951-convention.html" rel="external">UNHCR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status</a> (paragraphs 167-174) and confirmed by the House of Lords in the case of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKHL/2003/15.html&amp;query=Sepet&amp;method=boolean" rel="external">Sepet &amp; Another v. SSHD</a> [2003] UKHL 15. The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.unhcr.org/uk/publications/legal/3d58e13b4/handbook-procedures-criteria-determining-refugee-status-under-1951-convention.html" rel="external">UNHCR Handbook</a> further notes, ‘Desertion or draft-evasion does not, on the other hand, exclude a person from being a refugee, and a person may be a refugee in addition to being a deserter or draft-evader’ (paragraph 167).</p>

<p>2.4.2 Therefore, a requirement to undergo compulsory military service – or punishment for failing to complete this duty – does not, in itself, constitute persecution. It will only do so where:</p>

<p>(a) military service would involve acts, with which the person may be associated, which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct; or</p>

<p>(b) the conditions of military service would be so harsh as to amount to persecution; or</p>

<p>(c) the punishment for draft evasion or desertion is disproportionately harsh or severe.</p>

<p>2.4.3 For further information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/military-service-and-conscientious-objection-process">Asylum Instruction on Military Service and Conscientious Objection</a>.</p>

<h3>b. Eligibility for national service in Ukraine</h3>

<p>2.4.4 Those who are not eligible for, or who are otherwise exempt from, national service are unlikely to have a well-founded fear of persecution or show a real risk of serious harm based on 2.4.2 above.</p>

<p>2.4.5 On 1 January 2022, the National Resistance Act provided for the recruitment of 120,000 civilian reservists who would form a territorial defence force, in addition to the 10,000 people already in place. In the event of mobilisation, they must report to their units within 24 hours. Members of the Territorial Defence Force would normally be required to provide support behind the frontline, but may be sent to the frontline if it is deemed necessary (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Territorial_defence_force_1">Territorial defence force</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.6 On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. On the same day, martial law was introduced for a period of 30 days and has subsequently been extended 3 times. The last extension was in May, when martial law was extended by 90 days, to 23 August. Also on 24 February 2022, President Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilisation in all regions of Ukraine plus the city of Kyiv. The decree became law on 3 March 2022, and mobilisation of conscripts and reservists was to be carried out within 90 days of this date. Males aged 18 and upwards are eligible, with no upper age limit in place. Males aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine as long as martial law is in place (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Russian_invasion_of">Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Martial_law">Martial law</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Decree_of_24">Decree of 24 February 2022</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.7 In April 2022, the Ukrainian news outlet Ukrinform reported that a draft law would make it a legal requirement for men outside Ukraine who are subject to conscription during mobilisation to return to Ukraine within 15 days of the introduction of martial law (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Return_of_men">Return of men from abroad</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.8 In peacetime, males aged 18 to 27 are eligible for conscription, unless they fall into one of the categories for exemption. The maximum age for military service varies from 45 to 65, depending on rank (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Eligibility:_age">Eligibility: age</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.9 Women who are aged 18 to 60, in good health and who work in certain professions (as defined by the Ministry of Defence) must register for military service. They may be required to carry out military service in times of war, although there are exemptions. In December 2021, the list of relevant professions was increased significantly (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Women:_registration">Women: registration</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Women:_mobilisation">Women: mobilisation</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.10 By law, various categories of persons are exempt from carrying out military service. This includes those who are unfit to do so for health reasons, those who are undertaking certain types of study, and those who have lost family members during military service. It is unlikely that all these exemptions apply under the emergency measures of February 2022, although a decree adopted in March allows men of conscription age (18 to 60 years) who have disabilities to leave the country (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#General_exemptions">General exemptions</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.11 The law also provides for certain categories of persons to defer military service. Grounds for postponement include a variety of family, educational and professional circumstances. However, deferment remains possible under the emergency measures taken in February 2022, albeit the number of categories able to do so appears to have been reduced. The current limitations in reporting also means it is unclear how deferments are being applied in practice (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Deferment">Deferment</a>).</p>

<h3>c. Whether military service would involve acts which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct</h3>

<p>2.4.13 ‘Acts … which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct’ is taken to mean being required to act in a way that would bring that person within the scope of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention.</p>

<p>2.4.14 There is no evidence of a generalised risk that military service would involve acts which are contrary to the basic rules of human conduct, and the onus is on the person to show otherwise.</p>

<p>2.4.15 Human Rights Watch reported that there had been incidences of Ukrainian soldiers abusing Russian prisoners of war; an advisor to the Ukrainian president stated that an investigation would be carried out, and, if abuse had taken place, those responsible would be punished. The scale and extent of the alleged abuse were not clear. Reuters further reported that Ukrainian troops had been guilty of sexual violence, but once again, the scale and extent of any such abuse were not clear (<a class="govuk-link" href="#Conduct_of_Ukrainian">Conduct of Ukrainian troops</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.16 However, if such reports are confirmed, they do not appear to be either sanctioned or condoned by the Ukrainian state and therefore represent the actions of a rogue element within the armed forces. They also do not appear to represent the actions of the Ukrainian army in general.</p>

<p>2.4.17 For further information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/military-service-and-conscientious-objection-process">Asylum Instruction on Military Service and Conscientious Objection</a>.</p>

<h3>d. Conditions of military service, and whether the requirement to perform military service puts the person at risk of serious harm or mistreatment</h3>

<p>2.4.19 Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, conditions for military service will have changed and, owing to the limitations in reporting, it is not 100% clear what current conditions of military service are.</p>

<p>2.4.20 Treatment received during military service may, in limited circumstances, be sufficiently serious by its nature and/or repetition as to engage Article 3 ECHR. Consideration must be given on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>2.4.21 A fear of being killed due to a requirement to take part in military service is not a sufficient ground for a grant of asylum or humanitarian protection. This is because Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights may be derogated from in relation to lawful acts of war.</p>

<p>2.4.22 In peacetime, the period of conscription is 18 months for regular conscripts and 12 months for holders of master’s degrees. Reservists retain their jobs and average monthly wages. In February 2022, an increase in wages was introduced for those defending the frontline (it is not clear whether this includes conscripts or mobilised reservists) (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Length_of_service">Length of service</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Reservists_1">Reservists</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Pay_and_compensation">Pay and compensation</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.23 On 5 February 2015, a law was passed which authorises military commanders to use physical force against soldiers who commit criminal acts such as ‘disobedience, resistance or threat to use force against the commander, voluntary abandonment of military positions and certain locations of military units in areas of combat missions’ (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Punishment_for_evaders">Punishment for evaders and deserters</a>). It has not been possible to ascertain how often such punishments may be used or how severe they may be. In some of these circumstances, physical restraint may be a proportionate and reasonable measure. Each case must be considered on its individual facts, taking into account the high threshold of Article 3 ECHR.</p>

<p>2.4.24 In mid-April, President Zelensky stated that approximately 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Deaths_of_Ukrainian">Deaths of Ukrainian troops</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.25 The law provides that conscripts are not sent to combat zones, other than to work in arsenals, and that they are not to be involved in military tasks in anti-terrorist operation zones. They are expected to serve mainly in supporting roles. However, The Times reported that untrained men have been conscripted since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and sent to war zones without having received appropriate training. It appears that this is because some officials have made their own rules, rather than following official practice and that men who have been displaced and travelled to western Ukraine for safety have been affected when registering in their new place of residence, as required under martial law; however, it is not clear how many have been conscripted in this way (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Conscripts">Conscripts</a>).</p>

<h3>e. Punishment for draft evasion or desertion, including conscientious objection</h3>

<p>2.4.26 Evasion of conscription is punishable in law by up to three years’ imprisonment. Desertion from military service is punishable by imprisonment for two to five years, and up to 12 years in some circumstances, which include a time when martial law is in place (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Desertion">Desertion</a>). Such penalties are neither disproportionate nor excessive.</p>

<p>2.4.27 Moreover, in practice, the courts issue fines or suspended sentences in most cases. Out of 295 draft evaders in Ukraine in 2021, none were imprisoned, 8 persons were sent to semi-open prisons, 175 persons were given suspended sentences, and 73 were fined (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Evasion_of_conscription">Evasion of conscription</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Punishment_for_evaders">Punishment for evaders and deserters</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Desertion">Desertion</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.28 The country guidance case of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2017/79.html" rel="external">VB &amp; Another (draft evaders and prison conditions: Ukraine) (CG) [2017] UKUT 79 (IAC) (6 March 2017)</a>, heard on 31 October and 1 November 2016 and promulgated on 6 March 2017, held that very few draft evaders had been subject to any criminal proceedings, let alone convicted of any criminal offence or sent to prison. It further noted the presumption in favour of bail for those awaiting trial and the removal of criminal penalties for minor matters. It held that draft evaders convicted in absentia would probably be entitled to a retrial and that there was no evidence that a retrial would result in a prison sentence.</p>

<p>2.4.29 The Country Guidance case of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2020/314.html" rel="external">PK and OS (basic rules of human conduct) Ukraine CG [2020] UKUT 314 (IAC)</a>, heard on 3 and 4 June 2020 and promulgated on 19 November 2020, stated that it was not reasonably likely that a draft evader avoiding conscription or mobilisation in Ukraine would face criminal or administrative proceedings for that act, even though prison sentences were provided for in law. It held that it was ‘highly unlikely’ that a draft evader would be detained at the border pending trial.</p>

<p>2.4.30 The situation in Ukraine is now different from when this CG case was considered. However, there are not ‘very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence’ to justify a departure from this caselaw. The onus is on the person to demonstrate otherwise, and such evidence must be considered if provided.</p>

<p>2.4.31 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2017/79.html" rel="external">VB &amp; Another</a> also noted that a draft evader convicted in absentia and sentenced to a term of imprisonment was at risk of being held in detention on arrival, pending a decision on any retrial. It further noted, ‘There is a real risk that the conditions of detention and imprisonment in Ukraine would subject a person returned to be detained or imprisoned to a breach of Article 3 ECHR’ (paragraph 90). Each claim must be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>2.4.32 The law provides for alternative service for those persons for whom military duty contradicts their religious convictions. However, unlike the situation with regular conscription, alternative service for conscientious objectors is not recognised at times of emergency mobilisation (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Alternatives">Alternatives</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Conscientious_objection">Conscientious objection</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Detection_of_conscripts">Search for conscripts</a>).</p>

<p>2.4.33 Paragraph 168 of the UNHCR handbook states that ‘a person is clearly not a refugee if his only reason for desertion or draft-evasion is his dislike of military service or fear of combat.’</p>

<p>2.4.34 Each case must be determined on the individual facts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Reservists</h3>

<p>3.3.1 Service by reservists is provided for in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://zakon-rada-gov-ua.translate.goog/laws/show/2232-12?_x_tr_sl=uk&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc#Text" rel="external">Law on Military Duty and Military Service</a> (Articles 1 and 2, Chapter 1).</p>

<p>3.3.2 On 21 April 2021, Interfax-Ukraine reported:</p>

<p>‘President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky signed the law On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine Concerning the Improvement of Certain Issues of Military Duty and Military Record Keeping No. 1357-IX, which the Verkhovna Rada adopted on March 30, 2021…</p>

<p>‘This document improves the requirements for manning the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations with reservists (military-trained persons with combat experience) in a special period without announcing mobilization. This will make it possible to quickly equip the military units of all the defense forces of the state with reservists, which will significantly increase their combat capability during a military aggression, as well as rapidly increase the combat potential of the defense forces and allow timely response to sudden threats to national security,” the statement on the website of the President’s Office said …</p>

<p>‘The president’s office reported that the law introduces a new type of military service - military service for the conscription of persons from among the reservists in a special period.</p>

<p>‘“So, in a special period, citizens who have entered into contracts for service in the military reserve and/or enrolled in the military operational reserve will be called up for military service. The decision to conduct such a call will be made by the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the proposal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The decision will determine the categories of reservists who will need to be called up, tasks, volumes, terms and procedure for the call and the like,” the message said.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.3 Interfax-Ukraine continued:</p>

<p>‘The law of Ukraine signed by the president is reforming the military accounting system and the activities of local military command and control bodies, based on European principles and approaches.</p>

<p>‘“In particular, it is planned to create territorial centers of recruitment and social support on the basis of military registration and enlistment offices; streamlining the issues of military registration of conscripts and reservists. The procedure for the implementation of military registration of reservists is being improved, including with the help of the automated information and telecommunication system Oberig (Unified State Register of conscripts, liable for military service and reservists),” the President’s Office said.</p>

<p>‘…on March 30 [2021], the Verkhovna Rada adopted a law on the creation of territorial recruitment and social support centers on the basis of military enlistment offices (bill No. 3553), which will allow reservists to be recruited within 24 hours in a special period without announcing mobilization.</p>

<p>‘As previously explained by head of the Rada Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Oleksandr Zavytnevych, the law concerns the introduction of a new type of service, which provides for contracts with reservists of the operational reserve [in a special period], allows to involve the already existing reserve promptly within 24 hours, in case of an aggravation of the situation at the frontline or violation of state borders. The reserve will include a small group of citizens who have already served and have combat experience.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>3.3.4 Interfax-Ukraine reported that President Zelensky had signed a decree on calling up reservists during a special period on 22 February 2022<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Territorial defence force</h3>

<p>3.4.1 On 25 January 2022, IWPR reported on legislation concerning a territorial defence force of civilian reservists: ‘The national resistance act, which came into force on January 1, 2022, mandates that in addition to the core 10,000 career personnel currently in territorial defence, a further 120,000 civilian reservists will be recruited and trained. In the event of any mobilisation, they will have to report to their units within 24 hours, swelling the ranks of the territorial defence forces to 130,000.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">4.4 </span> Call-up</h3>

<p>4.4.1 The Danish Immigration Service published a report in November 2021 which noted the procedure for call-up when martial law is NOT in place:</p>

<p>‘The source advised that as long as there are not declared martial law, the rules of conscription is actually very liberal. For example, if the military commission wants to call up a person who is on the list for conscription, the commission has to deliver the call-up personally. The call-up should contain the person’s personal ID and signature, before it is valid. This means that if the person is not home or he is hiding from the commission representatives, then he is not obliged to stand before the commission. The commission cannot do anything about this, according to the current legislation. So dodging in this way is not perceived as a crime, according to the law, as there is no proof that the person in question was called up, because he had not signed the call-up.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

For instance, in the western border town of Uzhgorod, stories circulate that recruiters are seeking out single men staying at hotels. At a press conference on 15 March, the army’s chief recruiter had to deny accusations that internally displaced men were targeted more often than locals. Even if one has sorted out the rules, the soldiers operating some fifteen military checkpoints now dotting the road from Kyiv to the western border may not agree with one’s interpretation.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Territorial defence force</h3>

<p>4.9.1 On 25 January 2022, Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) reported on a territorial defence force of volunteers:</p>

<p>‘As tensions continue to mount with Russia, Ukraine is mobilising a citizen militia that Kyiv hopes could be instrumental in resisting an invasion.</p>

<p>‘Thousands of volunteers flocked to join military efforts when war first broke out in 2014, but this new force is intended to be well-structured and better equipped, with the ability to be deployed rapidly across the country.</p>

<p>‘“The territorial defence is becoming a fully-fledged part of the Ukrainian army,” said Fedor Venislavsky, a lawmaker from the ruling Servant of the People party and a member of the parliamentary committee on national defence, security and intelligence.</p>

<p>‘The national resistance act, which came into force on January 1, 2022, mandates that in addition to the core 10,000 career personnel currently in territorial defence, a further 120,000 civilian reservists will be recruited and trained. In the event of any mobilisation, they will have to report to their units within 24 hours, swelling the ranks of the territorial defence forces to 130,000.</p>

<p>‘Officials say that this ambitious recruitment effort is expected to be complete by the end of February. …</p>

<p>‘Venislavsky explained that in [the eventuality of a Russian invasion], the territorial defence fighters would be deployed to ensure calm in the rear, enabling the 250,000-strong army to perform their frontline duties.</p>

<p>‘“This is not only the protection of authorities, but also critical infrastructure facilities, such as bridges or power plants, and their functions include countering sabotage squads,” Venislavsky said. “However, there is another change – the territorial defence moves from the office of the head of the ground forces to the commander-in-chief. And this means that, if necessary, these fighters can be sent to the front line, if the commander-in-chief decides that the time has come.”</p>

<p>‘The weapons available to volunteers – until now limited to small arms such as assault rifles and pistols for officers – will also be upgraded.</p>

<p>‘“Of course, we are not talking about heavy armoured vehicles, but in connection with the expansion of tasks they will receive both grenade launchers and mortar artillery,” Venislavsky explained, adding that Canada recently announced it would supply small arms and protective equipment to the Ukrainian territorial defence.</p>

<p>‘This will make it possible to provide volunteers with modern equipment in addition to the current, often Soviet-era, supplies.</p>

<p>‘“We have already formed 70 per cent - and in the border regions 100 per cent - of the personnel basis of the territorial defence and are beginning to receive reservists,” Venislavsky said. “In general, by the end of February - and in the border areas to the Russian Federation much earlier, most likely by mid-February - this work will be completed.”</p>

<p>‘Territorial defence officer Oleksiy Lapin said that the new system could be a game-changer.</p>

<p>‘“Until now, it was a lot of platoons which were united only by a common name,” he said. “Now it is a full-fledged military structure with its own hierarchy and control system.”’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup></p>

In total, this list includes 35 professional areas and hundreds of professions. There are not only technical or engineering specialties. Now the military records should be workers in the fields of musical and stage art, the apparatus of the judiciary, museology, library studies, journalism, advertising and public relations, social workers, art critics and literary critics…</p>

In particular, in the territorial recruitment center (as military enlistment offices are now called) an application is written, copies of documents about a person, education, work, marital status are provided. If a person is subject to military registration, he will be sent to the medical board, which determines the suitability for military service.</p>

<p>‘That is, for registration on military registration, women whose profession is provided for by the list must by the end of 2022 personally appear in the military commissariat at the place of registration and provide relevant documents, as well as pass a medical commission that will establish suitability for military service.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup></p>

They disguised themselves as Hungarians, trying to cross the border on the types of return to Hungary and the passports of gr. Hungary, allegedly, were published in the city of Berehove on the day of their trip. However, later they found passports of citizens of Ukraine, and they fell under the category of restricted exit… Subsequently, the police officers proposed, after compiling the necessary procedural documents, to send these persons to military registration and enlistment offices for draft evasion (or mobilization). The State Border Guard Service urges citizens not to try to offer money to border guards, because this is a criminal liability.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:81" rel="footnote">[footnote 81]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.5.2 On 16 March 2022, ICG reported that ‘In the few cases where men have been caught trying to buy their way out of Ukraine, the bribes reached $2,100 [approximately £1,609], about five times the average monthly pay in the country. Those who did not get caught likely paid a higher price, meaning that the poorest men may be the most vulnerable to dubious smuggling schemes.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:82" rel="footnote">[footnote 82]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.5.3 On 14 March 2022, State Border Guard Service of Ukraine published information which has been translated using Google Translate:</p>

<p>‘At the Rava-Ruska checkpoint on the border with Poland, border guards stopped two attempts to provide illegal bribes. The 28-year-old and 29-year-old men offered $ 5,000 [approximately £3,803] and $3,450 [approximately £2,624], 8,500 hryvnias, to avoid mobilization and flee Ukraine. The State Border Guard Service did not agree to any of the illegal proposals.

<p>6.5.4 On 21 March 2022, State Border Guard Service of Ukraine published the following report, which has been translated using Google Translate:</p>

<p>‘March 21, 2022, 16:37. Border guards of the Belgorod-Dniester detachment together with the Security Service and the National Police detained a citizen of Ukraine who was organizing the illegal transfer of conscripts to the Republic of Moldova. The organizer was a 27-year-old resident of Belgorod-Dniester district. For a monetary reward, from one and a half thousand dollars to two thousand euros, he “guaranteed” the unimpeded entry of men into a neighboring country. The man implemented the illegal scheme through advertisements on messengers and social networks. Within a few days, six young men from Odesa, Kirovohrad and Khmelnytsky regions expressed their desire to use the offender’s services. However, despite his efforts, he and six Ukrainian citizens were detained by a border patrol near the Ukrainian-Moldovan border. In the end, the shipper was declared a suspect under Part 3 of Art. 332 of the Criminal Code (Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine). The sanction of the article provides for imprisonment for a term of seven to nine years with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years with confiscation of property. The other six offenders were charged with attempted border violations and handed over to law enforcement.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:84" rel="footnote">[footnote 84]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.5.5 On 27 March 2022, UNHCR noted, ‘The UN HCR reported that the IOM developed a package of materials on the prevention of human trafficking that will be shared by the Border Guards. Partners report cases of men (particularly of 18-60 years old) resorting to smugglers to take them through irregular international border crossing points, due to presence of checkpoints where military conscription documents are reportedly granted while travelling on the main roads leading to regular border crossing points.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:85" rel="footnote">[footnote 85]</a></sup></p>

<span class="number">6.6 </span> Numbers of deserters</h3>

<p>6.6.1 The Global Security website published undated information which stated:</p>

<p>‘From 2014 through 2018, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost more than 33,000 people to desertion. As of early 2019, about 9,300 troops had deserted from the Ukrainian army. This is more than 4.5 percent of the total number of servicemen approved by the Verkhovna Rada in 2015. According to the first Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Ivan Rusnak, who voiced these data, such a number of deserters leads to a serious understaffing of the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AF)…</p>

<p>‘By 2018 Ukraine faced an ongoing flight from the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces - 11 thousand people broke the contract for the first half of 2018 and another 18 thousand were ready to do this before the end of the year. “For the Ukrainian army, if we consider that its real composition is less than 200 thousand people, every seventh quit or quit this year,” Yuri Butusov, editor-in-chief of the website “Censor.net”, said on August 5 on Ukrainian television. “Moreover, the most experienced and motivated servicemen will quit.”’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:86" rel="footnote">[footnote 86]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.7.1 Article 408 of the Criminal Code stated:</p>

<p>‘Article 408. Desertion</p>

<p>6.7.2 The Global Security website published undated information which stated that ‘Desertion remained one of the most common crimes in the Ukrainian army, the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine (GPU) has admitted. … Responding to a request from the StopFake project, the Prosecutor General’s Office said that in 2014-2018 investigators had sent to court more than 11.3 thousand indictments under articles “Desertion” and “Arbitrary leaving of military service”.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:88" rel="footnote">[footnote 88]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span> Travel abroad</h3>

<p>6.8.1 Global Security published undated information which noted:</p>

<p>‘Citizens of Ukraine military of conscription age traveling abroad must show a document issued by a military commissariat. Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak made the statement on 31 January 2015. “All the recruits that were called into the army during mobilization, based on the provisions, should provide the document (issued by a military commissariat -ed.) for traveling abroad. It’s like an auxiliary measure to determine the reason for traveling abroad and so on,” he said.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:89" rel="footnote">[footnote 89]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span> Punishment for evaders and deserters</h3>

<p>6.9.1 In November 2021, the Danish Immigration Service published a report which noted that ‘… there was not a single draft evader imprisoned, according to judicial statistics for 2021.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:90" rel="footnote">[footnote 90]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.2 The report continued: ‘Disciplinary battalions (disbat) are prisons for military personnel. These facilities are for military personnel who has committed disciplinary offenses. They will serve time in these disciplinary battalions, which de facto is the equivalent of a military prison. The disciplinary battalions are only for sentenced military personnel, and thus does not include draft evaders, conscientious objectors or evaders of mobilisation.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:91" rel="footnote">[footnote 91]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.3 The report further stated:</p>

<p>‘Pursuant to articles 335-337 [covering draft evaders] of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, draft evaders can be sentenced and imprisoned according to the law. Convicted draft evaders serve their sentence together with the general prison population; as such, these persons are not serving in the military and hence cannot be sentenced by military law. However, according to judicial statistics for 2021, none out of the 295 of such offenders was imprisoned. Only eight persons were placed in semi-open prisons, 175 persons got a suspended sentence, and 73 were fined.</p>

<p>‘According to the Ombudsman, military personnel currently employed can be punished by detention in a disciplinary battalion, which is under the supervision of the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<p>‘Within the disciplinary battalion, the imprisoned military personnel are subject to socially useful work, social-educational work, general education, vocational training and social influence. The ombudsman noted that imprisoned personnel could not be granted leave.</p>

<p>‘Pursuant to articles 407-409 [covering deserters] of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, deserters and the like also serve their sentence together with the general prison population, unless they have the rank of junior lieutenant or any rank above that. The officers are normally held separately, but there are no formal rules on this matter. Prisoners who served in the National Guard of Ukraine and the Military Service of Order are held in a special prison for sentenced law enforcement personnel, according to existing law. According to statistics on persons punished after articles 407-409 from 2020, out of 1,744 cases in 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>165 persons were imprisoned,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>8 persons received the sentence of disciplinary battalion,</p>

  <li>
    <p>148 were fined,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1,202 were put on probation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>‘Sentenced, former military personnel do not in general have problems with the general prison population; they are usually treated properly. The only reservation is that they cannot be promoted to higher levels of the internal prison hierarchy. Otherwise, they live under all the same common rules within the correctional colonies as other prisoners.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:92" rel="footnote">[footnote 92]</a></sup></p>

<p>6.9.4 Global Security published undated information which stated:</p>

<p>‘Ukraine’s parliament passed a law 05 February 2015 which authorizes commanding officers to use physical force against army defectors. It comes as the latest military draft has seen a lack of enthusiasm on the part of potential soldiers. … The new article 22(1) added to the charter regulating service in the armed forces of Ukraine states that commanders “have the right to personally use physical force, special means, and weapons when in combat” against soldiers who commit “criminal acts.”</p>

<p>‘Under criminal acts the law listed “disobedience, resistance or threat to use force against the commander, voluntary abandonment of military positions and certain locations of military units in areas of combat missions.” An explanatory note to the document said that currently there are mass violations of military discipline, in particular, desertion from units and drinking alcohol, as well failure to execute commanders’ orders.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:93" rel="footnote">[footnote 93]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.1 The US Department of State’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices covering 2021 did not contain information relevant to this section. However, the previous report, covering the year 2020, stated:</p>

<p>‘Human rights experts reported arbitrary detention in the context of conscription into the armed forces. For example, in late May representatives of the Kharkiv military registration office systematically stopped and forcibly detained young men near public transport stops, taking them to military registration and enlistment offices. The detainees were deprived of their cell phones, kept indoors, fed once a day, and sent to undergo medical examinations, after which they were conscripted.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:94" rel="footnote">[footnote 94]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.2 In November 2021, the UN Human Rights Committee (UN HRC) published concluding observations on the eighth periodic report of Ukraine in which it stated that ‘The Committee is concerned about reports of hunting for conscripts, including conscientious objectors, to deliver them to military assembly points against their will and cases of arbitrary detention of conscripts. It is also concerned about the lack of information on investigations and prosecution of such cases.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:95" rel="footnote">[footnote 95]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.1.3 The Danish Immigration Service published a report in November 2021 which stated:</p>

<p>‘There are call-ups two times a year and when nobody comes to the military commissions, they have to make a plan on how to get people enrolled in the army. The source stated that the commission together with the police would approach people at a so-called collection point, which could be on a street, at a cinema, universities or at exams. It is campaigns like this that KhPG [Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group] is fighting, because they are not allowed, according to the law. The source knew of cases where they had called up persons who lived in another city, and was only in that particular city to visit friends. It is something that the military commission do, only to get a check mark in their book, so they can show their superiors that they have fulfilled the plan.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:96" rel="footnote">[footnote 96]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Jehovah’s Witnesses</h3>

<p>7.2.1 The US Department of State published a report on International Religious Freedom covering 2020 (USSD IRF Report 2020) which stated:</p>

<p>‘According to Jehovah’s Witnesses, conscientious objection was not uniformly recognized. While courts and the Parliamentary Human Rights Ombudsperson protected the right of Jehovah’s Witness conscientious objectors to perform alternative civilian service, some military enlistment officials “arbitrarily” detained young Witnesses to call them up for military duty or denied them the right to alternative service. At times, district and oblast state administration officials denied Witnesses access to alternative civilian service. Some Jehovah’s Witnesses were reportedly detained for days facing criminal prosecution for “draft evasion,” in some cases because they had missed the application deadline to apply for alternative service as conscientious objectors. On April 23, the Ombudsperson’s Office reportedly informed the oblast state administrations that the right to alternative service was “of absolute nature,” and thus could not be limited by any deadlines. It criticized the practice of not providing alternative civilian service to a conscientious objector solely due to a missed application deadline…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:97" rel="footnote">[footnote 97]</a></sup></p>

<p>7.2.2 The same report noted the following experiences of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>

<p>‘According to Jehovah’s Witnesses, on December 10, the Ternopil District Administrative Court ruled that Jehovah’s Witness Ihor Zherebetskyi’s conscription into military service was unjustified because he had applied for alternative service.</p>

<p>‘On November 17, military enlistment officers reportedly detained Jehovah’s Witness Oles Tytokhod at his home, threatened him with prosecution for draft evasion, and escorted him to two local military registration enlistment offices. He was released after a 10-day detention.</p>

<p>‘On October 28, military enlistment officers reportedly escorted Jehovah’s Witness Matvii Pikalov to the Lviv Regional Military Registration and Enlistment Office and detained him for three days without cause.</p>

<p>‘On October 21, military enlistment officers reportedly escorted Jehovah’s Witness Ivan Nikitin to the Khmelnytsky Regional Military Registration and Enlistment Office, although he had been granted permission for alternative service. He was released after a nine-hour detention following his lawyer’s intervention.</p>

<p>‘On October 6, military enlistment officers reportedly escorted Jehovah’s Witness Nazar Duda to the Lviv Regional Military Registration and Enlistment Office, forging a statement on his behalf that he agreed to serve in the military. Duda was detained for three days, despite his statement that he was a conscientious objector. Duda was released after his relatives reported his detention to a prosecutor and his lawyer filed a complaint.</p>

<p>‘On October 16, military enlistment officers reportedly tried to deliver a conscription notice to Jehovah’s Witness Dmytro Tyshkovets, who had previously applied for alternative service. When Tyshkovets refused to receive the notice, stating that he was a conscientious objector, the officers accused him of draft evasion and referred the case to the police. Police opened an investigation, which continued through year’s end.</p>

<p>‘According to Jehovah’s Witnesses, on September 10, the Brody District State Administration rejected Vladyslav Prystupa’s application for alternative civilian service, saying he was not baptized as a Jehovah’s Witness. On February 13, the Yuzhnoukrainsk City Council refused Bohdan Boyko’s application for alternative civilian service, stating he was not a baptized Jehovah’s Witness. Authorities reportedly charged him with draft evasion and, on August 25, rejected Boyko’s second application.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:98" rel="footnote">[footnote 98]</a></sup></p>
