<p>As a condition of opting into the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund#accountability">16 to 19 tuition fund</a>, institutions were required to notify the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) of any unspent funding at the end of the 2021 to 2022 academic year for it to be reclaimed.&nbsp;To support this, we asked institutions to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>record the use of the funding, including whether a third party is being used for delivery</li>
  <li>refer to the individual students that receive the support and the needs of those students</li>
  <li>record the number of hours of tuition delivered</li>
  <li>retain the necessary evidence of the tuition provided and additional cost</li>
</ul>

<p>We confirmed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund#accountability">tuition fund guidance</a> that any underspend from the 2020 to 2021 academic year could be rolled over to support students in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. From 2021 to 2022 all unspent tuition funding for both years must be reported and will subsequently be recovered.</p>

<p>You are now required to report on the level of tuition fund spending in each academic year. If you only received tuition funding in one year, you just need to report your spending for that year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>If you overspent in 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>Only underspend in 2020 to 2021 could be rolled over to 2021 to 2022. If you overspent in 2020 to 2021 this will not be taken into consideration in calculating any recovery.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What happens if an institution has been renamed or has merged</h2>

<p>Where an institution has been renamed, the new name for the institution will show on your digital form, along with any allocations which were awarded under both the old and new names.</p>

<p>When institutions have merged, the tuition funding awarded to each institution before the merger will be added together, along with any award after merger and the name of what is now the lead institution will appear on your digital form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>My institution carried over part or all of our allocation from 2020 to 2021 but did not receive a new allocation in 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>If you carried over tuition funding from 2020 to 2021 but did not receive a new allocation for 2021 to 2022, you will need to state the amount of funding carried over that you spent in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>A completed return will still be required where you have used all your 16 to 19 tuition fund allocation on eligible activity detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund">tuition fund guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Please note this is a different form from that released for the second opportunity to opt in for tuition funding for the 2022 to 2023 academic year, which will be published on 3 October 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Next steps</h2>

<p>We will send you a link to a digital form so that you can tell us what you spent from the tuition fund for both the 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 academic years. The form will open on 10 October 2022. The deadline for the return of the form is 11:59pm on 24 October 2022.</p>

<p>You must complete this form if you received tuition funding in either 2020 to 2021 or 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What happens when we have received your digital form?</h2>

<p>We will calculate the level of underspend for each year. If an underspend is identified, the amount will be offset against your 2021 to 2022 tuition fund allocation. Underspend reported from the 2020 to 2021 academic year will not be recovered if the amount that was carried over was used for eligible activity in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>If your underspend for both 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 is higher than your 2021 to 2022 tuition fund allocation, the outstanding balance will be offset against your total mainstream 16 to 19 education funding.</p>

<p>If you have returned your form by the deadline of 24 October 2022, we will confirm the level of funding to be recovered in early November 2022. This will then be recovered by offsetting against your January payments.</p>
