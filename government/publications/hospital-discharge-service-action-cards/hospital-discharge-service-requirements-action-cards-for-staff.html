<p>These action cards are currently out of date and should not be used.</p>

<p>Updated cards, which are in line with the updated hospital discharge guidance, will be published soon.</p>
</div>

<p>This document outlines how your role helps to implement the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hospital-discharge-service-policy-and-operating-model">hospital discharge and community support: policy and operating model</a>.</p>

<h2>Key messages for all staff</h2>

<p>Early discharge planning from admission is required. All people who no longer meet the clinical criteria to reside for inpatient care in acute hospitals should be discharged as soon as possible on the same day. Any assessment of short and long-term needs should happen in the community via the ‘discharge to assess’ model.</p>

<p>Every local health and social care system should have a single coordinator who will act on behalf of the system to ensure timely discharge on the appropriate pathway. This role should be accountable to an executive lead.</p>

<p>Discharge home should be the default pathway (pathways 0 and 1). People may also be transferred to a non-acute setting (pathways 2 and 3). A case manager should be assigned to all those requiring health or social care (or both) and support post-discharge (pathways 1, 2 and 3). A transfer of care hub should link relevant services to coordinate care and support to aid discharge and recovery as well as admission avoidance.</p>

<p>Transfer from the ward or unit to a designated discharge area should happen promptly following confirmation of a medical decision to discharge. For people on pathway 0 this should be within one hour of that decision, and the same day for people on all other pathways. Discharge from the discharge area should happen as soon as it is possible and safe – often within 2 hours, or on the same day (preferably before 5pm).</p>

<p>People discharged to a care home (except those with a historical positive test within the previous 90 days) must be tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) within 48 hours prior to discharge. The result will determine transfer to either a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home">designated setting</a> (if positive and within 14 days of first positive test result) or care home (if negative) and will be communicated prior to discharge. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes">guidance on admission and care of people in care homes</a> gives isolation requirements for care home residents returning from hospital. No one will be discharged to a care home for the first time without local authority involvement.</p>

<h2>Medical staff (doctors)</h2>

<p>All people who no longer meet the clinical criteria to reside for inpatient care in acute hospitals should be discharged home or to a non-acute setting.</p>

<h3>Reviews and discharge co-ordination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ensure twice-daily multi-disciplinary review (consultant review at least daily) of all people in acute beds to agree who no longer meets the clinical criteria to reside for inpatient care and therefore should be discharged</li>
  <li>ensure clear clinical plans in medical notes to enable criteria-led discharge</li>
  <li>request immediate arrangements for discharge with a plan for virtual follow-up where needed</li>
  <li>limited functional assessments should take place in the acute setting. People requiring ongoing support should be discharged to assess</li>
  <li>the multi-disciplinary team need to clearly describe the support people will require when they are discharged or transferred</li>
  <li>for discharges to care homes, ensure the discharge summary includes the date COVID-19 testing was conducted (which must be within 48 hours prior to discharge), as well as the results</li>
</ul>

<h3>Safety netting</h3>

<ul>
  <li>conduct patient-initiated follow-up. Give people the direct number of the ward they are discharged from to call back for advice. Do not suggest going back to their GP or going to the emergency department</li>
  <li>if required, telephone people the day after discharge to check on them</li>
  <li>if required, call people after discharge with the results of investigations and their management plan</li>
  <li>manage people virtually in outpatient clinics under the care of the same team or speciality</li>
  <li>request community nursing or GP follow-up (or both) where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria-led discharge</h3>

<ul>
  <li>document clear clinical criteria by which the person no longer meets the criteria to reside that can be enacted by an appropriate junior doctor, nurse or allied health professional without further consultant review</li>
  <li>ensure arrangements are in place to contact the consultant directly for clarification about small variances from the documented clinical criteria</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you can stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>detailed functional inpatient assessments prior to discharge (describe need not provision)</li>
  <li>making decisions about the care people will need after discharge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Matron, ward manager (nurse in charge)</h2>

<p>All people who no longer meet the clinical criteria to reside for inpatient care in acute hospitals should be discharged home or to a non-acute setting.</p>

<h3>What you need to do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ensure twice daily multi-disciplinary review (consultant review at least daily) of all people in acute beds to agree who no longer meets the clinical criteria to reside for inpatient care and therefore should be discharged</li>
  <li>ensure every person has a clearly written plan which includes clear clinical criteria by which a person no longer meets the criteria to reside. Make sure the plan is communicated to all multi-disciplinary team members, the person and their carers, family and friends. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hospital-discharge-leaflet-for-patients-when-they-enter-hospital">patient leaflet</a> is available to give people on admission</li>
  <li>limited functional assessments should take place in the acute setting. People requiring ongoing support should be discharged to assess. The multi-disciplinary team need to clearly describe the support, such as the ‘discharge to assess’ pathway people will need on discharge</li>
  <li>liaise with managers of the discharge or relevant team in relation to people on pathway 0 (those discharged home without formal care and support)</li>
  <li>for discharges to care homes, ensure the results of COVID-19 testing within 48 hours prior to discharge are shared with individuals themselves and care homes in advance of discharge</li>
  <li>during every ward round, board round or case discussion ask the following:
    <ul>
      <li>does the person require the level of care that they are receiving, or can it be provided in another setting?</li>
      <li>what value are we adding for the person staying in an acute hospital balanced against the risks of them being discharged?</li>
      <li>what do they need next and what action is required?</li>
      <li>‘why not home, why not today?’ for those who have not reached a point where long-term 24-hour care is required</li>
      <li>if not for discharge today, then when? Ensure there is an expected date of discharge</li>
      <li>can a nurse or allied healthcare professional discharge the patient without a further review if documented clinical criteria are met?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What you can stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>detailed functional inpatient assessments prior to discharge (describe need not provision)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acute therapy teams</h2>

<p>A significant part of your work should now be in non-acute settings (mainly in people’s homes).</p>

<h3>What you should do differently</h3>

<ul>
  <li>limited assessments for discharge should be undertaken within a ward or other hospital setting or designated therapy assessment area</li>
  <li>assessments of care needs should instead take place in non-acute settings (mainly in people’s homes)</li>
  <li>acute therapists should assess people for short-term care needs to aid recovery in their own home or usual place of residence at the request of the transfer of care hub and agree a recovery and support plan with the person including reablement and equipment</li>
  <li>assessments should be trusted assessments and should therefore be accepted by any receiving care providers (a universal document to be used across acute and community services should be agreed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where you should do your work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you should work much more fluidly between community settings, people’s homes and within the acute trust, depending on the demand and capacity and learning from the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
  <li>cover should to be required over 7 days a week so you may find your hours of work adjusted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case manager role (where appropriate)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the transfer of care hub should direct (for each person) who should be the case manager to aid and monitor a person’s discharge and recovery</li>
  <li>acute therapists may particularly, but not exclusively, undertake the case manager role for people who:
    <ul>
      <li>have rehabilitation needs following illness or trauma</li>
      <li>require help to manage and self-manage long-term conditions</li>
      <li>have progressive illnesses where interventions can help them to maintain their independence for as long as possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What you can stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>detailed functional inpatient assessments prior to discharge (describe need not provision)</li>
  <li>equipment ordering for anyone requiring ongoing input</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bedded rehabilitation (therapies)</h2>

<p>You will need to decrease the overall length of stay to create more capacity and allow more people to benefit from rehabilitation. Your work may now have a greater focus on community outreach.</p>

<h3>How you should work differently with colleagues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>there should be a case manager assigned to each person and acting on behalf of the local health and social care system who should liaise directly with your unit to facilitate the discharge</li>
  <li>there should be an increase in the availability and timeliness of relevant services within the community to help people regain autonomy at home</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should do differently</h3>

<ul>
  <li>start a daily clinical review (10 to 20 minutes) of the plan for every person focussing on the key questions: ‘Why not home? What needs to be different? Why not today?’. Assess people for discharge against the clinical criteria to reside for inpatient care in community beds</li>
  <li>use ‘discharge to assess’ pathways as a discharge route from community rehabilitation beds</li>
  <li>act as a trusted assessor for onward referrals. You should not expect to have to re-do assessments, or to use lengthy referral forms</li>
  <li>you may use technology for outreach and follow-up to reduce travel time</li>
  <li>all equipment and care needs should be assessed within the person’s home using the locally agreed routes</li>
  <li>you should update the national Capacity Tracker Tool with your bed status to help with the management of overall NHS bed capacity</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where you should do your work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you may be required to provide outreach support to a person in the community. The transfer of care hub should direct the process</li>
  <li>cover will continue to be required 7 days a week so you may find your hours of work are adjusted</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should be able to stop doing:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>assessments on the acute wards</li>
  <li>detailed functional assessments for discharge</li>
  <li>equipment ordering for anyone requiring ongoing input</li>
  <li>assessment and discharge notification processes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adult social care teams</h2>

<p>A significant part of your work should now be in non-acute settings (mainly in people’s homes).</p>

<h3>How you should work differently with colleagues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in general, do not undertake social care needs or funding assessments in the acute hospital. Acute-based safeguarding investigations should continue</li>
  <li>where practical, agree a single lead local authority point of contact for each hospital site who should work as part of the transfer of care hub to coordinate care and support to people to aid discharge and recovery, as well as admission avoidance</li>
  <li>coordinate with housing and local and national voluntary sector organisations to provide services and support to people on discharge</li>
  <li>work with unpaid carers, providing them with support for caring for others and undertaking a carer’s assessment where needed. Children who may be young carers should be referred for young carers needs assessments or young carers support services as appropriate</li>
  <li>conduct Care Act (2014) assessments of long-term social care needs and funding eligibility, at the end of the recovery period, if required</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where you should do your work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>an adult social care (<abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr>) presence in the acute trust should be reduced but <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> staff will still need to work closely with acute colleagues and some presence, probably in the form of a senior social worker, will be required</li>
</ul>

<h3>Case manager role (where appropriate)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the transfer of care hub should direct (for each person) who should be the case manager to aid and monitor a person’s discharge and recovery</li>
  <li>social workers may particularly, but not exclusively, undertake the case manager role for people who:
    <ul>
      <li>have complex capacity issues</li>
      <li>have no recourse to public funds</li>
      <li>have identified safeguarding risks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should be able to stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>social care needs or funding assessments in the acute hospital setting</li>
  <li>assessment and discharge notification processes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Local system commissioners</h2>

<p>If not already in place, you should establish a single collaborative commissioning route for domiciliary care and care homes in relation to discharge with one lead commissioner.</p>

<h3>How you should work differently with colleagues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you should establish a collaborative commissioning approach and identify a lead commissioner. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Top%20tips%20for%20implementing%20a%20collaborative%20commissioning%20approach%20to%20Home%20First%20WEB.pdf" rel="external">top tips for collaborative commissioning</a>
</li>
  <li>you should jointly agree a place-based vision and commissioning priorities based on the needs of your community to support a ‘home first’ approach and avoidance of unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions</li>
  <li>you should consider what reshaping of the market is necessary to support a ‘home first’ approach and prevention and early intervention to enable people to live independently at home for longer</li>
  <li>the lead commissioner should work with the single coordinator to ensure issues in relation to flow through commissioned services are addressed</li>
  <li>ordinary financial controls should be maintained with respect to invoicing, raising of purchase orders and authorising payments</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should do differently</h3>

<ul>
  <li>expand NHS at home (for example, telecare and telehealth) where possible</li>
  <li>support greater use of personal health budgets and individual service funds to support mainstream care at home by directly employed carers</li>
  <li>establish contractual options to maintain continuity of care from providers supporting pathway 1 people at home when the ‘discharge to assess’ period of care is completed</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where you should do your work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you are likely to work much more closely with people engaged in different elements of the commissioning process from other organisations as part of a collaborative commissioning approach</li>
  <li>you are likely to need to work more flexibly to support the new requirements. Cover will continue to be required 7 days a week</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should be able to stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>intensive contract monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h2>Managers of the discharge team</h2>

<p>A significant part of your work should now be co-ordinating care input and oversight in non-acute settings (mainly in people’s homes).</p>

<h3>How you should work differently with colleagues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you may continue to liaise with wards in relation to people on pathway 0 (those discharged home without formal care and support). In some acute hospitals another team may be responsible for discharge of those on pathway 0</li>
  <li>homeless people (or at risk) should be referred to the local authority. Mental health clinicians should be consulted for people with mental health needs</li>
  <li>you should work as part of the transfer of care hub in relation to people on pathways 1, 2 and 3 (those requiring health or social care (or both) and support following discharge)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should do differently</h3>

<ul>
  <li>if responsible, arrange dedicated staff to support and manage the discharge of people on pathway 0</li>
  <li>ensure people on pathways 1, 2 and 3 are assessed for short-term care needs to aid recovery as soon as they arrive to their discharge destination (usually their own home or usual place of residence)</li>
  <li>ensure there is adequate capacity among case managers assigned to people on pathways 1, 2 and 3 to enable them to monitor progress against recovery and support plans and ensure assessments of any long-term care needs (if required) are undertaken as soon as it is possible to get an accurate picture</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where you should do your work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you should work much more fluidly between community settings and within the acute trust, depending on demand and capacity and learning from the pandemic</li>
  <li>cover will continue to be required 7 days a week so you may find your hours of work are adjusted</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should be able to stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>collecting and reporting various forms of activity, such as data on delayed transfers of care</li>
</ul>

<h2>Members of the discharge team</h2>

<p>You should continue discharging people on pathway 0 (straight home without formal care and support) if responsible. A significant proportion of your work should be focused on discharging people on pathways 1, 2 and 3 (those requiring health or social care (or both) and support following discharge).</p>

<h3>How you should work differently with colleagues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you should supplement ‘discharge to assess’ capacity, working as part of and directed by the transfer of care hub and supported by your line manager</li>
  <li>homeless people (or at risk) should be referred to the local authority.  Mental health clinicians should be consulted for people with mental health needs</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should do differently</h3>

<p>Responsibilities could include (this is not an exhaustive list and will depend on local arrangements and individual skillsets):</p>

<ul>
  <li>accompanying people to the discharge lounge and, on discharge, accompanying people home or to a non-acute setting</li>
  <li>carrying out reviews and assessments of people who are on the ‘discharge to assess’ pathways (pathways 1, 2 and 3)</li>
  <li>acting as a trusted assessor for care homes and community bed settings</li>
  <li>supporting people to manage their own recovery by identifying and activating their knowledge, skills and confidence</li>
  <li>supporting the effective flow of people (for non-clinical roles within the hospital and community)</li>
</ul>

<h3>When and where you should do your work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you are likely to need to work more flexibly to support the new requirements. Cover will continue to be required 7 days a week</li>
</ul>

<h3>What you should be able to stop doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>processing assessment and discharge notices because there will continue to be none</li>
</ul>

<h2>Single coordinator</h2>

<p>In performing this system leadership role, you should develop a shared system view of discharge, hold all parts of the system to account and drive the actions that need to be taken as a system to address shared challenges. Your remit may also encompass admission avoidance if this makes sense locally.</p>

<p>Critical success factors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a common purpose and shared vision – a clear and consistent focus on ‘discharge to assess’ (<abbr title="discharge to assess">D2A</abbr>) and ‘home first’ will help to generate commitment from all partners</li>
  <li>you should work closely at operational level to ensure <abbr title="discharge to assess">D2A</abbr> is a success</li>
  <li>you will need to work with and for the whole system and not be seen to belong to or represent one area</li>
  <li>you should quickly develop a working understanding of how a therapy-led approach can deliver <abbr title="discharge to assess">D2A</abbr>
</li>
  <li>enough decision-making authority – this will not only shape how quickly change can be made but also its impact:
    <ul>
      <li>you should identify and remove blockages and, where necessary, change processes across the whole system</li>
      <li>you should use your personal attributes and position as a senior member of staff to bring about change</li>
      <li>sphere of control – this will determine how your role can bring about change, whether through direct decision-making or by influencing</li>
      <li>you should direct discharge support services in the acute and community</li>
      <li>you should use conflict management skills as you make changes that best serve people rather than systems</li>
      <li>you should work at a micro and macro level and intervene in individual cases and change the overall process where required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>working with partners – working with partners earlier rather than later will make for more credible implementation:
    <ul>
      <li>you should deploy codesign and codelivery with all stakeholders</li>
      <li>you should constantly promote ‘the vision’ of a successful <abbr title="discharge to assess">D2A</abbr> model and ‘home first’ approach across the whole system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Every local health and social care system should have a single coordinator.</p>

<p>The single coordinator is key to the successful operation of a ‘discharge to assess’ service and their remit may also encompass admission avoidance.</p>

<p>The single coordinator should report to a named executive lead.</p>

<p>The single coordinator may be employed by any organisation in the system and can be from any professional background.</p>

<h2>Case manager</h2>
<p>All people who no longer meet the criteria to reside for inpatient care in acute hospitals should be discharged home or to a non-acute setting.  You should be assigned to people on pathways 1, 2 and 3 (those requiring health or social care (or both) and support following discharge) to aid and monitor their discharge and recovery.</p>

<h3>Discharge from the ward</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the person and any carers, family or friends are involved in and informed about what is happening and when. Patient leaflets are available for people being discharged home or to a care home.  A leaflet for carers is also available including information about a carer’s right to a carer’s assessment</li>
  <li>confirm the details of the pathway provision, including contact details, commencement, nature of the provision</li>
  <li>ensure transport home, or elsewhere, has been organised and any medications to take out (TTOs) have been ordered and will be ready at the point at which the person will be leaving the hospital</li>
  <li>if using a ‘settling-in’ service, liaise with the provider about timing and duration</li>
  <li>confirm any safety netting follow-up with the ward</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monitoring</h3>

<ul>
  <li>in liaison with the multi-disciplinary team providing support to the person, closely monitor and document progress against the recovery and support plan</li>
  <li>ensure adjustments are made to the support provided as required and in a timely way and the support is ended when it is no longer needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assessment of long-term needs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>after a sufficient period of recovery, where it appears a person may need support on a long-term basis, liaise with appropriate professionals to ensure timely assessment, for example a Care Act (2014) assessment or NHS Continuing Health Care assessment (or both)</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone who is discharged on a ‘discharge to assess’ (<abbr title="discharge to assess">D2A</abbr>) pathway should have a case manager.</p>

<p>The transfer of care hub should decide which <abbr title="discharge to assess">D2A</abbr> pathway (1, 2 or 3) is the best for the person and should identify who will be the case manager.</p>

<p>The case manager may be employed by any organisation in the system and can be from any appropriate clinical or non-clinical background – the case manager may change throughout a person’s journey depending on the person’s needs and local set-up.</p>

<h2>Transfer of care hub</h2>

<p>The transfer of care hub is the local health and social care system-level coordinating centre (fully or partially co-located with acute settings where suitable) linking all relevant services across sectors to aid discharge and recovery and admission avoidance.</p>

<h3>What the transfer of care hub is</h3>

<ul>
  <li>system-level place whereby (physically or virtually) all relevant services (for example, acute, community, primary care, social care, housing and voluntary) are linked in order to coordinate care and support for people who need it – during and following discharge and to prevent acute hospital admissions</li>
  <li>responsible for developing timely and person-centred ‘step-down’ or ‘step-up’ plans for people based on the principle of ‘no place like home’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discharge and recovery role</h3>

<ul>
  <li>supports safe discharges of people on pathways 1 to 3 through close working with the acute wards, quality assurance of information and practical support, including early identification of people who may become ready for discharge and identifying an estimated discharge date and pathway, focussing on the ‘home first’ approach.</li>
  <li>decides which ‘discharge to assess’ pathway each person should be placed on (1, 2 or 3) based on the description of the person received from acute wards; also assigns a case manager to each person being discharged</li>
  <li>works with the assigned case manager to coordinate and arrange the initial support needed on discharge, liaising with families and care providers
 *ensures the staff and infrastructure are available to meet a person’s short-term care needs as outlined in their recovery and support plan</li>
  <li>provides information about when and how assessments of long-term needs should take place and the financial implications of these based on a person’s identified status at assessment stage (for example, NHS continuing healthcare (CHC) or NHS funded nursing care (FNC) funded, local authority funded or self-funded)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the admission avoidance role does</h3>

<ul>
  <li>decides which pathway each person should be placed on (urgent community response – crisis response or reablement response standard) – based on the information provided during the referral process</li>
</ul>

<p>Every local health and social care system should have a transfer of care hub.</p>

<p>The hub should link a wide-range of health and social care and wider services.</p>

<p>The hub should play a key coordinating role to aid not only discharge but also admission avoidance if this makes sense locally due to overlapping services and staff.</p>

<p>The hub should operate 7 days a week, ensuring discharges are timely and urgent community response standards are met.</p>
