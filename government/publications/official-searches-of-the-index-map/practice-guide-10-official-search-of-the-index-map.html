<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Registered land</h3>

<p>Not all the land in England and Wales is currently registered. When land is registered it is given a unique reference number, the title number. Any sale of registered land is based on the registered title, details of which are held in the register of that title. If the land is unregistered, any sale, gift or first mortgage of it will trigger first registration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>The index map</h3>

<p>HM Land Registry keeps a computerised map based on the Ordnance Survey map. This computerised map provides an index of the land in every registered title and pending application for first registration (rule 10(a) of the Land Registration Rules 2003).</p>

<p>Any person may apply, using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/index-map-application-for-an-official-search-sim">form SIM</a>, for an official search of the index map (rule 145 of the Land Registration Rules 2003). The certificate of result will show whether or not the land searched is registered, the title numbers that affect and the type of registration that has been disclosed. <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">Types of registrations indexed on the index map</a> lists the different types of registration that can be revealed on the result of an official search of the index map.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Search to ascertain whether the title is registered</h2>

<p>An index map search is an essential part of the investigation of title on any transaction involving unregistered land for the following reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The land, or part of it, may have been registered already</li>
  <li>A caution against first registration protecting some claim adverse to the title of the applicant may have been registered</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be aware that the official search of the index map service is quite separate from the official copy service through which you can obtain copy title plans and registers relating to land known to be registered.</p>

<p>If you do not require indemnity provisions in respect of an index map search you could consider using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/mapsearch">MapSearch</a>. This service is available for Business e-services customers who have portal access.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the differences between a search of the index map and MapSearch.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Types of registrations indexed on the index map</h2>

<p>The following types of registration are indexed on the index map.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pending applications for first registration (other than of title to a relating franchise)</li>
  <li>Pending applications for caution against first registration (other than where the subject of the caution is a relating franchise)</li>
  <li>Registered estates in land</li>
  <li>Registered rentcharges</li>
  <li>Registered profits Ã  prendre in gross</li>
  <li>Registered affecting franchises</li>
  <li>Cautions against first registration (other than where the subject of the caution is a relating franchise)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following types of registration are not indexed on the index map.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relating franchises</li>
  <li>Manors</li>
</ul>

<p>These registrations are indexed in the index of relating franchises and manors which is an index of verbal descriptions arranged by county or unitary authority. You cannot search this index using form SIM. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-searches-of-the-index-of-relating-franchises-and-manors">Practice guide 13: index of relating franchises and manors: Official searches</a> explains what information this index holds and how to obtain it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Making an application</h2>

<p>You must apply for an official search of the index map using the prescribed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/index-map-application-for-an-official-search-sim">form SIM</a> (rule 145(2) of the Land Registration Rules 2003) or, for our business customers, apply through Business e-services or Business Gateway. For non-business customers, you must submit a postal SIM application to HM Land Registry. We will reject any application for an official search of the index map not made on the prescribed form.</p>

<p>An application in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/index-map-application-for-an-official-search-sim">form SIM</a> is not required where you know the property is registered and has a postal address but do not know the title number and an application for official copies is about to be made. You should lodge <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-copies-of-register-or-plan-registration-oc1">form OC1</a> with the words âPlease supply title numberâ written boldly at the head of the form. Please note, however, that this procedure may cause some delay in the issue of the official copies and you should make every effort to supply the title number in the first instance. We will reject âPlease supply title numberâ form OC1 requests where either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a plan accompanies the OC1, even if the property has a postal address, or</li>
  <li>the number of title numbers revealed exceeds five</li>
</ul>

<p>Where these applications are rejected, we will ask that you apply using form SIM.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Fees</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Applications in form SIM</h3>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-information-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Information Services fees</a> for details of the fee payable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Applications in form OC1</h3>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-information-services-fees">HM Land Registry: Information Services fees</a> for details of the fee payable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Additional fees</h3>

<p>We will inform you if your application attracts any additional fee under the current Land Registration <abbr title="The current Land Registration Fee Order">Fee Order</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you are paying using a HM Land Registry account we will contact you if the fee payable will exceed Â£25.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Methods of payment</h3>

<h4>5.4.1 HM Land Registry account</h4>

<p>Where a fee is payable, payment by HM Land Registry account is the most convenient method. Facilities are available to any person or firm authorised to use an account. If you wish to obtain such facilities, please write to request the necessary approval to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Service Access Team
<br>PO Box 650
<br>Southfield House
<br>Southfield Way
<br>Durham
<br>DH1 9LR
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>An applicant using HM Land Registry account facilities must enter the key number, and the other details required by HM Land Registry for debiting purposes, in panel 3 of the application form.</p>

<h4>5.4.2 Pre-payment</h4>

<p>If you do not have an account or do not wish to use it in a particular instance, please pay by enclosing a cheque or postal order made payable to âHM Land Registryâ for the minimum fee of Â£4.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Description of the property to be searched</h2>

<p>It is essential that the fullest possible information is supplied so that we can accurately identify the property on the index map. Where insufficient information is supplied we may reject the application.</p>

<p>The index map is based on the Ordnance Survey map and local authorities notify HM Land Registry of changes in street names and numbers. Consequently, we normally have up-to-date information and are able to complete searches of properties on the basis of house numbers without the help of a plan. In all other cases you should supply a plan with the application (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#plan-to-be-supplied-by-the-applicant">Plan to be supplied by the applicant</a>).</p>

<p>However, the mapping of new developments is not always immediately available and, therefore, we may require plans to identify such properties on the index map.</p>

<p>Where the search of the index map cannot be completed from the property description alone, failure to lodge a suitable plan will result in the application being rejected.</p>

<p>The application should contain as much of the following information as is possible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local authority serving the property. You must enter the authority to whom council tax or business rates would be paid for the property</li>
  <li>Postal number or description. Postal numbers are generally more reliable than house names. If the name or number has recently changed the former name or number should also be supplied. In the case of a flat or maisonette, include the floor level in the description</li>
  <li>Road name. In the case of new developments, give the estate name and plot number where possible</li>
  <li>Locality. This is essential where two roads of the same name exist within the same postal town</li>
  <li>Town. The town name required is the postal town. This is usually the town or city quoted in the propertyâs address</li>
  <li>Postcode. The postcode must always be completed where it is known. It provides us with a quick and accurate means of accessing our database</li>
  <li>Ordnance Survey map reference. In rural areas land and buildings may not always be easily located by a postal description and an Ordnance Survey map reference is then helpful</li>
  <li>Known title number. If you know the title number, it may not be necessary to apply for a search at all. If a search is needed to ascertain whether or not some other estate in the land is registered then you should disclose the known title number. This will assist in identification of the property</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Plan to be supplied by the applicant</h2>

<p>You must lodge a plan where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the land to be searched is not a property with a recognised postal description (for example, where the land searched is being described as âland atâ¦â or âland onâ¦â)</li>
  <li>there is any possible doubt regarding the identification of the extent of the property.</li>
</ul>

<p>The plan must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be drawn to scale</li>
  <li>be a copy of an extract from the Ordnance Survey map on the largest scale published (generally 1/1250 for urban properties and 1/2500 for rural properties), if the registrar so requires, showing the land to which the application relates</li>
  <li>indicate the scale and orientation</li>
  <li>show the precise extent of the property by suitable colouring/edging</li>
  <li>show the position of the land in relation to nearby roads and other relevant features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Properties in new developments or in blocks of flats may also require a location plan. Plans of flats and maisonettes should indicate floor levels.</p>

<p>Where a plan is required, the failure to provide a suitable plan that can be related to the Ordnance Survey map will result in the application being rejected. This does not mean that a failure to comply with one or more of the guidelines above will always prevent an application from proceeding. It will not where HM Land Registry is confident that the land can still be identified on the Ordnance Survey map.</p>

<p>It is possible that a plan lodged with a substantive application may be the subject of requisition, or lead to cancellation of the application, despite the fact that it has been previously accepted for a search of the index map.</p>

<p>Please note that HM Land Registry cannot supply extracts of Ordnance Survey map data it holds, either generally or for conveyancing purposes. Maps of a house or property for planning permission and/or submission to HM Land Registry are not available directly from Ordnance Survey or HM Land Registry. Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk" rel="external">Ordnance Surveyâs website</a> to find your nearest Ordnance Survey partner selling large scale maps for this purpose.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Spatial data</h3>

<p>Spatial data is created using Geographical Information System (GIS) software. Most large developers, utility companies, planning consultants, local authorities and other similar bodies are likely to have a GIS. When used appropriately, it can greatly reduce the time taken to process search of the index map applications.
Spatial data can only be submitted in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the requirements set out in the sections above.</p>

<p>Our requirements for spatial data are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we only accept ESRI shapefile (.shp), MapInfo (.MID/.MIF) and TMF file formats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>polygons must be captured against large-scale Ordnance Survey mapping</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>coordinate reference system OSGB 1936 British National Grid must be used in order for the polygons to be compatible with our mapping system</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Spatial data cannot currently be lodged through the portal or Business Gateway but as an attachment in an email. If you have available spatial data you believe may assist in processing your SIM application please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-hm-land-registry">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Certificate of result</h2>

<p>Wherever possible, we will issue the certificate of result of the search electronically. The certificate of result will show whether the land searched is registered, subject to a pending application for first registration or subject to a pending application to register a caution against first registration. It will state the title numbers that affect and the type and tenure of registrations that have been disclosed.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances can we provide the result of a SIM over the telephone or by email.</p>

<p>You should lodge the certificate of result of the search on any subsequent correspondence or application for first registration.</p>

<p>Most SIM results will be issued in a textual format without a plan. HM Land Registry may issue a plan in circumstances when it is felt that the area searched needs to be qualified.</p>

<p>The maximum size for a SIM plan is A3 at a scale of 1:2500. To complement the textual result, we offer an Illustrative Plans service. This provides a pictorial representation of how titles piece together using the latest Ordnance Survey detail. The service does not extend the certificate of guarantee afforded to a SIM result but uses the result as the basis to illustrate the titles revealed. If you would like to discuss our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/illustrative-plans">Illustrative Plans service</a>, please contact our Add Value Team at Birkenhead Office on 0300 006 0478 or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:commercial.services@landregistry.gov.uk">email</a>.</p>

<p>All plans issued with the result of a search of the index map are for illustrative purposes only and do not define the extent of the land in any individual title. They are prepared for the sole purpose of showing the area in respect of which an official search has been made. They should not be re-used on a subsequent application for registration. If you require Ordnance Survey large scale mapping, extracts may be purchased from an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk" rel="external">Ordnance Survey Mapping and Data Centre</a>.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry index map plans are not provided as part of the statutory service and are not a substitute for official copies.</p>

<p>You can obtain an official copy of a title plan and register for further information about a registered title, including its extent. Official copies of title plans have the following note about general boundaries:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>âThis title plan shows the general position, not the exact line, of the boundaries. It may be subject to distortions in scale. Measurements scaled from this plan may not match measurements between the same points on the ground.â</p>
</div>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/your-property-boundaries">Your property boundaries</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspection-and-application-for-official-copies">Practice guide 11: inspection and application for official copies</a> explains how to obtain official copies of registers and title plans.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Correspondence on boundary or title problems</h2>

<p>The system of issuing certificates of an official search of the index map is a service provided mainly to enable a prospective purchaser to establish whether or not a registered title exists for a property so a transaction can be completed speedily and effectively. For the service to operate efficiently, it is important to ensure that correspondence or enquiries relating to registered land are submitted separately from any application for an index map search.</p>

<p>You should make enquiries relating to boundaries or title to land the subject of separate correspondence after having made an official search of the index map.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Large or complex applications</h2>

<p>Where searches affect a large area or an area of complex registrations, it would be helpful if you contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-hm-land-registry">HM Land Registry</a>. You should do this before lodging the searches so we can make arrangements to discuss your requirements and our procedures and services with you. This may offer benefits to both parties.</p>
