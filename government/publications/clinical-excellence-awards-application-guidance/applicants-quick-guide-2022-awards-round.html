<h2>Part 1: about the Clinical Impact Awards</h2>

<p>Since the NHS was formed in 1948, there have been awards for NHS consultants who make outstanding contributions. In 2021, a consultation on the national Clinical Excellence Awards sought to increase the number of awards and broaden the diversity of award holders. This is to facilitate the driving of innovation across all disciplines, enabling breakthroughs and improvements in patient care.</p>

<p>The result is the national Clinical Impact Awards (<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>) – an updated awards scheme that is simpler, more relevant and with wider reach. The awards are designed to recognise and retain dedicated clinicians who lead the way in the provision and improvement of patient care, demonstrating national impact by going above and beyond their demanding roles. They are run by the Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>).</p>

<p>You can find more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a> and read about the awards on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> home page</a> – if you have a question that is not covered, see the full guide or email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>What the changes bring</h3>

<h4>More awards</h4>

<p>After the transition period, we plan to have up to 600 awards each year in England and 37 in Wales.</p>

<h4>A new brand</h4>

<p>The national Clinical Impact Awards shows that it is the effectiveness of the work you do that matters.</p>

<h4>3 award levels</h4>

<p>In England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>national 1 (lowest)</li>
  <li>national 2</li>
  <li>national 3 (highest)</li>
</ul>

<p>Four levels in Wales: 0 to 3, plus commitment awards.</p>

<h4>5 domains</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Service delivery and development</li>
  <li>Leadership</li>
  <li>Education, training and people development</li>
  <li>Innovation and research</li>
  <li>Additional national impact</li>
</ol>

<h4>An easier application process</h4>

<p>A single-level application process, and the level of the award you get is based on your score so you can get a higher award more quickly.</p>

<h4>Simplified for employers</h4>

<p>Employers only need to indicate their support or lack of support, and provide a citation for each applicant.</p>

<h4>No pro-rated awards</h4>

<p>Those working less than full time (<abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr>) will receive the full value of award payments.</p>

<h4>No renewals</h4>

<p>All awards are held for 5 years. You can then re-apply for a new award.</p>

<h4>No pensionability</h4>

<p><abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are not pensionable or consolidated.</p>

<h3>Why you should apply</h3>

<p>When you apply, you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demonstrate and be recognised for what you have achieved nationally</li>
  <li>share your work with your peers</li>
  <li>support your sector and showcase what you have delivered</li>
  <li>inspire colleagues to strive for innovation – which in turn will bring further benefits and improvements for patients</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are successful, you will be recognised with a financial award that reflects your outstanding contribution.</p>

<p>Completing your application will take time and commitment, however there is plenty of support available. Use this quick guide to understand what is needed for each level of the awards, and start to think about your evidence. There is other support you can draw on (see part 4 below). Read through the main guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a> so you can be confident you have covered everything before submitting your application.</p>

<h2>Part 2: who can qualify</h2>

<p>The awards are for NHS consultants and academic GPs based in England and Wales who are registered on either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General Dental Council (<abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>) specialist list</li>
  <li>General Medical Council (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>) specialist list</li>
  <li>GP register</li>
</ul>

<p>You will qualify if you are a permanent NHS consultant or on an honorary contract who is fully registered with a licence to practise, and fulfil the relevant following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an academic GP in a permanent clinical academic role in higher education at senior lecturer level or above</li>
  <li>employed by the NHS, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or its arm’s length bodies, a university, medical or dental school, local authority or a Welsh government-associated organisation</li>
  <li>in role for at least one year, on 1 April in the award year</li>
  <li>in England – on an NHS consultant contract expressed in programmed activities (<abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>), or an academic contract expressed in an equivalent pay scale</li>
  <li>in Wales – on an NHS consultant contract expressed in sessions</li>
  <li>working a minimum of 3 clinically relevant contracted <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr> – if you work less than full-time</li>
</ul>

<p>Full details about what your role needs to involve is available in the main guidance. It also covers reasons you may not be eligible, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are not on the consultant pay scale as expressed in <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr> or an equivalent</li>
  <li>if you are a locum consultant</li>
  <li>if you work in general management without a specific clinical role</li>
  <li>if you are not fully registered with a licence to practise</li>
</ul>

<p>Overseas work that has not helped the NHS and public health directly or had a direct reputational benefit for the NHS overseas is not eligible. You also need to let us know about any disciplinary investigations or sanctions, as these could affect your application or any award you receive.</p>

<h3>The application process</h3>

<p>All applications are completed online at the new <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application portal and must be submitted by 5pm on 22 June 2022. Read the available guides and log into the portal early. You can log back in and edit your application up until you submit it – but you should save it regularly until you are satisfied that it’s complete. You can also print your application, but you must fill in the online application yourself – no one else can do it for you.</p>

<h4>How we’ve simplified it</h4>

<p>We’ve simplified our processes to make applying for an award easier:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you only need to submit one online application for scoring</li>
  <li>you can only have one ranking and citation from one relevant national nominating organisation (<abbr title="national nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the aim after the transition period is for up to 600 new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> each year in England – split 330 x <abbr title="national 1">N1</abbr> at £20,000, 200 x <abbr title="national 2">N2</abbr> at £30,000 and 70 x <abbr title="national 3">N3</abbr> at £40,000 – with up to 37 awards in Wales</li>
  <li>scoring groups and numbers are balanced to optimise committee diversity and help to avoid unconscious bias</li>
  <li>applications from those with a disability or extenuating circumstances are welcomed with the relevant supporting information</li>
  <li>all applications are scored against the same criteria</li>
  <li>each region has an equal opportunity for success with an indicative number of awards at each level (<abbr title="national 1">N1</abbr>, <abbr title="national 2">N2</abbr> or <abbr title="national 3">N3</abbr>) based on application numbers</li>
  <li>tied applications are rescored by the National Reserve Sub-committee (<abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>), along with those identified through national governance review</li>
  <li>regional sub-committees and the main committee recommend applicants for national awards to ministers for them to approve</li>
  <li>each region’s highest scoring applicants are pooled nationally and rescored by the <abbr title="national 3">N3</abbr> committee to agree those most deserving of the highest award – those who are unsuccessful at <abbr title="national 3">N3</abbr> receive an <abbr title="national 2">N2</abbr> award</li>
  <li>if you successfully gain an award it will last 5 years, backdated to 1 April 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you start your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read the guides so you know what is expected – and by when</li>
  <li>plan your timings to allow for sign off from your employer, local trust, university and <abbr title="national nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> process</li>
  <li>check your employer’s or employers’ email address with your trust administrator</li>
  <li>if there are special circumstances that could affect your application, like ill health or other extenuating circumstances, tell us before the deadline, preferably before you finish your application and include details in your application</li>
</ul>

<h3>Each step of your application</h3>

<h4>Step 1: sign in</h4>

<p>Once the application window opens on 27 April, go to the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application portal and register. Because the&nbsp;application portal is new, you need to select ‘New to the System’ and complete the form as a ‘Contact of an Existing Employer’, even if you’ve registered before. If your employer is not listed, contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>. You will get an email with your login details and be asked to set up a password.</p>

<h4>Step 2: privacy notice</h4>

<p>You need to agree to how we collect, process and store your information.</p>

<h4>Step 3: start your application</h4>

<p>Select ‘Apply for a Clinical Impact Award’ and the ‘2022 Award Round’, or ‘In Progress’ application if you are logging in again to continue editing.&nbsp;We are still in the process of migrating data to the new system, so if you have any current awards they may not show in the ‘Historical Awards’ tab yet.</p>

<h4>Step 4: request support from <abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you know which <abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> you want to ask to support your application, specify them here – or you can add them later. Things to take into account when approaching an <abbr title="national nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> for support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you can enter up to 2 <abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> but only one can support you, so if you enter 2 you’ll need to remove one before you submit your application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you still need to approach the <abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> you specify to ask for their support through their process&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> can enter the details of their support after you submit your application – you don’t need their input as part of your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> cannot access applications which don’t include a request for support, so as well as asking an <abbr title="national nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> directly, you must include a request in your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you wish to change the <abbr title="national nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> after you’ve selected them, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 5: complete your applicant profile</h4>

<p>This information is for our monitoring purposes. Some information is not visible to scorers to minimise any unconscious or other bias. You need to add your:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>personal and contact details&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> and/or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> registration&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>current employment details for your primary NHS employer and primary non-NHS employer, if you have one&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pension scheme membership and if you are an academic or teaching consultant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accredited speciality and any sub-specialities, if relevant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>background and diversity details&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can save your work at any time using the button in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>When you are ready&nbsp;to submit your application, you need to click the bottom right corner to submit your profile.</p>

<h4>Step 6: your application details</h4>

<p>Complete the ‘Details’ tab with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your consultant appointments in date order&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the year you were appointed to consultant grade&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your primary medical qualification – including the year and institution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any post-graduate qualifications – including the year and institution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any current national award level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your registration and licencing status&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your personal statement along with your permission for us to publish it, if you are successful&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if your primary employer is in England or Wales&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have taken any part of your pension or retired and returned to work – if so, provide the date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you received a new national Clinical Excellence Award at any level in either the 2018 or 2019 competition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if your most recent national award was withdrawn&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you are also applying for a local award in 2022</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Save your work frequently using the button at the bottom of the page. You will need to have completed all the mandatory fields before you can submit your application.</p>

<h4>Step 7:  your job plan</h4>

<p>Use the ‘Job Plan’ tab to tell us:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of direct clinical care, academic, supporting professional activities, and planned programmed activities that are specified in your agreed job plan&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the activities you do for each of your <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>, including any changes&nbsp;in the last 5 years&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other sessions&nbsp;you are paid for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any sessions you are not paid for&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any additional income from any wider role outside your job plan – if you have additional income, explain&nbsp;how it relates to the evidence in your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any extenuating circumstances</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 8: domains</h4>

<p>Provide your evidence of national clinical impact for each of the 5 domains. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>domain 1: delivering and developing a high-quality service</li>
  <li>domain 2: leadership&nbsp;</li>
  <li>domain 3: education, training and people development&nbsp;</li>
  <li>domain 4: innovation and research – this should include up to 10 of your most significant publications, whether web-based or multi-media outputs, and up to 5 reviews and textbooks&nbsp;</li>
  <li>domain 5: additional national impact –&nbsp;here, tell us about high-quality work with nationally or internationally recognised impact that has a direct benefit to the NHS&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>All evidence must be clearly dated. You can find more detail on what a good submission for each domain looks like and some helpful examples in part 5 of the main guidance.</p>

<h4>Step 9: ratings and inspections</h4>

<p>We need to know if your employer has been inspected by either the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England or Health Education and Improvement Wales (HEIW) in Wales, and if so, the date of the inspection, the rating and your role in the ratings and any improvement plans.</p>

<p>If they have not been inspected or have been rated differently, tell us the details.</p>

<p>You will need to confirm that the information you have is provided is accurate to the best of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Step 10: submit your application for review by your employer</h4>

<p>Click ‘Submit’ in the bottom right corner to send your application to your employer. If you work for a university, this should be the nominated person at the trust where you hold an honorary contract that you named in step 1.</p>

<p>Your employer will be asked to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if your application is supported or not supported – if it is not supported, they will be asked to explain why&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that you are working to professional and personal conduct standards&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that you have had a formal appraisal in the last 12 months, agreed a job plan, fulfilled your contractual obligations, and complied with the Private Practice Code of Conduct&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they are aware of any disciplinary or professional proceedings or investigations inside or outside the trust – if so what they are&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They will also be asked to provide a citation commenting on the merits of your application and your work towards meeting the trust’s objectives&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your employer feels there should be any changes before they complete their section, they can return your application to you. If they do this you will receive notes explaining their reasoning.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Step 11: review your employer’s section</h4>

<p>Once your employer has completed their section they will send your application back to you to review. If you feel your employer’s section needs amending, discuss any proposed changes with them and contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 12: submit your application</h4>

<p>When all sections, including the employer section, are complete, you are ready to submit your application. After you submit it you cannot change it so please check that you only have one request for support from an <abbr title="national nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>. You will not be able to submit your application if you have more than one, so you will need to reject one to continue.</p>

<p>If you find that you need to change something after it’s submitted, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 13: after submission</h4>

<p>Once your application is submitted, it will move from ‘In Progress’ to ‘Submitted’ on the landing page when you log into your account again.</p>

<h3>Key dates</h3>

<p>The timetable for the 2022 national awards round is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>27 April to 22 June 2022 – applications open</li>
  <li>27 June to 4 September 2022 – scoring&nbsp;</li>
  <li>8 September to 9 October 2022 – <abbr title="national 3">N3</abbr> scoring&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>12 September to 25 November 2022 – governance review&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

  <li>February 2023 – appeals window opens</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 3: how your application is scored</h2>

<p>It is important that you read the guidance and look at the examples for each domain as your submission for each of them is allocated a score:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 = your application is excellent with clear national impact</li>
  <li>6 = your work is over and above your contract terms with some regional impact</li>
  <li>2 = you’ve met the terms of your contract or mostly within your local area</li>
  <li>0 = you have not met the terms of your contract or there’s not enough information to make a judgement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things to do when you apply</h3>

<p>When you fill in your application form, follow the steps in this guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure all evidence is dated and explain if any activity is still ongoing</li>
  <li>give clear dates for your achievements – focus on evidence from the last 5 years, what you have achieved since any prior award and how your work has progressed since gaining it</li>
  <li>make your content specific to the criteria for the relevant domain</li>
  <li>include compelling evidence of what you achieved and how you personally contributed</li>
  <li>demonstrate the outcome and results of the changes you implemented</li>
  <li>explain the wider impact on your patients, colleagues or the NHS</li>
  <li>state measurable information – such as outcome data, quote dates, source and relevant benchmarks</li>
  <li>make sure that the national or international impact your work has achieved is clear</li>
  <li>use a new line for each entry and bullet points to make information clearer and easier to read</li>
  <li>highlight the most important examples of your work focusing on its national and international impacts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things to avoid doing when you apply</h3>

<p>When you fill in your application form, make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not repeat content across the different domains unless it has a specific relevance – if so, draw this out</li>
  <li>do not only describe your role or what you did – you need to show how it made a difference</li>
  <li>do not use undefined acronyms that those assessing your application may not know</li>
  <li>do not repeat information from old applications – assessors compare new and previous applications and will check for repeated information, which could affect your score</li>
</ul>

<h3>Check your application form</h3>

<p>Before you submit your application, make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include solid evidence with dates and outcomes that show how you made services more efficient and productive, better for patients, colleagues or the NHS</li>
  <li>demonstrate how what you delivered improved the quality of patient care through your role as an enabler and leader of:
    <ul>
      <li>health provision</li>
      <li>prevention</li>
      <li>policy development and implementation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>give a clear chronology of dates and list any sources</li>
  <li>include validated data or reports</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 4: other things you need to know</h2>

<p>There are some useful links to help you as you consider what to include in your application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for extra support with things such as language, additional time or mentoring – please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>we will be uploading successful personal statements from previous award winners shortly so you can see what has been successful in the past – you can review the main guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a>
</li>
  <li>a list of key contacts will be uploaded on our home page shortly</li>
</ul>

<p>See the main guidance for more detail on the topics set out below – check if they apply to you.</p>

<p>The transitional arrangements will be in place over the next 5 years – see ‘Changes to the application and scoring processes’ and part 1 of the main guidance on how they affect new applications and if you already have a national CEA award.</p>

<p>The transitional arrangements are only applicable to applicants in England. In Wales there are no transitional arrangements, however, award holders may still be eligible for pension protection and should contact their employer in the first instance for further information.</p>

<p>You need to tell us before you apply if you are partially retired or planning to retire, and how getting an award affects your pension – for more information see ‘Retirement: things you need to let us know’ of the main guidance.</p>

<p>If your circumstances change during the application process, or after you have attained an award, see part 8 of the main guidance for things you must tell us – this includes changes in your employment and all types of leave such as a sabbatical, secondment, maternity or paternity leave, other unpaid leave or starting to take any of your pension.</p>

<p>If you don’t think the assessment process has been done fairly, see part 6 of the main guidance for the appeals process – this section also covers how to complain to the ombudsman.</p>

<p>If there any investigations, disciplinary procedures or legal action against you, the things you must tell us are set out in part 2 and part 3 of the main guidance.</p>

<p>If we find any evidence of a false statement or fraud, we will take appropriate action – for more information see part 9 of the main guidance.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a new award – see part 4 of the main guidance on how to start a new application when the 5-year period is ending.</p>
