<h2>About this guide</h2>

<p>This guide is for national nominating organisations (<abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>) who wish to support an application for a new national Clinical Impact Award (<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr>) with a ranking and citation. It covers the 2022 national Clinical Excellence Awards (<abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>) competition in England and Wales and tells you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the changes made to simplify and improve the award scheme for 2022</li>
  <li>your role in the process as a national nominating organisation <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>
</li>
  <li>how awards are assessed</li>
</ul>

<p>Use this background information as a reference guide when supporting an application. You should find everything you need to help you on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards">home page</a> – if you have any questions that are not covered, you can contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>All citations and ranked lists must be submitted by 5pm on 22 June 2022.</p>

<h2>Changes to the application and scoring processes</h2>

<p>Following the 2021 consultation on reform of the national Clinical Excellence Awards, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and Welsh Government have agreed the following changes will be implemented in a revised scheme as the National Clinical Impact Awards. See the full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a> for further detail on the reforms.</p>

<h3>Summary of the changes</h3>

<h4>Increase the number of available awards</h4>

<p>Once the transition process for existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> award holders has been completed over the 5-year transitional period, there will be up to 600 awards granted annually in England. National awards and local awards are also planned to be held concurrently – this is being reviewed throughout the transition period.</p>

<h4>Rebrand the scheme</h4>

<p>The awards have been rebranded as the national Clinical Impact Awards to reflect to applicants and scorers that the primary focus of the awards is the output of activities, rather than undertaking activities in the absence of describing their impact and results.</p>

<h4>Restructure the award levels</h4>

<p>In England, the scheme now operates as a 3-level award system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>national 1 (lowest)</li>
  <li>national 2&nbsp;</li>
  <li>national 3 (highest)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Refresh the assessment domains</h4>

<p>The assessment domains have been revised to combine both ‘delivering and developing service’ into a single new domain (domain 1). Three domains (domains 2, 3 and 4) have been renumbered and their emphases amended, and a new fifth domain has been introduced to allow applicants to include evidence of national impact from other unpaid activities, or where they have delivered impact over and above expectations.</p>

<h4>Simplify the application process</h4>

<p>A single-level application process has been introduced so applicants no longer apply for an award at a specific level. This enables applicants to gain higher level awards on first application based on the score they attain.</p>

<h4>Remove pro-rated awards</h4>

<p>Those working less than full time (<abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr>) will no longer have their post 2022 award payments pro-rated.</p>

<h4>Remove the renewals process</h4>

<p>The renewals process has been removed. National Clinical Impact Awards will be held for a total of 5 years, at which point applicants need to reapply.</p>

<h4>Remove the pensionability of awards</h4>

<p>National Clinical Impact Awards are no longer pensionable or consolidated.</p>

<h4>Simplify the process for employers</h4>

<p>Employers only need to indicate their support or their lack of support for an application and provide a citation for each applicant. Employer scoring and ranking are no longer required. Further information about employer citations is included in Part 5 of the employers’ guide, which you can access via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Differences for those based in Wales</h3>

<p>In Wales, all of the above changes apply except for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of awards – proportionate to the size of the consultant workforce and the level of commitment awards successful applicants in Wales will hold, there will be up to 37 awards granted per year once the transition process has completed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the structure of awards levels – the scheme will continue with 4 levels: level 0, level 1, level 2 and level 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>concurrent awards – consultants will be able to access both commitment awards and hold a national Clinical Impact Award at the same time from 2022 onwards</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Streamlined our process to make applying for an award simpler</h3>

<p>We have removed the additional forms for evidence and increased the character limit on the main form to 2,000 characters for all domains. Applicants only need to submit one form for scoring. We have adapted the references section in the new ‘domain 3: innovation and research’ to remove any character limit.</p>

<p>We have reduced the list of accredited national nominating bodies and specialist societies to reduce duplication within and across specialties. All accredited ranking organisations will now be known as national nominating organisations (<abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>), amending and rebalancing the number of ranking places available to each specialty, in proportion to the number of eligible consultants. Each applicant can now only have one ranking and citation from one relevant <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>.</p>

<p>We have removed the option to seek third-party citations. Citations are only possible from the list of <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> for those applicants ranked by them in their prioritisation exercises.</p>

<p>We will evaluate the number of applications to be scored in each region and continue to adjust scoring groups and numbers across regions to balance the workload and optimise committee diversity. This will ensure enough scorers are available to assess each application.</p>

<p>Regional sub-committee scoring will continue with each region being given an indicative number of awards at each level (N1/N2/N3) to retain the equity of regional opportunity for success. This continues to be based on the number of awards available nationally and the number of applications received. Applications tied at the cut off for the lower limit of N1, or tied between N1 and N2, will be rescored by the National Reserve Sub-committee (<abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>), as will any applications identified through national governance review.</p>

<p>To decide which applicants gain an N3 award, each region’s highest scoring applicants constituting twice their N3 indicative number will be pooled nationally and rescored by the N3 Committee, to determine those most deserving of the highest-level national award. Those who are unsuccessful at N3 will be recommended for an N2 award.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The transitional arrangements are only applicable to applicants in England. In Wales there are no transitional arrangements, however, award holders may still be eligible for pension protection and should contact their Trust in the first instance for further information.</p>
</div>

<p>In 2018, the government approved schedule 30 of the 2003 consultant contract which was negotiated and agreed between NHS Employers and the British Medical Association (BMA). This provides transitional pay protection where a new national scheme has lower award values. This protection is costly – peaking at over £30 million in 2025 to 2026. As the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> scheme must stay within the agreed budget, pay protection has an impact on the funding available for new awards in the transitional period. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/articles/local-clinical-excellence-award-lcea-arrangements" rel="external">Details of pay protection arrangements for existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders applying for and successfully gaining their first <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr></a> can be found in schedule 30.</p>

<p>The cost of pay protection means we have altered some elements of the scheme for the transitional period. These elements will be reviewed periodically, and any necessary adjustments will be made each year. For example, local awards and national awards cannot be held at the same time at the moment, and the numbers of <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> made available at each level may vary during the transition period.</p>

<h3>Overview of changes to the process for <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>We have rationalised the number of <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> to reduce the number of rankings and citations produced, to improve their value as a potential differentiator for applicants who make the most notable national impact.</p>

<p>This increases the value of the citation and ranking, as previously we have received over 1,700 rankings for 300 awards which did not provide differentiation.</p>

<p>To qualify as an accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>, each organisation must confirm their processes adhere to expectations for equality, diversity and inclusivity for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their wider membership</li>
  <li>membership of panels undertaking scoring and ranking</li>
  <li>the ranking processes to select those applicants for ranking places and citations</li>
</ul>

<p>We have limited each applicant to one <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> ranking and citation to improve the equity of availability of rankings, and to balance rankings across individual applicants.</p>

<p>Applicants can choose up to 2 <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> to request a ranking and citation. This will be logged into the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system to send the draft application to those <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>. Both <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> will be aware of the other <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> selected. Applicants who work in smaller subspecialties without a specifically accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> are expected to be able to seek support from a broader ‘umbrella’ <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> – such as a royal college from which they have a professional qualification or a related society.</p>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> expects that membership of a society or college should not be a pre-requisite to seeking a ranking and citation.</p>

<p>Best practice guidance for <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> is included in this guide to encourage adherence to workable and consistent timescales to produce ranking lists. This will allow applicants to select which <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> they wish to be supported by and log this into the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system. This will be before any citations are produced and will ‘lock out’ the other <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>, reducing unnecessary work.</p>

<p>As only one <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> can ultimately be selected by the applicant, if support from both is offered, the <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> will be able to re-rank their lists excluding any who choose not to accept their support before working on citations.</p>

<p>The total number of ranking places for <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> has been reduced. Each specialty or major subspecialty has been allocated a number of places in direct proportion to the number of eligible consultants as recorded in NHS Digital workforce statistics. Where there is more than one accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> per specialty, the number of places will be divided between them and allocated in proportion to the historical proportions each <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> received in the <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> system.</p>

<p>A small number of national non-specialist representative bodies have a number of places allocated to provide rankings and citations. These will also conform to the same requirements of specialist <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>. Should support from one of these <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> be requested, this will be considered as one of the 2 <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> allowed to be selected for consideration. As above, applicants can have support from only one <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> regardless of whether it is from a specialist group or not.</p>

<p>Rankings and citations from some of these national bodies, for example the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (<abbr title="Academy of Medical Royal Colleges">AoMRC</abbr>) and Universities UK (<abbr title="Universities UK">UUK</abbr>), may be perceived as being of special merit in supporting the attainment of a higher level national 3 (N3) award. However, the process of evaluation, scoring and ranking by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> sub-committees is identical, regardless of whether a non-specialist or specialist ranking is present, as is the case where no ranking or citation is present on the application. All applications are assessed in the same way and scored only on the evidence within the 5 domains. Citations and rankings are solely for triangulation and corroboration of evidence and are not in themselves scored.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>, their performance and allocated number of ranking spaces will be kept under review.</p>

<h2>Part 1: introduction</h2>

<h3>About <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> and the Clinical Impact Awards scheme</h3>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>) runs the national Clinical Impact Awards scheme for the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) in England.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The advisory committee also provides governance for the awards for the Welsh Government in Wales.</p>
</div>

<p>Health ministers agree a limited number of new awards each year, so the selection process is very competitive.</p>

<p>A consultant can apply for a new award at any time after completing a full year in an eligible role. If a consultant already holds a national Clinical Excellence Award, transitional arrangements apply between the old and new schemes. To be considered, the applicant will need to show that what has been delivered has had an impact at a national level, and over and above the expectations defined in their job plan in developing and delivering a high-quality service.</p>

<p>There will also be a need to demonstrate a commitment to, and nationally relevant impact on improving the NHS through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leadership</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>training</li>
  <li>people development</li>
  <li>innovation and research</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also an opportunity to provide evidence of national impact in areas that are not captured in the 4 domains, particularly if it relates to published NHS or other relevant health objectives. In all of the domains, applicants should consider providing evidence of national impact relating to equality, diversity and inclusion.</p>

<p>There is one online application form for all awards, so every applicant can highlight their contributions in the same way.</p>

<p>Based on the strength of applications, our regional sub-committees, N3 committee and our main committee will recommend applicants for national awards to health ministers for them to approve.</p>

<h3>How national awards relate to local awards</h3>

<p>The aim for the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> scheme is to allow local and national awards to be held concurrently – due to the costs of the transitional pay protection explained above, this is not possible straightaway. In 2022 they are not being held at the same time. Further information about local awards can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/" rel="external">NHS Employers website</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, employers give commitment awards. You can find more information about these in the amended <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/Documents/433/Nat_Consultant_Contract.pdf" rel="external">National Consultant Contract in Wales 2003</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>National awards are awarded by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>. They recognise the national impact of work undertaken over and above contractual or other paid activities in the NHS (in England and Wales). They specifically recognise the dissemination and implementation of that work and its impact on the wider NHS and on public health. There is no requirement to hold any local award to be eligible to apply for a national award.</p>

<p>There are 3 levels of national awards in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>national level 1 (N1)</li>
  <li>national level 2 (N2)</li>
  <li>national level 3 (N3)</li>
</ul>

<p>N3 is the highest award.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Four award levels are available in Wales, with N0 being added as a lowest level to account for a Welsh-only level that differs from that in England.</p>
</div>

<h3>What the national scheme rewards</h3>

<p>The scheme rewards consultants or academic GPs who deliver national impact above the expectations of their job role or other paid work. The job plan forms an important benchmark based on the number of programmed activities (<abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>) worked. We pay careful attention to applications where a consultant’s circumstances and job plan have changed. </p>

<p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to be precise about the timing of any changes in working patterns and periods of absence – perhaps due to maternity leave or ill health. In such cases, it is reasonable to take into account work done over a more prolonged time period when assessing the application.</p>

<p>Applicants need to give evidence of impact across the following 5 domains:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delivering and developing a high-quality service</li>
  <li>Leadership</li>
  <li>Education, training and people development</li>
  <li>Innovation and research</li>
  <li>Other areas of national impact, with specific reference to NHS priorities where relevant</li>
</ol>

<p>These 5 domains are explained below in Part 3 of this guide.</p>

<p>We do not give awards for standalone overseas work. Work in other countries are not directly relevant for an award so we cannot consider it on its own, but if an applicant can show evidence that overseas work has helped the NHS and the health of the public directly, or has had a direct reputational benefit for the NHS overseas, it may be supported.</p>

<h3>How we assess applications</h3>

<p>We run the scheme fairly and openly offering every applicant an equal opportunity, and we consider all applications on merit. We include our analysis of each year’s competition in our annual report.</p>

<p>We assess all applications against the same criteria which you can find below in Part 3 of this guide.</p>

<p>Our sub-committees are regional groups that assess applications for national awards for most applicants in their area. Based on application workload, and to provide balance and a degree of external scrutiny across these committees, we reallocate some sub-committee members to score in other regions. For more information see the applicants’ guide on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a>.</p>

<p>There are 13 regional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards/about/our-governance"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> sub-committees</a> in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cheshire and Mersey</li>
  <li>East of England</li>
  <li>East Midlands</li>
  <li>London North East</li>
  <li>London North West</li>
  <li>London South</li>
  <li>North East</li>
  <li>North West</li>
  <li>South</li>
  <li>South East</li>
  <li>South West</li>
  <li>West Midlands</li>
  <li>Yorkshire and Humber</li>
</ul>

<p>There are separate sub-committees for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and arm’s length bodies (<abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>assessing the highest-scoring regional applicants for N3 awards – <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Wales has its own sub-committees.</p>
</div>

<p>The sub-committees consider all applications in their area except for those from public health consultants and academic GPs contracted by Public Health England and NHS England. These are assessed by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or arm’s length body (<abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>) sub-committee where they can be benchmarked more easily. Each regional sub-committee is allocated an indicative number of awards at each level. This is based on the number of national awards available, proportionately distributed based on the number of applications received that year in each region. This means there is an equal chance of achieving an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> in any region.</p>

<p>Sub-committee members come from a range of backgrounds with experience and expertise in many different areas. They assess and score applications independently. All the individual scores for an application are averaged and then ranked against the other applications in that region. The top scoring applications in each region are provisionally allocated an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr>. To ensure the highest level awards are granted to those making the greatest national impact, a separate N3 sub-committee will rescore all those from each region falling within the N3 indicative allocation, plus the same number of applicants scoring highest in the N2 allocation. This rescoring provides a national benchmarking for determining who receives an N3 award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each sub-committee is typically made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>medical and dental professionals – 50%</li>
  <li>non-medical professionals and lay members – 25%</li>
  <li>employers – 25%</li>
</ul>

<p>Each sub-committee is normally divided into scoring groups to manage the workload. We ensure there is equivalent diversity of scorers across these groups. These groups score a randomly selected group of applications to minimise any unconscious bias affecting the scoring.</p>

<p>Each group scores applications consistently against the guidance. We expect there to be up to 600 new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> available each year in England – subject to ministerial agreement and funding impacts during the transitional period. Our ambition is to award 330 x N1, 200 x N2 and 70 x N3 awards each year at a value of £20,000, £30,000, and £40,000 respectively.</p>

<p>When an application for an award is successful, the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> will last 5 years backdated to 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>After regional sub-committee scoring has closed and the ranked list has been produced, our chair and medical director review all the provisionally successful N1 and N2 applications that are not being considered for an N3 award. After their review, applications where questions arise or clarification may be helpful are discussed at the regional sub-committee meetings as part of our quality and governance review.</p>

<p>Applications that are tied at the cut-off point for N1 or between N1 and N2 awards are automatically referred for rescoring by <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>.</p>

<p>Applications where questions have not been resolved are also referred to <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> for rescoring. <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> is made up of the chairs and medical vice-chairs of the regional sub-committees and other experienced scorers from the regions. As a panel of our most experienced scorers, <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> acts as a quality assurance mechanism. Our chair and medical director recommend applications for awards to our main committee based on the sub-committee and <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> scores.</p>

<p>Following scrutiny from our main committee, English recommendations go to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers.</p>

<p>If an award is approved, we will let the applicant and their employer know. Unsuccessful applicants will be informed at the same time.</p>

<h3>Local awards and commitment awards</h3>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> does not have any say in local awards in England or commitment awards in Wales.</p>

<h3>Running an open, transparent scheme</h3>

<p>More information about <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> and the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> scheme can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> home page</a>, with further guidance to be available shortly, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a list of all national award holders</li>
  <li>personal statements from people who have received a new award</li>
  <li>the members of our main committee and our sub-committees</li>
  <li>a list of national nominating organisations</li>
  <li>a guide for applicants – with a supporting ‘quick guide’</li>
  <li>a guide for assessors on how to assess and score applications</li>
  <li>annual reports about each awards round</li>
  <li>summaries of the minutes for the main committee’s meetings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disability</h3>

<p>In line with the Equality Act 2010, employers must consider making reasonable adjustments for employees with disabilities. These are changes to things such as equipment or processes to make sure people with disabilities can do their job.</p>

<p>If an applicant has a disability, where relevant, any reasonable adjustments they have agreed with you should be explained in the job plan section of the application form. You may add explanations about any disabilities or other relevant aspects in your comments.</p>

<p>We treat all applications equally and use the same scoring criteria for everyone.</p>

<h3>Extenuating circumstances</h3>

<p>If there are extenuating circumstances that an applicant feels may affect their ability to submit a successful application, we would like them to let us know as soon as possible before the application closing date, so we can provide support and make sure the application is considered fairly. We cannot take any extenuating circumstances into account after the application form has been submitted and it has been scored.</p>

<p>Each case is treated on its own merits, and the outcomes from each one are based on the rules relating to the current scheme. If a consultant applies for an award and believes there are extenuating circumstances, these can be described in the job plan, personal statement and/or the relevant domains of the application form.</p>

<p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to be precise about the timing of any such changes in working patterns, and to provide dates for the achievements that they are presenting for assessment. For example, an applicant may describe periods of absence due to maternity leave or ill-health during the relevant 5-year period.</p>

<p>We understand that it can be difficult for applicants to share personal information. As <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> we expect you to treat any such information with respect and in confidence.</p>

<h3>Accredited national nomination organisations</h3>

<p>As part of the scoring process, our assessors consider the views of accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> through ranked lists and citations – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-impact-awards-scheme-register-of-national-nominating-organisations">the list of accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>All citations and ranked lists for national awards must be submitted by 5pm on 22 June 2022.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements for people with existing national Clinical Excellence Awards</h3>

<p>With the introduction of a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> scheme from 2022, existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders are subject to prior <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> rules for their awards and tenure. There is a transitional period based on previously agreed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/articles/local-clinical-excellence-award-lcea-arrangements" rel="external">schedule 30 arrangements</a> for <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders applying for a first new award.</p>

<p>Rules that apply to existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders:</p>

<p>If an application is made for a first new award before an existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> would have been due for renewal under the old scheme and are unsuccessful, the individual keeps their existing <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> until its expiry. They may apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> again up to the year before the <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>’s expiry. If a <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> would have been due for renewal and the application is unsuccessful, the reversion arrangements to receive a legacy, pensionable local <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> will continue to apply – the level of the local award depends on the score obtained in the new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> application.</p>

<p>If a consultant applies in the year their national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> expires, this <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> will lapse before the annual <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> award round is completed and the applicant will not be eligible for the transition arrangements.</p>

<p>If an applicant successfully gains a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> before their existing NCEA expires, the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> will start when the NCEA expires. The value of legacy <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Awards">CEAs</abbr> and its pensionable benefits are protected for the duration of the first new award at an equivalent level. If an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> is gained at an equivalent or higher level to their national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>, the payment received will be no less than the value of their existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>. If an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> is gained at a lower equivalent level, the applicant will receive no less than the legacy national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> payment at that level. There will be an obligation in this case to accept the new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> and give up any unexpired NCEA – local awards cannot be held simultaneously with <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> awards that benefit from schedule 30 protection.</p>

<p>The equivalent levels are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>N1 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to silver <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>N2 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to gold <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>N3 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to platinum <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> award holders who enter the transitional arrangements will not currently be eligible for local <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> payments.</p>

<p>Initially, due to the cost of the transitional arrangements, <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> holders are not eligible for local awards in England at the same time whether or not they held a prior national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>. This will be reviewed during and after the transition period to see when national and local awards can be held concurrently. You can read more information about this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">response to the consultation</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 2: your role as an national nominating organisation</h2>

<h3>Making a citation or nomination</h3>

<h4>Who can provide a citation</h4>

<p>Citations must be submitted through the online system. Accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> submit them alongside a ranked list via their account. We will email you to instruct you on how you can confirm that you ensure a fair and diverse representation of your members and non-members from your specialty, who can seek and access support for <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> applications and that your processes do not disadvantage any groups, particularly those who may have protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Citations can only be provided by accredited <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> for the applicants that succeed in gaining one of their allocated rankings and who have confirmed their acceptance of it in the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system.</p>

<p>A completed citation must identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the person completing the citation, as well as the body that they represent</li>
  <li>a senior officer of the society who vouches for the institution’s approval of that citation</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who can nominate</h4>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> has designated a small number of national organisations as accredited national nominating organisations. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-impact-awards-scheme-register-of-national-nominating-organisations">The list of <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr></a> submit ranked lists, assessing the relative excellence of new applications that have been linked to their <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> by the applicant. The number for any specialty is determined by the proportion of eligible consultants in their specialty in the NHS and is divided between the <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> in that specialty.</p>

<p>Accredited national nominating organisations should submit nominations for new awards in ranked order.</p>

<p>A ranked list can only be submitted to <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> with a corresponding citation for each applicant. Rankings and citations are considered by scorers to validate and contextualise the evidence presented in the associated application. Citations are not scored and can only validate the evidence in the 5 domains. They cannot and should not be seen as a means to compensate for poor quality evidence in domains.</p>

<p>The process used should be publicised to all your members and the wider specialty in sufficient time to allow applicants to prepare applications and should provide for self-nomination to your <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> that links to the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system. You should ensure that your members and the wider specialty are aware of processes for determining your ranked list.</p>

<p>As applicants are only permitted to have one <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> ranking but may apply to 2 <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> for consideration, once an <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> decides to provide a ranking to an applicant, the applicant may accept this. This will ‘lock out’ the second <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> if they have requested a ranking from them. In this case if a potential ranking place from the second <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> has been allocated, it will not be permitted. If an applicant receives 2 <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> rankings and citations in the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system, they will not be able to submit their application until one of these is rejected.</p>

<p>To avoid losing the ranking space, the second <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> may then choose to promote any initially lower ranking applicants, such as from a reserve list, into the ranking places. The <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> will not lose a ranking place as long as these are submitted within the time periods for the award round, but sequencing of applications to <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> and the timing of approval processes will be critical to ensure fairness and to avoid duplication of effort.</p>

<p>To facilitate potential reranking, <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> may wish to prioritise their ranking lists and align the timing of their processes with other <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr>. You must not however collude on applicants, applications or ranking decisions. All <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> must consider applications independently.</p>

<p>Although rankings and citations from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (<abbr title="Academy of Medical Royal Colleges">AoMRC</abbr>) and Universities UK (<abbr title="Universities UK">UUK</abbr>), should they choose to make rankings, may be seen of special merit for those applicants, potentially seen as being worthy of an N3 award. The <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> and regional assessment process is the same. If these <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> are providing rankings, they may wish to be clear in setting their parameters for the nature of applicants and their evidence that they will support. This must conform to equality, diversity and inclusivity standards and will manage the expectations for those applicants who may seek their support.</p>

<h3>Good practice</h3>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> recommends (but cannot mandate) the following practice guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set a fixed deadline – for example, 4 weeks after the round opens to decide (before canvassing citations) to whom you will offer definite support (‘A’ list), indicate that an applicant is on their reserve (‘B’ list) or will not get support</li>
  <li>candidates should be informed and will have a short period to accept or reject the offer</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> can then finalise their ‘A’ lists, promoting from the ‘B’ list if necessary and arrange citations. Should <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> have vacant ranking spaces thereafter, later allocations could be utilised from others who have already applied to the <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> but may not have been listed on the ‘A’ or ‘B’ list, if <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> wish to do so. These must be logged on the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system before the closing date</li>
</ul>

<p>The above are suggestions and recommendations only. <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> will remain responsible for their own processes and need to decide how best to manage them. In all cases however, <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> are expected to act transparently.</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>All <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> must operate open, objective and transparent systems for consideration of applicants. It is good practice to involve consultants with and without a national award and lay representatives.</p>

<p>In addition to their rankings and citations, we will ask accredited national nominating organisations to provide the number of members who applied for support in 2022 and their total membership number, as well as any diversity statistics held. We will also request a brief statement confirming what processes are in place to assure equality and diversity in deciding who should achieve ranking, as well as assurance that overall membership reflects the diversity of the specialty.</p>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> will produce diversity statistics for applicants and those who are successful in gaining an award by specialty. This will be compared to NHS Digital diversity data wherever possible and reported upon.</p>

<h3>Assessing an application</h3>

<p>You should concentrate your evaluation on contributions to the specialty or appropriate grouping and specifically the national impact on the wider NHS. You should not support those who have made solely local contributions. You are also discouraged from supporting applicants who have worked on behalf of your membership organisation unless these and their other activities have led to directly demonstrable national benefits for the NHS.</p>

<p>Part 3 of this guide outlines the criteria that will be used for assessing the application, and you should refer to these when considering applications. You may also wish to use the advice on scoring that <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> provides for its sub-committees in the assessors’ guide which will be available shortly.</p>

<p>You should rank all applications collectively. Applications are made for a national award. The level of the award granted is determined by the scores attained in subcommittee scoring.</p>

<h3>Retirement</h3>

<p>If applicants retire during an awards round, and before we announce the results, we will consider applications withdrawn.</p>

<p>National <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Awards">CEAs</abbr> are consolidated with pensions, which means it is taken into account when pensions are calculated. These awards stop when applicants retire or claim their pension. If applicants return to work on a permanent NHS consultant contract – retaining or regaining full registration with a licence to practise – they can reapply for a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are not consolidated with pensions. If applicants retire in receipt of an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr>, their award will cease as they are no longer eligible. If applicants retire in receipt of an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> that is not subject to any transitional national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> arrangements and return to work without a gap between the employment contracts, we may shorten the period before the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> expires.</p>

<p>If clinicians apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIA</abbr> when they come back to work or after a seamless retire and return as above, <abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> can only consider and rank evidence on achievements since the new contract started. We will not consider evidence used for a prior award, from before the new contract date or evidence that is not clearly dated. Citations must reflect this time period. If applicants are continuing the work they were doing before they retired, they must make it clear what has been achieved since the start of their new contract.</p>

<h3>Submitting a ranked list via the online system</h3>

<p>You should submit a ranked list for your supported applicants via the online system through the steps set out below.</p>

<h4>Step 1: logging into the system</h4>

<p>You will need to log in to access the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application system – details of how to do this will be sent you in advance of the award round opening. If you do not have an account, email us leaving a contact telephone number.</p>

<h4>Step 2: review the list of applicants requesting support</h4>

<p>Once logged in, you will see the list of applicants who have started an application and requested support from your organisation as part of it. <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> will have confirmed how many applicants you can support – if you’re unsure then email us, but you may see more requests in your list. You must follow your own process to determine which applicants to support.</p>

<h4>Step 3: write citations and confirm ranking place</h4>

<p>When you have determined which applicants to support, find them in the list of requests and enter the citation. The ‘quick edit’ button next to an applicant’s name will allow you to enter the ranked position you gave.</p>

<h4>Step 4: submit your information</h4>

<p>Once you have completed your citations and ranking information, you can submit your information. In doing so, you confirm that you agree to the statements regarding representation and equality. Should you need to amend your information after submitting, email <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>All ranked lists and supporting citations must be submitted by 22 June 2022 – we will not accept late submissions.</p>

<h4>Step 5: monitor any cancellations of support requests</h4>

<p>Applicants can only apply with one request for support from an <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>, but they can initially list 2. It will be possible for applicants for whom you’ve provided a citation to cancel their request in favour of support from another <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr>, but our guidance is clear that this is not allowed as it potentially wastes limited nominating places that could be otherwise used. If you become aware of any applicants who cancel your support after a citation has been provided, you should inform <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Part 3: how applications are scored</h2>

<h3>Evidence of how an applicant’s work has positively impacted the NHS in England or Wales</h3>

<p>Clinical impact is about providing high quality services to patients that go beyond the applicant’s immediate remit that improves clinical outcomes for as many patients as possible, use resources efficiently and make national services more productive.</p>

<p>Applicants need to show assessors evidence of how they made these services more efficient and productive, and improved quality at the same time, as well as demonstrating their role as an enabler and leader of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health provision</li>
  <li>prevention and policy development</li>
  <li>implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National nominating organisations">NNOs</abbr> and assessors need to be sure all achievements are relevant and need to know when they occurred, or if these activities are continuing or stopped. It is essential that the dates of achievements are clear, as without dates they cannot be scored highly.</p>

<p>Applicants do not need to show they have achieved over-and-above expected standards in all 5 domains – a lot will depend on the type and nature of their post and job role. Excellent local or regional contributions can score well if they have been disseminated and had an impact on the wider NHS. This is especially true when there are direct national and international impacts.</p>

<p>Our assessors score the domain sections according to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 = an application is excellent with clear and sustained national and or international impact</li>
  <li>6 = the work is over-and-above contract terms and has at least a regional impact beyond the local area</li>
  <li>2 = the applicant has met the terms of their contract or may have contributed more, mainly within their locality</li>
  <li>0 = the applicant has not met the terms of their contract or there is not enough information to make a judgement</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 5 domains – achievements should be grouped in line with each one and must avoid repetition across domains unless the evidence shows different aspects of work that is relevant to the domain. In all cases, it is important to ensure dates are included, otherwise you should not consider the evidence sufficiently strong to support.</p>

<p>We recognise the extraordinary requirements of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the work that many consultants and academic GPs (including other healthcare workers) contributed. Applicants may choose to include evidence related to this as part of evidence over prior years. In this case, as with all other evidence, concentrate on the impact of the contributions over-and-above their expected role, mainly where it has had an impact outside of their immediate remit.</p>

<p>We recognise how important redeployment, extended hours and remits have been in COVID-19 and that these are broadly universal across the NHS. Recognition may also be given for efforts made to maintain other key clinical services, research activities and teaching and training during the pandemic period. Such local work related to COVID-19, while essential, should mainly be scored well where applicants have demonstrated how it has had broad and ideally national impact. Remember also to consider their other work across the entire 5-year period in each domain as important evidence of other sustained impact.</p>

<p>The below are some possible examples of evidence.</p>

<h4>Domain 1: delivering and developing a high-quality service</h4>

<p>In this section, applicants should include evidence of what has been achieved in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>providing and developing a safe service with measurable, effective clinical outcomes based on delivery of high technical and clinical standards of service that provides a good experience for patients, and how it has been cascaded more widely to colleagues who have implemented improvements based on this experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consistently looking for and introducing ways to improve their service – sharing the learning and seeing it embedded in practice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants should explain which activities relate to clinical services where they are paid by the NHS, and to other aspects of their work as a consultant.</p>

<p>Applicants should include quantified measures such as outcome data. These need to reflect the whole service of the multi-professional team provide and how they have collectively disseminated their experience. Applicants should use validated indicators for quality improvement or quality standards and other reference data sources in England or the healthcare standards for Wales – ideally providing performance data against benchmark or national indicators for their specialty showing local and wider improvements as a result of their work.</p>

<p>For good patient experience, applicants should show how they have ensured patients are cared for with compassion, integrity and dignity and how they have demonstrated commitment to patient safety and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Evidence could show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>excellent standards for dealing with patients, relatives, and staff. Surveys or collated 360-degree feedback to validate evidence of patients’ quality care, and how they communicated it to colleagues</li>
  <li>excellent work in preventative medicine and public health, for example, in alcohol abuse, vaccination programmes, stopping smoking and preventing injury and where this work has been further developed outside their immediate remit</li>
  <li>use of wider NHS resources effectively improving their efficiencies</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“In an analysis of mixed arterial interventions (20xx), our vascular unit had relative risk of death 0.61 in the UK and the third largest arterial series in the country. We have benchmarked these data and the specific factors that have led to improvements so that others can benefit from our experience. My contribution to this outcome was…”</p>

<p>“Data from the intensive care national audit (<abbr title="intensive care national audit">ICNARC</abbr>) (May 20xx), shows our unit is one of the top 10 for survival with a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 0.65, meaning 60 patients lived who were expected to die. This performance has improved steadily since 20xx when our SMR was 1.35. In sharing this with <abbr title="intensive care national audit">ICNARC</abbr> we established the predominant factors for survival and share best practice to improve outcomes more widely. My contribution to this outcome was…”</p>

<p>“I have set up a short stay programme which has the lowest length of stay for hip replacements in England – 2.7 days as against the England average of 6.1 days… 67% of patients are home after 2 nights… 98.5% patient satisfaction service… readmission rate of 5.1% as compared to the regional average of 7%. This has been communicated in xx forums and adopted as best practice standards by xx body.”</p>

<p>Applicants should include national or regional benchmark comparisons wherever possible. For example, standard mortality ratios, peri-operative complication rates, MRSA, C. difficile rates, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, or length of stay data.</p>

<p>Applicants should show how they have significantly improved the clinical effectiveness of local services and either improved services elsewhere or used that experience to enable others to do so. Similarly, this experience may be translatable to other clinical services in the wider NHS in other areas. This includes making services better, safer and more cost effective more widely – particularly in addressing differences in outcomes between different geographic regions or diverse patient groups.</p>

<p>Evidence should be as measurable as possible, giving dates for all activities. The personal contribution should be clear, not just detailing the department’s contribution, but stating what they have contributed as part of a wider team if relevant. Specific examples of any changes made after the results of an audit or governance reviews are helpful, as is being clear how they have helped these activities contribute to wider change in the NHS.</p>

<p>Evidence could, for example, cover the impact of work on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing and running audit cycles or plans for evidence-based practice to make the service measurably better</li>
  <li>national or local clinical audits and national confidential enquiries</li>
  <li>developing and using diagnostic and other tools and techniques to find barriers to clinical effectiveness, and ways to overcome them and implement new ways of working</li>
  <li>analysing and managing risk – details of specific improvements of lowered risk and improved safety</li>
  <li>providing a better service, with proof of the effect it has had – for example, how their service has become more patient centred and accessible</li>
  <li>improving the service after speaking to patients or setting up and engaging with patient support groups</li>
  <li>redesigning a service to be more productive and efficient, with no decrease in the quality, particularly at a regional or national level</li>
  <li>developing new health or healthcare plans or policies</li>
  <li>large reviews, inquiries or investigations</li>
  <li>national policies to modernise health services, new ways of working or professional practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Audit or research evidence to show where applicants have improved their service and disseminated this more widely can be helpful. Sources should be quoted with relevant dates and outcomes in their own areas and those of other groups they positively influenced. Changes made, alone or in a team, should be described with evidence that they were of high quality and useful to the wider NHS.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>“The development of a gastro-intestinal bleed service has resulted in excellent outcomes. Mortality 2% vs. 7.1% nationally. Risk standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 0.58 National Audit. I presented these data at xxx conference leading to adoption of new guidelines from 20 xx. My contribution to this outcome was…“&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Based on superior outcomes I developed an international reputation for complex aortic surgery and thoracic abdominal aneurysms attracting referrals from other parts of the country. Our unit has the largest practice in the UK. We pioneered a hybrid open and endovascular operation for aneurysms involving the thoracic and abdominal aorta: first 75 cases elective mortality of 12.5%, elective and urgent of 16%. The world’s best reported results have mortality of 13%. Our thoracic aortic stent programme is the largest in UK with mortality of 3.8%. I have continued to develop my techniques and their assessment through ongoing audit. I have shared these widely leading to their national and international adoption and improvements in national data of xx%. My contribution to these outcomes was…”</p>

<p>“I have developed a continuous patient pathway with GP services for all preadmission clinics and day case surgery patients, ensuring venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment, appropriate thromboprophylaxis (including an extended duration component) with bleeding and VTE incidence, prevalence and follow-up data. This is already improving our understanding and awareness of the issue but also stimulating us to work with GP colleagues to streamline the process and expand its remit more widely. We estimate that, in the area piloted, xx bed days have been saved over the 6-month period of the pilot which has been further expanded into additional trusts with xx impact.”</p>

<p>“I used multidisciplinary team working to effect systemic change throughout our unit, saving nearly 1,000 bed days. This reduced the requirement for elective beds by 25%…I developed 2 half session theatre days. This has greatly improved theatre efficiency…I helped set up and develop the Orthopaedic Outreach Team which greatly reduced length of stay and was highly commended in the 20xx HSJ Awards.”</p>

<h3>Domain 2: leadership</h3>

<p>In this section, look for a significant personal contribution to leading and developing a service, health policy or guidelines with national or international impact. Especially consider work that had delivered against objectives within the NHS Long Term Plan.</p>

<p>Applicants should describe the impact and outcomes generated in the specific roles they list. Evidence can include, but is not limited to, proof of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>effective leadership techniques and processes – give specific examples of improved quality of care for patients and where they have directly or indirectly influenced other parts of the NHS to achieve these benefits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change management programmes or service innovations they have led – making the service more effective, productive or efficient for patients, public and staff outside of their direct remit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>excellent leadership in developing and providing preventative medicine, particularly working across organisational or professional boundaries with other agencies, such as local councils and the voluntary sector, demonstrating the outcomes or impacts that have been delivered – for example in delivering benefits where health inequalities exist</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how applicants helped staff or teams more widely improve patient care – with specific examples and their outcomes such as mentoring or coaching (if they work in England, they could mention the guidance on talent and leadership planning)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any ambassador or change champion roles, for example if in a public consultation or being involved in explaining complex issues and how they translated this into changes in practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how applicants developed a clear, shared vision and desire for change in others – for example, investing in new ways of working and handling resistant behaviour to deliver wider change outside of their remit, particularly where they did not have direct oversight responsibility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how applicants helped staff into senior leadership roles by removing barriers, encouraging diversity and achieving equality and inclusion outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how applicants contributed to developing patient-focused services in their area and cascaded the experience and expertise to influence others to adopt new ways of working</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national impact through personal work and influence through any committee membership. Be specific in what they personally contributed with a description of the impact its output. Membership alone is not enough</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the effects of team leadership with full or joint responsibility or having taken turns with other leaders to lead specific areas of complementary work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where applicants took personal leadership for clinical governance, including developing and implementing policies, services or change programmes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants should include evidence of contribution, the source of any data and relevant dates. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“As the lead obstetrician for Delivery Suite I have improved normal labour and birth through the initiation of a rigorous audit and examination of our processes and the impact of them on maternal and perinatal outcomes. The team’s work was recognised by winning the All Parliamentary Group for Maternity Services Award for 20xx resulting in updating of regional guidelines based on our local experience. This work has been shortlisted for the Royal College of Midwives’ annual award.”</p>

<p>“I continue to lead the weekly obstetric risk management meeting. The reduction in reportable incidents when this meeting was established has continued and has now fallen from x% in 20xx to y% in 20xx. We continue to audit and improve our practice, reporting nationally.”</p>

<p>“I undertook a detailed review and redesign of the antenatal clinic service which has improved patient waiting times. We shared this with our trust leadership and instituted similar practices across the trust and now regionally. This has led to an increased clinic capacity of x over the last 2 years “</p>

<p>“In my role as chairperson of the regional neonatal network between 20xx and 20xx, I championed the rationalisation of beds and care levels across acute hospitals. As a result, transfers of neonates for clinical and nonclinical reasons have reduced by 10% resulting in reduced risk and improved outcomes of …x. See further data below.”</p>

<p>Applicants should not include work or roles in education here, such as chairperson of a training committee. Applicants should include that information in domain 3.</p>

<h4>Domain 3: education, training and people development</h4>

<p>In this section, an applicant should give evidence to show their contribution to wider education and training across the professions and to patients. It should be made clear if any training or lecturing is externally or separately remunerated.</p>

<p>Where relevant, applicants should give evidence of the impact of their work in supporting the NHS People Plan and if it falls into any of the following categories. We do not expect examples for all these categories and other categories can be included.</p>

<h5>Teaching</h5>

<p>This can be medical undergraduate or multidisciplinary team teaching, if it’s outside the job plan. Undergraduate teaching, or local academic management activities (eg chairing an examination board) that are a core parts of an individual’s job plan are not considered to be over and above their role. Applicants are encouraged to give evidence of student feedback or other teacher quality assessments and especially focus on how their educational work has improved others’ performance and has had a positive impact on healthcare. As an assessor, you should look for evidence of a personal role in curriculum development and/or assessment and, if relevant, evidence of wider adoption of novel work in these areas in UK medical schools, or internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Leadership and innovation in training</h5>

<p>This should include evidence of the impact of these activities outside of an applicant’s own remit, preferably nationally or internationally. This might include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>developing and introducing a new course, such as at masters level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>innovative assessment methods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introducing new learning facilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>writing successful textbooks or developing online teaching or training modules, or an app</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contributing to postgraduate education and life-long learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contributing to teaching and assessment in other UK centres or abroad</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing other innovative training methods, such as simulation-based</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Supporting information could be presentations, invitations to lecture, and publications on education – evidence should be included of the wider national impact of these activities.</p>

<h5>Educating and informing patients and public</h5>

<p>Examples could include how applicants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promote good health and disease prevention within the community which has delivered wider impacts</li>
  <li>facilitate the development of patient support groups at a regional or national level that can show improved patient engagement and outcomes, tangible improvements in preventing illness and injury, or improved patient and public involvement in research</li>
</ul>

<h5>College or university success in teaching audits</h5>

<p>An applicant could explain if they helped a college or university succeed in regulatory body and quality assessment audits for teaching. This could include undergraduate or postgraduate exams, or supervising postgraduate students and trainees leading to a demonstrable impact on healthcare as a result.</p>

<h5>Personal commitment to developing teaching skills</h5>

<p>Evidence could be included of higher education academy membership or fellowship and any educationally focused courses completed, and how these new skills or qualifications have been implemented in practice to improve and modernise training and education.</p>

<h5>Unexpected or non-mainstream contributions</h5>

<p>This could be any other teaching or educational commitment that has had national impact and is outside the job plan, or other paid work, that is not recognised in standard ways.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>“My course for xxxx (20xx to 20xx), innovative in its integrated health systems and active learning approaches, has sought and used intensive feedback to enable modification of the course before wider roll out. It is approved for continuing professional development by xxxx, and shows significant gains in knowledge and skills, and excellent participant feedback. This has translated into an x% increase in qualified staff available for xxx work and a resultant increase in quality of care and outcomes from y to z over the 5-year period covering 20xx to 20xx.”</p>

<h4>Domain 4: innovation and research</h4>

<p>This section is intended to look at innovation and its impact in any relevant setting, and could include more evidence than activities traditionally considered as research. It can include new care pathways that have been developed and implemented, improved ways of working and process efficiencies that have been adopted widely, and have demonstrably made more cost effective use of NHS resources. It can also include benefits of digital technology or other activities from projects with external partners that have demonstrated a benefit to the wider NHS, or that support the&nbsp;GMC’s objectives of promoting research for doctors.</p>

<p>Applicants must be clear what evidence is over-and-above any research, academic or other expectations of their role and give evidence of the wider impact of the research and/or innovation. This includes developing the evidence base for measuring how quality has improved.</p>

<p>In the section on references, achievements such as published peer reviewed papers should be detailed – not the names of referees. The majority of any publications listed should be from the last 5 years. Evidence should include the relevance of these publications and wider impact they have had. Providing the number of citations each paper has had or its academic score is not sufficient without further explanation of its impact.</p>

<p>On a separate line, applicants should explain what they have achieved to date and how their innovation or research has quantifiably improved health outcomes. They must give supporting evidence. For example, details of new evidence-based techniques, innovative systems or service models developed that others have adopted. Explain how they found better ways to deliver direct clinical benefits and made more effective use of resources having disseminated experience that has been adopted by others. Specific details of the quantified benefits this has provided over a relevant dated time period should be present.</p>

<p>Applicants could also explain how they have improved patient and public engagement in research and innovation or encouraged new ways of thinking when it comes to improving.</p>

<p>Applicants should describe the effect of their research (including laboratory research) and any new techniques developed and the wider benefits they have delivered on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health service practice</li>
  <li>health service policy</li>
  <li>developing health services</li>
</ul>

<p>They should be clear how their research is relevant to the health of patients and the public.</p>

<p>They could give details of the impacts delivered as a result of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>large trials or evaluations (including systematic reviews) they led or coinvestigated, and published in the last 5 years</li>
  <li>how they have contributed as a research leader and helped and supervised other people’s research and mentored new investigators</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants could include other examples of the personal impact in their chosen research fields. For example, how they worked on any review boards of national funding agencies or learned societies and delivered quantifiable improvements over a defined time period.</p>

<p>Applicants could also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>list any grants they hold personally (specify your role as chief or principal investigator where relevant) – not department grants – and how this funding is being used to deliver benefits</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>describe peer-reviewed publications, chapters or books written or edited – listing editorial activity for each one, for example senior editor, and any quantitative measures on how effective they have been in changing practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>applicants should give details if they played a major part in research studies in more than one centre, for example personally recruiting participants to large clinical trials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include evidence of outstanding research that has led to new ways of preventing illness and injury, or more rapid, cost-effective, and reliable diagnosis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>indicate how they have engaged with a funding council, National Institute for Health Research (<abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>) or a major research charity, specifying their role (clinical director, senior reviewer, or research or fellowship programme lead). They must give clear dates, and evidence of impact.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“As Director of Research and Development (R&amp;D) in the last 3 years, I have positioned the trust as one of the leading 5 NHS research centres in the country, and developed a research service to support clinicians with robust governance processes, a clinical trials office, a research design service, and funding for research time. This has led to an increase in research output of x, which has provided input to xxx national guidelines and policies.”</p>

<p>“My research is in stroke, which is a public health priority for prevention and improvement of care. The development of a public health model for chronic disease using stroke has proved relevant to assessing needs and evaluating innovative models of care improving prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of stroke from y to z. In acute stroke, we have reduced time to assessment and intervention from x hours to y hours over the last 3 years resulting in improved outcomes and functionally independent discharge rates from y% to x%  My R&amp;D leadership role has enabled academic and clinical organisations to develop joint National Institute for Health Research (<abbr title="National Institute for Health Research">NIHR</abbr>) centres in biomedical and health services research and training for population and patient benefit.”</p>

<p>“I have developed booking systems for use in emergency and trauma theatre settings. These secure systems allow cases to be booked into emergency theatres from anywhere in the hospital, informing all emergency staff of pending cases and their preparedness. The system links with hospital investigation reporting systems allowing blood investigations for each patient to be accessed. In addition, the trauma booking system can be linked to a radiological teaching package. When a fracture type is booked onto the system, the booking doctor is offered the opportunity to look at the system of classification for that fracture type and to review teaching radiographs of each type. The system won a 20xx national Theatre Innovation Award for IT and has improved our outcomes from x to y over the last 5 years. I have piloted the wider use of these systems outside of our trust and these have been adopted in 5 other trusts with a net benefit of x”</p>

<h4>Domain 5: additional national impact&nbsp;</h4>

<p>This domain is an opportunity for applicants to provide evidence of wider beneficial impacts that have not been captured elsewhere in the evidence, or to demonstrate how their work has had a wider effect on areas that are national clinical priorities. These aspects may relate to work within their job plan but should demonstrate the national impact over and above the expectations of paid activities.</p>

<p>Applicants can include any work for charitable organisations, and work which may have more of a patient or public focus, tackling health and workplace inequalities and fostering interprofessional team building or new ways of working. It can also include international work in training, research or recruitment that is of clear benefit to the NHS.</p>

<p>Other relevant activities might be NHS priority disease areas such as cancer, its diagnosis, prevention, treatment and outcomes, communicable and non-communicable diseases or other areas where there is outstanding need or identified health inequalities or disparities. It may also cover public health and patient care pathways. For example, demonstrating how applicants prevented inappropriate emergency department attendance or generated other benefits, such as working with social care providers or third parties in other ways.</p>

<p>Applicants could include work on delivering wider health policies or their impact related to the NHS Long Term Plan and/or the NHS People Plan, particularly in reference to collaborative working, demonstrating an inclusive culture and the health and wellbeing of NHS staff and their retention in the face of increasing pressures. They should detail how they have delivered wider change and the magnitude of their impacts over a defined time period.&nbsp;Leadership work at a regional or national level in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/delivery-plan-for-tackling-the-covid-19-backlog-of-elective-care/" rel="external">delivery of the COVID-19 backlog plan</a> should define the impact of their personal contribution.</p>

<p>Applicants may provide evidence of the impact on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-integration-joining-up-care-for-people-places-and-populations">delivering improved joined up care</a> in line with its recommendations in optimal settings, by implementing new service models or specifically digital innovations or efficiencies across the wider health environments. This is particularly if they have expanded these beyond their immediate area or remit. Activities and innovations that have been developed in partnership with external partners that have provided positive impacts to the NHS and are in line with the government’s life sciences strategy may be included.</p>

<p>Applicants could include impacts on outcomes improvement, particularly in areas identified with unmet need or where there is undue variation in outcomes across the NHS.</p>

<p>This domain could also be used to provide additional evidence that is related to evidence from a prior domain. Do not repeat evidence however, as it will only be scored once. You may wish to take the opportunity to demonstrate a different aspect of your work that is over and above your job role and how this has had incremental impact as a result.</p>

<h3>What assessors are looking for in <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> citations</h3>

<p>Assessors use rankings and citations to triangulate and corroborate applicants’ evidence of national impact provided in the domains. Citations could corroborate recent evidence of:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>wider patient or other benefit outside the immediate area of responsibility that has evidence of a positive impact on NHS efficiency or cost-effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impact of innovation and/or research through it being implemented into widespread use, guidelines or other national care pathways</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impact of postgraduate education and training on resource use or improvements in service quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>widespread uptake of new technology or guidance in clinical practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>citations and rankings should not focus on the work for, or the benefit to, the <abbr title="National nominating organisation">NNO</abbr> specifically, without relevant national impact on the NHS</p>
  </li>
</ul>
