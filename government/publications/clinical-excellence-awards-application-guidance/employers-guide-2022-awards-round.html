<h2>About this guide</h2>

<p>This guide is to aid employers in signing off applications from NHS consultant doctors, dentists and academic GPs for new Clinical Impact Awards. It covers the 2022 national Clinical Impact Awards (<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>) competition in England and Wales and tells you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the changes made to simplify and improve the award scheme for 2022</li>
  <li>how the award scheme works</li>
  <li>how the new application and assessment processes work</li>
  <li>your role in the process as an employer</li>
</ul>

<p>Read this guide before providing employer sign-off and use the information within it as a reference guide when supporting an application. Part 1 and Part 2 provide an overview of the scheme and its principles and processes, while Part 3, Part 4 and Part 5 explain how things work in more detail and the role you play as an employer.</p>

<p>We’ve created a useful quick guide to the scheme (primarily designed for applicants) that summarises how the new 2022 scheme is designed to work – see all guides on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you’re based in Wales, you’ll find anything extra you need to know in the boxes throughout this guide.</p>
</div>

<p>When the award round opens on April 2022, go to the application portal to ensure you can log in to support applications from your employees.</p>

<p>For any assistance, you can contact the Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>) Secretariat at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Applicants must have submitted their application by 5pm on 22 June 2022. As an employer you must have confirmed your sign-off for an application by this deadline, or applicants will be unable to submit them. Any applications received after this time will not be considered.</p>

<h2>Changes to the application and scoring processes</h2>

<p>Following the 2021 consultation on reform of the national Clinical Excellence Awards (<abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>), the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and Welsh Government have agreed the following changes will be implemented in a revised scheme as the national Clinical Impact Awards. Review the full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a> for further detail on the reforms.</p>

<h3>Summary of the changes</h3>

<h4>Increase the number of available awards</h4>

<p>Once the transition process for existing national Clinical Excellence Award holders has been completed over the 5 year transitional period, there will be up to 600 awards granted annually in England.</p>

<p>National awards and local awards are also planned to be held concurrently – this is being reviewed throughout the transition period.</p>

<h4>Rebrand the scheme</h4>

<p>The awards have been rebranded as the national Clinical Impact Awards to reflect to applicants and scorers that the primary focus of the awards is the output of activities, rather than undertaking activities in the absence of describing their impact and results.</p>

<h4>Restructure the award levels</h4>

<p> In England, the scheme now operates as a 3-level award system: </p>

<ul>
  <li>national 1 (lowest)</li>
  <li>national 2</li>
  <li>national 3 (highest)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Refresh the assessment domains</h4>

<p>The assessment domains have been revised to combine both ‘Delivering and Developing Service’ into a single new domain (domain 1). Three domains (domain 2, 3 and 4) have been renumbered and their emphases amended, and a new fifth domain has been introduced to allow applicants to include evidence of national impact from other unpaid activities, or where they have delivered impact over and above expectations.</p>

<h4>Simplify the application process</h4>

<p>A single-level application process has been introduced so applicants no longer apply for an award at a specific level. This enables applicants to gain higher level awards on first application based on the score they attain. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Remove pro-rated awards</h4>

<p>Those working less than full time (<abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr>) will no longer have their post-2022 award payments pro-rated. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Remove the renewals process</h3>

<p>The renewals process has been removed. <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> will be held for a total of 5 years, at which point applicants need to reapply. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Remove the pensionability of awards</h4>

<p><abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are no longer pensionable or consolidated. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Simplify the process for employers</h4>

<p>Employers only need to indicate their support or their lack of support for an application and provide a citation for each applicant. Employer scoring and ranking are no longer required. Further information about employer citations is included below in Part 5.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Differences for those based in Wales</h3>

<p>In Wales, all of the above changes apply except for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of awards – proportionate to the size of the consultant workforce and the level of commitment awards successful applicants in Wales will hold, there will be up to 37 awards granted per year once the transition process has completed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the structure of awards levels – the scheme will continue with 4 levels:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>level 0</li>
      <li>level 1</li>
      <li>level 2</li>
      <li>level 3&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>concurrent awards – consultants will be able to access both commitment awards and hold a national Clinical Impact Award at the same time from 2022 onwards</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>How we’ve streamlined our application process</h3>

<p>We’ve streamlined our processes to make applying for an award simpler.</p>

<p>We’ve removed the additional forms for evidence and increased the character limit on the main form to 2,000 characters for all domains. Applicants only need to submit one form for scoring. We’ve adapted the references section in the new ‘Domain 3: innovation and research’ to remove any character limit.</p>

<p>We’ve reduced the list of accredited national nominating bodies and specialist societies to reduce duplication within and across specialties. All accredited ranking organisations will now be known as national nominating organisations (<abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr>), amending and rebalancing the number of ranking places available to each specialty, in proportion to the number of eligible consultants. Each applicant can now only have one ranking and citation from one relevant <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>.</p>

<p>We’ve removed the option to seek third-party citations. Citations are only possible from the list of <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> for those applicants ranked by them in their prioritisation exercises.</p>

<p>We will evaluate the number of applications to be scored in each region and continue to adjust scoring groups and numbers across regions to balance the workload and optimise committee diversity. This will ensure enough scorers are available to assess each application.</p>

<p>Regional subcommittee scoring will continue, with each region being given an indicative number of awards at each level (N1/N2/N3) to retain the equity of regional opportunity for success. This continues to be based on the number of awards available nationally and the number of applications received. Applications tied at the cut off for the lower limit of N1, or tied between N1 and N2, will be rescored by the National Reserve Sub-committee (<abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>), as will any applications identified through national governance review. Further details are set out below in Part 4 of this guide.</p>

<p>To decide which applicants gain an N3 award, each region’s highest scoring applicants constituting twice their N3 indicative number will be pooled nationally and rescored by the N3 Committee to determine those most deserving of the highest-level national award. Those who are unsuccessful at N3 will be recommended for an N2 award.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<p>In 2018, the government approved schedule 30 of the 2003 consultant contract which was negotiated and agreed between NHS Employers and the British Medical Association (BMA). This provides transitional pay protection where a new national scheme has lower award values. This protection is costly – peaking at over £30 million in 2025 to 2026. As the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme must stay within the agreed budget, pay protection has an impact on the funding available for new awards in the transitional period. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/articles/local-clinical-excellence-award-lcea-arrangements" rel="external">Details of pay protection arrangements for existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders applying for and successfully gaining their first <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr></a> can be found in schedule 30.</p>

<p>We have advised applicants to review this carefully and discuss their personal circumstances with you if they have any questions. Any questions relating to awards that you as employers cannot answer can be put to <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cost of pay protection means we have altered some elements of the scheme for the transitional period. These elements will be reviewed periodically, and any necessary adjustments will be made each year. For example, local awards and national awards cannot be held at the same time at the moment, and the numbers of <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> made available at each level may vary during the transition period.</p>

<h3>Key change for employers to note</h3>

<p>As an employer you are no longer required to score or rank applicants from your organisation. You will only need to indicate whether or not you support an application (support is the default choice) and provide an explanatory citation. Qualified support is no longer an option.</p>

<h2>Part 1: introduction</h2>

<h3>About <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> and the Clinical Impact Awards scheme</h3>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> runs the national Clinical Impact Awards scheme for the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) in England.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The advisory committee also provides governance for the awards for the Welsh government.</p>
</div>

<p>Health ministers agree a limited number of new awards each year, so the selection process is very competitive.</p>

<p>A consultant can apply for a new award at any time after completing a full year in an eligible role. If a consultant already holds a national Clinical Excellence Award, transitional arrangements apply between the old and new schemes. To be considered, the applicant will need to show that what has been delivered has had an impact at a national level, and over and above the expectations defined in their job plan in developing and delivering a high quality service.</p>

<p>There will also be a need to demonstrate a commitment to, and nationally relevant impact on improving the NHS through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leadership</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>training</li>
  <li>people development</li>
  <li>innovation and research</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also an opportunity to provide evidence of national impact in areas that are not captured in the 4 domains, particularly if it relates to published NHS or other relevant health objectives. In all of the domains, applicants should consider providing evidence of national impact relating to equality, diversity and inclusion. 
There is one online application form for all awards, so every applicant can highlight their contributions in the same way.</p>

<p>Based on the strength of applications, our regional sub-committees, N3 committee and our main committee will recommend applicants for national awards to health ministers for them to approve.</p>

<h3>How national awards relate to local awards</h3>

<p>The aim for the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme is to allow local and national awards to be held concurrently, but due to the costs of transitional pay protection explained above this is not possible straightaway. In 2022, they will not be held at the same time – this will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. As an employer in England, you will be managing your own local award schemes – the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/" rel="external">NHS Employers website</a> contains further information. We will expect you to manage the exclusion of any local payments to any <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> holders, existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders for the duration of their award and any <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> holders who are benefitting from the schedule 30 pay protection.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, employers give commitment awards. You can find more information about these in the amended&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/Documents/433/Nat_Consultant_Contract.pdf" rel="external">National Consultant Contract in Wales 2003</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>National awards are awarded by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>. They recognise the national impact of work undertaken over and above contractual or other paid activities in the NHS (in England and Wales). They specifically recognise the dissemination and implementation of that work and its impact on the wider NHS and on public health. There is no requirement to hold any local award to be eligible to apply for a national award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 3 levels of national awards in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>national level 1 (N1)</li>
  <li>national level 2 (N2)</li>
  <li>national level 3 (N3)</li>
</ul>

<p>N3 is the highest award.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Four award levels are available in Wales, with N0 being added as a lowest level to account for a Welsh-only level that differs from that in England.</p>
</div>

<h3>What the national scheme rewards</h3>

<p>The scheme rewards consultants or academic GPs who deliver national impact above the expectations of their job role or other paid work. Applicants need to give evidence of impact across the following 5 domains:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delivering and developing a high-quality service&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Leadership&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Education, training and people development&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Innovation and research&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Other areas of national impact, with specific reference to NHS priorities where relevant&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>These 5 domains are explained below in Part 4 and Part 5 of this guide.</p>

<p>We do not give awards for standalone overseas work. Work in other countries is not directly relevant for an award so we cannot consider it on its own, but if an applicant can show evidence that overseas work has helped the NHS and the health of the public directly, or has had a direct reputational benefit for the NHS overseas, it may be supported.</p>

<h3>How we assess applications</h3>

<p>We run the scheme fairly and openly offering every applicant an equal opportunity, and we consider all applications on merit. We include our analysis of each year’s competition in our annual report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We assess all applications against the same criteria which you can find below in Part 4 of this guide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our sub-committees are regional groups that assess applications for national awards for most applicants in their area. Based on application workload, and to provide balance and a degree of external scrutiny across these committees, we reallocate some sub-committee members to score in other regions (see Part 4 for more information).</p>

<p>There are 13 regional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards/about/our-governance#sub-committees"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> sub-committees</a> in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cheshire and Mersey</li>
  <li>East of England</li>
  <li>East Midlands</li>
  <li>London North East</li>
  <li>London North West</li>
  <li>London South</li>
  <li>North East</li>
  <li>North West</li>
  <li>South</li>
  <li>South East</li>
  <li>South West</li>
  <li>West Midlands</li>
  <li>Yorkshire and Humber</li>
</ul>

<p>There are separate sub-committees for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and arm’s length bodies (<abbr title="arm’s length bodies">ALBs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>assessing the highest-scoring regional applicants for N3 awards – <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Wales has its own sub-committees.</p>
</div>

<p>The sub-committees consider all applications in their area except for those from public health consultants and academic GPs contracted by Public Health England and NHS England. These are assessed by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or arm’s length body (<abbr title="arm’s length body">ALB</abbr>) sub-committee where they can be benchmarked more easily. Each regional sub-committee is allocated an indicative number of awards at each level. This is based on the number of national awards available proportionately distributed based on the number of applications received that year in each region. This means there is an equal chance of achieving an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> in any region.</p>

<p>Sub-committee members come from a range of backgrounds with experience and expertise in many different areas. They assess and score applications independently. All the individual scores for an application are averaged and then ranked against the other applications in that region. The top scoring applications in each region are provisionally allocated an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>. To ensure the highest level awards are granted to those making the greatest national impact, a separate N3 sub-committee will rescore all those from each region falling within the N3 indicative allocation, plus the same number of applicants scoring highest in the N2 allocation. This rescoring provides a national benchmarking for determining who receives an N3 award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each sub-committee is typically made up of:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>medical and dental professionals – 50%</li>
  <li>non-medical professionals and lay members – 25%</li>
  <li>employers – 25%</li>
</ul>

<p>Each sub-committee is normally divided into scoring groups to manage the workload. We ensure there is equivalent diversity of scorers across these groups. These groups score a randomly selected group of applications to minimise any unconscious bias affecting the scoring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each group scores applications consistently against the guidance. We expect there to be up to 600 new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> available each year in England – subject to ministerial agreement and funding impacts during the transitional period. Our ambition is to award 330 x N1, 200 x N2 and 70 x N3 awards each year at a value of £20,000, £30,000, and £40,000 respectively. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When an application for an award is successful, the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> will last 5 years backdated to 1 April 2022.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, the process for assessing applicants is different. For more details contact Chantelle Herbert or Darren Lewis at the Wales Secretariat at&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HSSWorkforceOD@gov.wales">HSSWorkforceOD@gov.wales</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>After regional sub-committee scoring has closed and the ranked list has been produced, our chair and medical director review all the provisionally successful N1 and N2 applications that are not being considered for an N3 award. After their review, applications where questions arise or clarification may be helpful are discussed at the regional sub-committee meetings as part of our quality and governance review.</p>

<p>Applications that are tied at the cut-off point for N1 or between N1 and N2 awards are automatically referred for rescoring by <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr>.</p>

<p>Applications where questions have not been resolved are also referred to <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> for rescoring. <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> is made up of the chairs and medical vice-chairs of the regional sub-committees and other experienced scorers from the regions. As a panel of our most experienced scorers, <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> acts as a quality assurance mechanism. 
Our chair and medical director recommend applications for awards to our main committee based on the sub-committee and <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> scores.</p>

<p>Following scrutiny from our main committee, English recommendations go to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Recommendations from the Wales sub-committee go to Welsh ministers for final approval, after scrutiny from the main committee.</p>
</div>

<p>If an award is approved, we will let the applicant and their employer know. Unsuccessful applicants will be informed at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Local awards and commitment awards</h3>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> does not have any say in local awards in England or commitment awards in Wales.</p>

<h3>Running an open, transparent scheme</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a list of all national award holders</li>
  <li>personal statements from people who have received a new award</li>
  <li>the members of our main committee and our sub-committees</li>
  <li>a list of national nominating organisations</li>

<h3>Disability</h3>

<p>In line with the Equality Act 2010, employers must consider making reasonable adjustments for employees with disabilities. These are changes to things such as equipment or processes to make sure people with disabilities can do their job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If an applicant has a disability, where relevant, any reasonable adjustments they have agreed with you should be explained in the job plan section of the application form. You may add explanations about any disabilities or other relevant aspects in your comments.</p>

<p>We treat all applications equally and use the same scoring criteria for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Extenuating circumstances</h3>

<p>If there are extenuating circumstances that an applicant feels may affect their ability to submit a successful application, we would like them to let us know as soon as possible before the application closing date, so we can provide support and make sure the application is considered fairly. We cannot take any extenuating circumstances into account after the application form has been submitted and it has been scored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each case is treated on its own merits, and the outcomes from each one are based on the rules relating to the current scheme. If a consultant applies for an award and believes there are extenuating circumstances, these can be described in the job plan, personal statement and/or the relevant domains of the application form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to be precise about the timing of any such changes in working pattern, and to provide dates for the achievements that they are presenting for assessment.&nbsp;For example, an applicant may describe periods of absence due to maternity leave or ill-health during the relevant 5 year period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We understand that it can be difficult for applicants to share personal information. As employers we expect you to support your employees so that they feel comfortable sharing this information in the knowledge that it will be treated with respect and in confidence. Extenuating circumstances should not put off a consultant applying, but it is important that we know about them in a timely fashion so the sub-committee can take them into account in the scoring process as required. If you are aware of any extenuating circumstances that you want to comment upon, please use the employer section of the form for this.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements for people with existing national Clinical Excellence Awards</h3>

<p>With the introduction of a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme from 2022, existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders are subject to prior <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> rules for their awards and tenure. There is a transitional period based on previously agreed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/Schedule-30-March-2021_0.pdf" rel="external">schedule 30 arrangements</a> for <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders applying for a first new award.</p>

<p>Rules that apply to existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> holders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if an application is made for a first new award before an existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> would have been due for renewal under the old scheme and are unsuccessful, the individual keeps their existing <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> until its expiry - they may apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> again up to the year before the <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>’s expiry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> would have been due for renewal and the application is unsuccessful, the reversion arrangements to receive a legacy, pensionable local <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> will continue to apply. The level of the local award depends on the score obtained in the new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a consultant applies in the year their national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> expires, this <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> will lapse before the annual <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> award round is completed and the applicant will not be eligible for the transitional arrangements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if an applicant successfully gains a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> before their existing NCEA expires, the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> will start when the NCEA expires – the value of legacy CEAs and its pensionable benefits are protected for the duration of the first new award at an equivalent level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if&nbsp;an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> is gained at an equivalent or higher level to their national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>, the payment received will be no less than the value of their existing national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> is gained at a lower equivalent level, the applicant will receive no less than the legacy national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> payment at that level – there will be an obligation in this case&nbsp;to accept the new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> and give up any unexpired NCEA; local awards cannot be held simultaneously with <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> awards that benefit from schedule 30 protection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The equivalent levels are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>N1 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to silver <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>N2 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to gold <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>N3 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to platinum <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Any <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> award holders who enter the transitional arrangements will not currently be eligible for local <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, due to the cost of the transitional arrangements, <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> holders are not eligible for local awards in England at the same time whether or not they held a prior national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr>. This will be reviewed during and after the transition period to see when national and local awards can be held concurrently. You can read more information about this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 2: eligibility for <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Who can apply for an award</h3>

<p>To apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, a doctor or dentist needs to be a fully registered medical or dental practitioner on the General Dental Council (<abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>) special list, General Medical Council (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>) specialist list or GP register.</p>

<p>The applicant must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fully registered with a licence to practise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a permanent NHS consultant or academic GP in a permanent clinical academic role in higher education at the same level as a senior lecturer or above,&nbsp;for at least one year on 1 April in the award year – the year does not include time spent as a locum, but applicants can give evidence from their achievements as a locum in the same role</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For consultants in a locum role for more than one year, we may consider them eligible for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> if you as their employer confirm that they are employed on terms consistent with a permanent consultant contract.</p>

<p>In all cases, an applicant must be on an NHS consultant contract expressed in programmed activities (<abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>), or on an academic contract expressed in an equivalent pay scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Consultants working in Wales must be on an NHS consultant contract expressed in sessions, or on an academic contract expressed in an equivalent pay scale.</p>

<p>If one of your employees is unsure about whether they are eligible, please do not hesitate to contact the ACCIA Secretariat at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Qualifying criteria</h4>

<p>A consultant will qualify if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employed by an NHS organisation (in England or Wales), <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or its arm’s length bodies, a university, medical or dental school, or local authority. Applications from employees of other organisations may be eligible, including those on consultant contracts providing contracted out NHS services. Those individuals are encouraged to&nbsp;contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a> before applying if any clarification is required</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, an applicant will also qualify if they are employed by similar Welsh government-associated organisations.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an academic GP if their responsibilities are the same as consultant clinical academic staff and they are fully registered with a licence to practise. An academic GP can apply for an award if they:&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>work at least half their hours as an academic GP</li>
      <li>are a practising clinician providing some direct NHS services</li>
      <li>do at least 5 <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr> or equivalent sessions that help the NHS – including teaching and clinical research</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a consultant or a dental practitioner with an honorary NHS contract who is fully registered with a licence to practise. Whether they qualify for an award does not only depend on their contribution to the NHS in the provision of direct patient care. A full-time academic consultant will also qualify for an award if they carry out at least 5 programmed clinical activities or equivalent sessions that help the NHS. This includes teaching, training and clinical research. An applicant who works less than full time and does fewer than 3 programmed clinical activities (<abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>) is not eligible to apply for an award</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a fully registered public health consultant on the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> specialist register or on the <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> specialist list with a licence to practise</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a postgraduate dean, fully registered with the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> with a licence to practise, who competed for the role against GPs and consultants and is responsible for postgraduate trainees across all specialties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a consultant or academic GP later employed as a dean or head of school in medicine or dentistry, fully registered with the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> with a licence to practise. They can apply for an award based on their work in this post</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a consultant fully registered with the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> with a licence to practise working as an NHS organisation clinical or medical director, or a similar level medical manager post. We would anticipate consultants working in this capacity clarifying their eligibility with <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> prior to application – with particular reference to their contractual contribution over-and-above the expected duties in the role, as well as their contractual status. If the majority of the work is in a management role, an applicant can still qualify if they have an active consultant contract with a specific clinical or clinical leadership role, and maintains their licence to practise. If a consultant moves into general management and/or has a management contract outside the consultant pay scale, they are not eligible to apply for an award</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As an NHS consultant, it does not make a difference if they have agreed to the national terms and conditions of service, or other terms with an individual organisation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence runs its own award scheme, but we also recognise eligible NHS employee contributions over-and-above the expected standards to military medical and dental services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a consultant works <abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr>, they can apply for an award if they undertake a minimum of 3 clinically relevant contractual <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>. If an applicant is eligible based on this minimum <abbr title="programmed activity">PA</abbr> requirement and is successful, we will pay&nbsp;the full award. However, if a consultant is working <abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr> and in a transition provision from a national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> based on schedule 30 legacy award values, they will receive a pro-rated award.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Retirement and pensions arrangements</h3>

<p>If a consultant retires during an awards round before we announce the results, we take this to mean that the application has been withdrawn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> would have been due for renewal in 2022 and a consultant expects to retire up to 6 months after the award is due to expire in March 2023, we may consider extending the award without the need to apply for a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>National <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> awards are consolidated with the pension, which means it is taken into account when the pension is calculated. These awards stop when a consultant retires or claims their pension. If a consultant takes all or part of their pension from the NHS Pension Scheme, Universities Superannuation Scheme or transferred out benefits, they do not qualify for an existing award. If they return to work on a permanent NHS consultant contract retaining or regaining full registration with a licence to practise, they can apply for a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are not consolidated with pensions. If a consultant retires with an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, the award will end – coincident with loss of eligibility.&nbsp;Further details are available in the applicants’ guide on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a></p>

<p>If a retired consultant applies for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> when they come back to work, assessors and employers should only&nbsp;consider and reflect upon the consultant’s achievements since their new contract started. They should not consider evidence used to apply for the last award, evidence from before the new contract date, or evidence that is not clearly dated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A consultant who did not have a national award when they retired can still apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Consultants that may not be eligible for an award</h3>

<p>A consultant is not eligible to apply for an award if they are:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>not on the consultant pay scale as expressed in <abbr title="programmed activity">PA</abbr> or an equivalent</li>
  <li>a locum consultant – though if an applicant then becomes a permanent consultant, they can potentially use evidence from the locum role in their application if it is relevant&nbsp;</li>
  <li>a consultant who primarily works in general management, such as a chief executive, general manager, chief operating officer, or a senior university office-holder without a specific clinical role&nbsp;</li>
  <li>not fully registered with a licence to practise</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigations into a consultant’s work and disciplinary or legal action against an individual can affect their award or application. This includes interim, temporary or final court orders or penalties relating to professional or personal conduct that may reflect badly on their judgement, or the expected standards of the profession.</p>

<p>Consultants must let us know about any investigations or sanctions by an employer or professional regulator (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>) and their progression, interim and final decisions and any sanctions. We will look at each case individually, but we may remove an award if there are adverse outcomes following investigations or disciplinary measures, or if we believe a doctor has failed to notify us appropriately or in a timely manner. If this happens, any over payments will need to be repaid.&nbsp;If you as an employer become aware of such matters, you are also expected to notify <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also ask about an organisation’s latest inspection outcome. If your organisation is in special measures, we expect a consultant to comment on any relevance of this to their role. We will also ask you to check that you are happy with any response when you sign off the application. If a consultant is on the board of a organisation in special measures and is recommended for an award, we will inform our main committee.</p>

<h2>Part 3: the application process</h2>

<h3>Filling in the application</h3>

<p>A consultant must fill in their own application form – nobody else can do it for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applications can only be made online at the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application portal. Detailed advice on how to make an application is available in the applicants’ guide on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a>.</p>

<p>On application, a consultant must first select the NHS or arm’s length body that holds their substantive or honorary contract and their specialty, so that the right sub-committee considers the application. The employer is selectable via a ‘Pull-down’ menu in the new online application form. If an individual is employed by more than one body, they are asked to state all of their employers and roles – being clear which is the main employer based on who pays their salary.</p>

<h3>Supporting applications</h3>

<p>We cannot accept applications without your sign-off. In order to sign off your employees’ applications, you need to complete the shortened ‘Part 2’ of the application form. Joint sign-off from all employers is required if an applicant holds a contract with more than one.</p>

<p>If you are signing off an application for a consultant who also works for a university (clinical academic)&nbsp;as the chief executive of the NHS organisation where they hold an honorary contract, or their nominated deputy, you should complete this section. It is <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>’s expectation that both the relevant NHS organisation and the university or medical school will be involved in the approval process and the preparation of any supporting citation, and that an up-to-date job plan has been agreed by both parties.</p>

<p>A consultant&nbsp;applying for a new award can seek support from a royal college or society with which they may be associated (an <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>).&nbsp;Our list of approved nominating organisations is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> home page</a>. They may choose to rank the application in comparison with other applicants and provide a supporting citation. An applicant is only allowed to have a ranking or endorsement from one <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;endorsement is sought from more than one <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>, it is the responsibility of the applicant to be transparent with all parties. Only 2 <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> can be selected, and only one final <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> ranking and citation will be accepted by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> and employers are expected to have processes that ensure equality and diversity. You as employers are also expected to have a balanced representation of applicants from your consultant staff as should <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> from their membership.&nbsp;The guidance for <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> contains further information.</p>

<h3>Timetable for 2022 national awards</h3>

<p>Consultants must submit their online national Clinical Impact Award application to <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> by 5pm on 22 June 2022. Applications will not be valid after this – regardless of the reason that the deadline was missed. You must therefore ensure applications have received your sign-off with enough lead in time for submission before this deadline.</p>

<p>The indicative timetable for the 2022 awards round is set out below. This may change based on the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other operational factors – we will review it regularly:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>27 April to 22 June 2022 – applications open</li>
  <li>27 June to 4 September 2022 – scoring</li>
  <li>8 September to 9 October 2022 – N3 scoring</li>
  <li>12 September to 25 November 2022 – governance review</li>
  <li>14 November to 11 December 2022 – <abbr title="National Reserve Sub-committee">NRES</abbr> scoring</li>
  <li>December 2022 – main committee finalisation of recommendations</li>
  <li>January 2023 – recommendations to and sign off by ministers</li>
  <li>End of January 2023 – notifications sent to successful applicants and Finance processes initiated to back pay awards</li>
  <li>February 2023 – appeals window opens</li>
</ul>

<h3>General advice for supporting applicants</h3>

<p>As an employer you should advise applicants to start their application early enough to allow time for your sign-off, as well as engage with a nominating organisation according to their timescales.</p>

<p>When a consultant fills in their application form, they are advised to follow the steps indicated in the applicants’ guide. Knowing what advice has been provided to applicants should help you support your employees in knowing what makes a good application and where problems and inconsistencies may arise.</p>

<p>We make it clear that if there are special circumstances that could affect an application such as ill health, we are keen to know as soon as possible before the deadline as we may consider extending an award.&nbsp;You should support employees in feeling comfortable to provide further information on any extenuating circumstances, and if appropriate with their agreement, you may provide additional relevant information.</p>

<h2>Part 4: the assessment process</h2>

<p>While we have moved to a non-stratified system of scoring with no renewals, the fundamental principles and processes of the assessment scheme have not changed.&nbsp;As explained above, an online application form will be submitted for competitive scoring in the first instance to one of the 13 regional sub-committees or to the <abbr title="arm’s length body">ALB</abbr> committee, with separate arrangements in place for applicants in Wales and for the armed services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of awards potentially available for each region is calculated based on the total number of awards available in any year at each level, allocated proportionately in line with the number of applications. This ensures that applicants have an equal chance of success in each region.</p>

<p>More details can be found in Part 5 of the applicants’ guide on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a>.</p>

<h3>Regional sub-committees</h3>

<p>A regional sub-committee (<abbr title="regional sub-committee">RSC</abbr>) has a lay chair, medical vice-chair (<abbr title="medical vice-chair">MVC</abbr>) and typically between 15 and 30 members.&nbsp;These roles are voluntary and regularly refreshed.&nbsp;Applications are vetted and approved by the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> chair and medical director.&nbsp;A number of new chairs and MVCs&nbsp;have been appointed in 2022.</p>

<p>Further information on the responsibilities and structure of <abbr title="regional sub-committees">RSCs</abbr> can be found in the assessors’ guide which will be available shortly.</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>Clinical impact is about providing high quality services to patients that go beyond the applicant’s immediate remit that improves clinical outcomes for as many patients as possible, use resources efficiently and make national services more productive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applicants need to show assessors evidence of how they made these services more efficient and productive, and improved quality at the same time, as well as demonstrating their role as an enabler and leader of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health provision</li>
  <li>prevention and policy development</li>
  <li>implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> and assessors need to be sure all achievements are relevant and need to know when they occurred, or if these activities are continuing or stopped. It is essential that the dates of achievements are clear, as without dates they cannot be scored highly – when discussing any applications with your employees we would advise emphasising this point.</p>

<p>Applicants do not need to show they have achieved over-and-above expected standards in all 5 domains – a lot will depend on the type and nature of their post and job role. Excellent local or regional contributions can score well if they have been disseminated and had an impact on the wider NHS. This is especially true when there are direct national and international impacts&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our assessors score the domain sections according to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 = an application is excellent with clear and sustained national and or international impact</li>
  <li>6 = the work is over-and-above contract terms and has at least a regional impact beyond the local area</li>
  <li>2 = the applicant has met the terms of their contract or may have contributed more, mainly within their locality</li>
  <li>0 = the applicant has not met the terms of their contract or there is not enough information to make a judgement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of domains</h3>

<h4>Domain 1: delivering and developing a high-quality service&nbsp;</h4>

<p>In this section, give evidence of what has been achieved in relation to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>providing and developing a safe service with measurable, effective clinical outcomes based on delivery of high technical and clinical standards of service that provides a good experience for patients, and how it has been cascaded more widely to colleagues who have implemented improvements based on this experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consistently looking for and introducing ways to improve their service – sharing the learning and seeing it embedded in practice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants should explain which activities relate to clinical services where they are paid by the NHS, and to other aspects of their work as a consultant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applicants should include quantified measures – like outcome data. These need to reflect the whole service of the multi-professional team provide and how they have collectively disseminated their experience. Applicants should use validated indicators for quality improvement or quality standards and other reference data sources in England or the healthcare standards for Wales – ideally providing performance data against benchmark or national indicators for their specialty showing local and wider improvements as a result of their work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For good patient experience, applicants should show how they have ensured patients are cared for with compassion, integrity and dignity and how they have demonstrated commitment to patient safety and wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further information on evidence that applicants could provide for this domain and some examples can be found in the applicants’ guide.</p>

<h4>Domain 2: leadership</h4>

<p>In this section, assessors will look for a significant personal contribution to leading and developing a service, health policy or guidelines with national or international impact. Consider work that had delivered against objectives within the ‘NHS Long Term Plan’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applicants should describe the impact and outcomes generated in the specific roles they list. They should also include evidence of contribution, the source of any data and relevant dates, including evidence of personal leadership in the impact of change management and service innovations. National impact through committee membership should reflect the personal contribution and the impact of any output. Membership of committees alone is not sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Further information on evidence that applicants could provide for this domain and some examples can be found in the applicants’ guide.</p>

<h4>Domain 3: education, training, and people development&nbsp;</h4>

<p>In this section, evidence can show contributions to wider education and training across the professions and to patients. If any training or lecturing is externally or separately remunerated, this should be stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do not expect examples for all categories – the list set out below is not exhaustive and further detail can be found in the applicants’ guide. Give evidence of the impact of work that supports the ‘NHS People Plan’ or falls into any of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teaching&nbsp;</li>
  <li>leadership and innovation in training</li>
  <li>educating and informing patients and public</li>
  <li>college or university success in teaching audits</li>
  <li>personal commitment to developing teaching skills</li>

</ul>

<p>Further information on evidence that applicants could provide for this domain and some examples can be found in the applicants’ guide.</p>

<h4>Domain 4: innovation and research&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>

<p>This section is intended to look at innovation and its impact in any relevant setting, and could include more evidence than activities traditionally considered as research. It can include new care pathways that have been developed and implemented, improved ways of working and process efficiencies that have been adopted widely, and have demonstrably made more cost effective use of NHS resources. It can also include benefits of digital technology or other activities from projects with external partners that have demonstrated a benefit to the wider NHS, or that support the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>’s objectives of promoting research for doctors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applicants must be clear what evidence is over-and-above any research, academic or other expectations of their role and give evidence of the wider impact of the research and/or innovation. This includes developing the evidence base for measuring how quality has improved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the section on references, achievements such as published peer reviewed papers should be detailed – not the names of referees. The majority of any publications listed should be from the last 5 years. Evidence should include the relevance of these publications and wider impact they have had. Providing the number of citations each paper has had or its academic score is not sufficient without further explanation of its impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a separate line, applicants should explain what they have achieved to date and how their innovation or research has quantifiably improved health outcomes. They must give supporting evidence.</p>

<p>They should be clear how their research is relevant to the health of patients and the public.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Domain 5: additional national impact&nbsp;</h4>

<p>This domain is an opportunity to provide evidence of wider beneficial impacts that have not been captured elsewhere in the evidence, or to demonstrate how their work has had a wider effect on areas that are national clinical priorities. These aspects may relate to work within their job plan but should demonstrate the national impact over and above the expectations of paid activities. Applicants can include any work for charitable organisations and work which may have more of a patient or public focus, tackling health and workplace inequalities and fostering interprofessional team building or new ways of working. It can also include international work in training and research or recruitment that is of clear benefit to the NHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These can include work on NHS priority or policy areas such as cancer or other areas of outstanding need, health inequalities or disparities.</p>

<p>The detailed applicants’ guide, assessors’ guide and <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> guide will contain further information on the domains and examples of evidence that applicants could provide. We would suggest familiarising yourself with this guidance in order to fully support applicants from within your organisation in line with <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> expectations.</p>

<h2>Part 5: your role as an employer</h2>

<h3>Encouraging applications</h3>

<p>As an employer, you should be playing an active role in encouraging your eligible staff to apply for an award – ensuring that you have paid due consideration to the applications fairly representing the demographics of your eligible membership. Encouraging high performing consultants to make applications for <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> should be discussed at their annual appraisals. We will ask you to confirm you have procedures in place to ensure equality and diversity of your employees to access and be supported for national CIA applications.</p>

<p>The new <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> IT system will allow for better monitoring and reporting on the diversity of applicants for CIAs by organisation. We will be working closely with employers to report on the numbers of applicants and successful applications by organisation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>, working with NHS Employers, have produced resources to assist employers in encouraging eligible consultants to enter applications, and address key concerns and queries. These resources will be available shortly.</p>

<h3>Signing off applications</h3>

<p>When an applicant begins their application, they must identify their NHS employer in order to inform <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> of the chief executive (or nominated deputy) that will be providing the essential sign-off of their application. Academic clinicians or others who have multiple employers should select their main NHS employer, but can add the names of other employers with whom they have employment contracts.</p>

<p>Once the applicant is content with the information they have included within their application, it will be submitted to you for sign-off. Employers are no longer required to rank or score applications. Instead, you will only need to fill the online form confirming whether you are supporting an application, and if not, why – providing your citation. Employer citations primarily serve to confirm that the applicant’s job plan has been agreed, and that they are meeting their contractual obligations as defined in that job plan. If you wish to return the application for revisions before signing off, you will need to provide an explanation first, this will help the applicant address the issues identified before they resubmit.</p>

<p>Your sign-off is required to validate the evidence presented in the 5 domains and confirm to <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> that all the information included is accurate. Without your sign-off, applicants are unable to submit their application, therefore it is important you conduct this process promptly and with sufficient time in advance of the deadline. If an applicant has more than one employer, each employer is expected to contribute or validate the assessment.</p>

<p>You should complete the sign-off for all applicants objectively and should not compare information that is provided with others that you are also supporting. You have a duty of candour and are obliged to inform <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> of any misleading information in the application form. You may wish to refer back to the information provided in Part 4 of this guide. Further information is included in the applicant guide and the assessor guide (which will be available shortly) on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance">application guidance page</a> to inform the sign-off process.</p>

<p>The default sign-off for employers is ‘support’. We would expect all applications to be supported unless there is good reason for not doing so, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fitness to practice</li>
  <li>poor performance</li>
  <li>unresolved complaints</li>
  <li>failure to agree an appropriate job plan</li>
  <li>inaccurate information within the form</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have selected your sign-off option, you must provide a citation with input from any other of the applicant’s employers. if you have decided not to support an application you must explain why here.</p>

<p>Once your sign-off has been completed, the form will return to the applicant. Only they can submit their application to be assessed. <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> will inform the applicant that you have reviewed their application and that they are now required to submit – you may also wish to do your own internal communications with employees to inform them.</p>

<h3>Performance and disciplinary actions</h3>

<p>You should tell us about any factors such as ongoing contractual or professional difficulties.</p>

<p>You must inform us on the application form of any ongoing or upheld investigations or disciplinary procedures against the applicant from the last 5 years. This would include any investigations by external bodies such as the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>, <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> or National Clinical Advisory Service. It would also include any restrictions on practice, complaints against performance or conduct that the employer is formally investigating.</p>

<p>You should inform <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> immediately if an applicant becomes the subject of any such action whilst we are considering the application. We will note any active disciplinary process and await the outcome so that any appropriate action can then be taken in light of any rulings in consultation with you and the applicant as needed.</p>

<p>If your NHS organisation is in special measures, as determined by the Care Quality Commission, your consultants and academic GPs remain eligible to apply for awards. However, in deciding whether to support an application, you should pay particular attention to the contents of the ‘ratings and inspections’ section of their form. In the event that a scoring sub-committee recommends an individual with board-level responsibility, such as an eligible medical director in an organisation in special measures for an award, we will submit a paper to our main committee for decision.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If your organisation is in special measures under the NHS Wales Escalation and Intervention Arrangements, your consultants and academic GPs are eligible to apply for awards.</p>

<p>However, in deciding whether to support an application, you should pay particular attention to the contents of the ‘ratings and inspections’ section of their form.</p>
</div>

<p>Organisations who employ clinical academics should liaise with the appropriate universities to ensure that their views can be considered.</p>

<p>To be eligible for an award, consultants must have an annual appraisal. You will be asked to confirm whether the applicant has had a satisfactory appraisal during the previous 12 months. If an annual appraisal exercise has not taken place, you will need to confirm that the applicant has made reasonable efforts to have an appraisal or that it has been delayed due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Although we do not need information about the appraisal itself, we expect employers to confirm that applicants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participated satisfactorily in the appraisal process</li>
  <li>have fully participated in job planning</li>
  <li>met contractual obligations and complied with the Private Practice Code of Conduct</li>
</ul>

<p>An applicant may have met the required standard of job planning without necessarily having an agreed job plan in place, for example where mediation is taking place.</p>

<p>Employer sign-off must be completed online on the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application portal before the application window closes on 22 June 2022. You should follow the steps below to complete the process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Register on the new <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system – existing employer contacts will be sent a link to register. If you have not been involved in the process before, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>. The main employer contact for the 2022 round should be the person responsible for signing off applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll receive an email stating that a consultant has identified you as their employer – you are required to sign off their application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you’ve logged on, you’ll see the applications that require your validation – review each one objectively in turn. You’ll be required to verify the information within the application by completing the short form. In doing so you must confirm that the applicant is working to professional and personal conduct standards and has had a formal appraisal in the last 12 months agreed a job plan, fulfilled their contractual obligations, and complied with the Private Practice Code of Conduct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must also confirm if you are aware of any disciplinary or professional proceedings or investigations against the applicant, both inside or outside of your organisation, and if so, what they are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll need to confirm whether you ‘support’ the application or not. If not supported, you’ll be asked to explain why. You’ll also need to provide your citation. As set out in Part 3 of this guide, if you’re signing off an application for a consultant who also works for a university (clinical academic),&nbsp;it is <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>’s expectation that both the relevant NHS organisation and university or medical school will be involved in the approval process – including the preparation of any supporting citation. You should ensure that the other employer is content before submitting your citation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you’re content with your sign-off, you should confirm this by submitting it. The applicant will then receive notification that you have validated their application and it is ready for formal submission.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Change in circumstances of current award holders</h3>

<p>You must tell us if an award holder’s circumstances change.</p>

<p>Award holders and their employers must tell us if there are any changes to their employment, as it may affect their award, by filling in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-award-holders-employment-change-notification">change in employment circumstances form</a>.</p>

<p>If they do not tell us when their circumstances change, it could affect whether they can keep their award or what they and your organisation are paid. Any payments made since the change in circumstances may be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Some of the main changes you need to tell us about are set out below – this is not the full list, and you should tell us if anything else significant changes. Award holders should let us know if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they stop practising in the field they got their award</li>
  <li>they change job or employer</li>
  <li>there is a significant change to their job plan – including fewer sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>Award holders should tell us as soon as the change has been agreed locally. We will consider how it affects their award.</p>

<p>If an award holder does get a new job plan, they should send us a copy to consider and approve. If they do not tell us their job plan has changed, it could put their award at risk.</p>

<p>If they no longer meet the criteria in Part 2 of the applicants’ guide, their payments will stop. If they go back to clinical work after a full-time general management role, we may consider reinstating their award after a review.</p>

<h3>Unpaid leave</h3>

<p>We do not pay any awards during unpaid leave. If an award holder takes unpaid leave for more than a year, our medical director will decide whether their award can be reinstated.</p>

<h3>Maternity, parental and adoption leave</h3>

<p>If an award holder takes maternity, parental or adoption leave, they will get their award payments during any period of paid leave from their employer.</p>

<h3>Secondments</h3>

<p>If an award holder is on full time secondment to a post with an employer that does not qualify under the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme, we will suspend their award.</p>

<p>We would advise award holders to speak to their human resources (HR) department before they start their secondment to make arrangements for protecting their award and start collecting it again after their secondment has finished.</p>

<p>If they are on secondment for less than a year, they will resume receipt of their award once the secondment has ended.</p>

<p>We will use the same criteria as we do for people who retire and return to work. This is at the discretion of <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> and each case will be judged on its merits and any precedents.</p>

<h3>Sabbaticals</h3>

<p>If an award holder is planning a sabbatical, they should speak to their HR department and contact us to agree what happens with their award. To retain the award, they must prove their sabbatical will be of benefit to the NHS. If it is not, we will consider suspending their award until they return.</p>

<h3>Prolonged absence from the NHS</h3>

<p>If for any reason an award holder has been on a prolonged absence and not practised their specialty in the NHS for more than a year, we will review whether their award can be reinstated.</p>

<h3>Leaving the NHS during an award round</h3>

<p>To qualify for an award, an applicant must be employed as a consultant in the NHS on 1 April in the award year.</p>

<p>If they are made redundant or they retire during an award round before we announce the award results, we will withdraw their application.</p>

<h3>Pensions and <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> investigations</h3>

<p>Please tell us if an award holder in your organisation retires – including retire and return, or claims their pension</p>

<p>As soon as an award holder is in receipt of any pension payments, they no longer qualify for their legacy national <abbr title="Clinical Excellence Award">CEA</abbr> or <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> covered by the schedule 30 pay protection. This includes payments from the NHS Pension Scheme, University Superannuation Scheme or transferred out benefits. However, if they return to work on a permanent NHS consultant contract, retaining or regaining full registration with a licence to practise, they can apply for a new&nbsp;<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>. For more information, see Part 2 in the applicants’ guide in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-awards-application-guidance/guide-for-applicants-national-clinical-excellence-awards-2021-awards-round">application guidance page</a></p>

<p>They must also tell us the date they retire or claim their pension.</p>

<p><abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are not consolidated with pensions. If an award holder retires with an&nbsp;<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, the award will end. If an award holder retires in receipt of an&nbsp;<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>&nbsp;that is not subject to any transitional NCEA arrangements and returns to work without a gap between employment contracts, we may shorten the period before the&nbsp;<abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>&nbsp;expires. We aim to allow at least a year in a new role, but it will not be extended if it was due to expire within a year of you returning to work. If there’s a gap between retirement and returning employment contracts, the award will cease and the consultant will need to apply for a new award based on work delivered after their return.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must tell us if they start being investigated. As set out in Part 2 of this guide, award holders and their employers must tell us as soon as they know of any investigations, disciplinary procedures or legal action against them.</p>

<p>You must keep us up to date about any developments and the outcomes of any investigations. We will decide if they will affect the application or award. We always use an innocent unless proven otherwise approach.</p>

<h2>Part 6: appeals</h2>

<h3>Appeals for national awards</h3>

<p>All appeals for <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are handled by&nbsp;<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To appeal, applicants will be able to log into their account to begin the relevant processes.</p>

<p>They will be required to tell us why they believe the assessment process was unfair and provide supporting evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>An appeal for a national award must be submitted within 4 weeks of when the appellant was informed of their award results. If our dates change, this will be updated in the portal.</p>

<h3>Reasons an appeal can be requested</h3>

<p>An appeal can be requested if the applicant believes we did not follow the right processes when we assessed their application. An appeal cannot be requested because an applicant disagrees with our judgement.</p>

<p>An appeal can be submitted if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant believes the committee did not consider all the supporting information or documents sent with their application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>irrelevant information was taken into account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant believes they were discriminated against due to characteristics such as gender, ethnicity or age</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the usual evaluation processes were not followed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the committee or any of its members showed bias or had a conflict of interest, such as where someone involved in a decision could be affected by the result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How we handle appeals</h3>

<p>Our chair and medical director will look at the evidence and the processes that were followed to decide if an appeal is justified. They will then ask a panel of 2 sub-committee members – one medical and one non-medical – who were not involved in reviewing the application originally to review their proposed decision to ensure it is robust. If it is decided that there are no grounds for appeal, we will write to the appellant to confirm why. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are grounds for appeal and we cannot resolve the problem informally, we will set up a formal appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A separate panel of people who did not assess the original application or the decision to progress the appeal will consider this. The panel will include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a medical or dental professional</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an employer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a non-professional member as chairperson</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They will look at:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the appeal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the documents that set out our agreed assessment process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a written statement of what the committee did when they considered the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Appellants can see all the documents the panel considers. They can also send more written statements about the appeal and what they believe happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The panel does not usually hear oral evidence. However, an appellant can apply in writing to have an oral hearing. The panel chair will decide whether one would be suitable.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The timeline for appeals</h3>

<p>We try to resolve appeals in line with the process set out below – if there are delays, we will let appellants know.</p>

<h3>If an appeal is successful</h3>

<p>If an appeal is successful, our chair and medical director will consider the best way to put things right. Their decision will be consistent with other similar appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if an appeal against the process is successful, the appellant may not get a new award. If this happens, we will write to you to tell you why.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The national appeals process</h3>

<p>An outline of the process with indicative timelines is set out below:</p>

<p>When we get a request to appeal, we will contact the appellant within 5 working days to acknowledge its receipt.</p>

<p>Our chair and medical director will review the case and decide whether there are grounds for a formal appeal.</p>

<p>Within approximately 20 working days of the date we got in touch, our chair and medical director will let the appellant know if there will be a formal appeal.</p>

<p>If there is a formal appeal, we will set up a panel and agree a date for them to meet, usually within 20 working days.</p>

<p>When our chair and medical director hear what the panel has decided, they will let the appellant know the final decision, usually within 20 working days.</p>

<p>In all cases, the panel’s decision is final.</p>
