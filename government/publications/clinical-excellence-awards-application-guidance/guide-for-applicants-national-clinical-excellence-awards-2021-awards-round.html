<h2>Changes to the application and scoring processes</h2>

<p>Following the 2021 consultation on reform of the national Clinical Excellence Awards, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and the Welsh Government have agreed the following changes will be implemented in a revised scheme as the national Clinical Impact Awards. You can find more information in the full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">consultation response</a>.</p>

<h3>Summary of the changes</h3>

<h4>Increase the number of available awards</h4>

<p>Once the transition process for existing national CEA award holders has completed over the 5-year transitional period, there will be up to 600 awards granted annually in England. National awards and local awards are also planned to be held concurrently – this is being reviewed throughout the transition period.</p>

<h4>Re-brand the scheme</h4>

<p>The awards have been re-branded as the national Clinical Impact Awards to reflect to applicants and scorers that the primary focus of the awards is the output of activities, rather than undertaking activities in the absence of describing their impact and results.</p>

<h4>Re-structure the award levels</h4>

<p>In England, the scheme now operates as a three-level award system: national 1 (lowest), national 2 and national 3 (highest). </p>

<h4>Refresh the assessment domains</h4>

<p>The assessment domains have been revised to combine both Delivering and Developing Service into a single new domain (domain 1). Three domains (domains 2, 3 and 4) have been renumbered and their emphases amended and a new fifth domain has been introduced to allow applicants to include evidence of national impact from other unpaid activities, or where they have delivered impact over and above expectations.</p>

<h4>Simplify the application process</h4>

<p>A single level application process has been introduced so applicants no longer apply for an award at a specific level. This enables applicants to gain higher level awards on first application based on the score they attain. </p>

<h4>Remove pro-rated awards</h4>

<p>Those working less than full time (<abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr>) will no longer have their post 2022 award payments pro-rated. </p>

<h4>Remove the renewals process</h4>

<p>The renewals process has been removed. National Clinical Impact Awards will be held for a total of 5 years, at which point applicants need to re-apply. </p>

<h4>Remove the pensionability of awards</h4>

<p>National Clinical Impact Awards are no longer pensionable or consolidated. </p>

<h4>Simplify the process for employers</h4>

<p>Employers only need to indicate their support or their lack of support for an application and provide a citation for each applicant. Employer scoring and ranking are no longer required.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There are some differences if you are based in Wales.</p>

<p>All the above changes apply except for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of awards – proportionate to the size of the consultant workforce and the level of commitment awards, successful applicants in Wales will hold up to 37 awards granted per year once the transition process has completed</li>
  <li>the structure of awards levels – the scheme will continue with four levels: level 0, level 1, level 2 and level 3</li>
  <li>concurrent awards – consultants will be able to access both commitment awards and hold a national Clinical Impact Award at the same time from 2022 onwards</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-the-national-clinical-excellence-awards-scheme">find out more in the consultation response</a>.</p>

<h3>How we’ve streamlined our application process</h3>

<p>We’ve streamlined our processes to make applying for an award simpler.</p>

<p>We have removed the additional forms for evidence and increased the character limit on the main form to 2,000 characters for all domains. So, you only need to submit one form for scoring. We have adapted the references section in the new domain 4 – innovation and research, to remove any character limit.</p>

<p>We have reduced the list of accredited national nominating bodies and specialist societies to reduce duplication within and across specialties. All accredited ranking organisations will now be known as national nominating organisations (<abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr>), amending and rebalancing the number of ranking places available to each specialty, in proportion to the number of eligible consultants. Each applicant can now only have one ranking and citation from one relevant <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>.</p>

<p>We have removed the option to seek third-party citations. Citations are only possible from the list of <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> for those applicants ranked by them, in their prioritisation exercises.</p>

<p>We will evaluate the number of applications to be scored in each region and continue to adjust scoring groups and numbers across regions to balance the workload and optimise committee diversity. This will ensure enough scorers are available to assess each application.</p>

<p>Regional subcommittee scoring continues, with each region being given an indicative number of awards at each level (N1/N2/N3) to retain the equity of regional opportunity for success. This continues to be based on the number of awards available nationally and the number of applications received. Applications tied at the cut off for the lower limit of N1, or tied between N1 and N2, will be rescored at NRES, as will any applications identified through national governance review.</p>

<p>To decide which applicants gain an N3 award, each region’s highest scoring applicants constituting twice their N3 indicative number, will be pooled nationally and rescored by the N3 Committee to determine those most deserving of the highest-level national award. Those who are unsuccessful at N3 will be recommended for an N2 award.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The transitional arrangements are only applicable to applicants in England. In Wales there are no transitional arrangements, however, award holders may still be eligible for pension protection and should contact their employer in the first instance for further information.</p>
</div>

<p>In 2018, the government approved Schedule 30 of the 2003 consultant contract, negotiated and agreed between NHS employers and the BMA. This provides transitional pay protection where a new national scheme has lower award values. This protection is costly, peaking at over £30 million in 2025/26. As the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme must stay within the agreed budget, pay protection has an impact on the funding available for new awards in the transitional period. Details of pay protection arrangements for existing NCEA holders applying for, and successfully gaining, their first <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> can be found in Schedule 30.</p>

<p>Applicants should review this carefully and discuss their personal circumstances with their employers if they have any questions. Any questions relating to awards that employers cannot answer can be put to <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The cost of pay protection means we have altered some elements of the scheme for the transitional period. These elements will be reviewed periodically, and any necessary adjustments will be made each year. For example, local awards and national awards cannot be held at the same time yet, and the numbers of <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> made available at each level may vary during the transition period.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>

<h3>About <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> and the Clinical Impact Awards Scheme</h3>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>) runs the national Clinical Impact Awards scheme for the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) in England.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee provides governance for the awards for the Welsh Government in Wales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Health ministers agree a limited number of new awards each year, so the selection process is very competitive.</p>

<p>You can apply for a new award at any time after you have completed a full year in an eligible role. If you already hold a Clinical Excellence Award, transitional arrangements apply between the old and the new schemes.</p>

<p>To be considered, you need to show what you have delivered that has had an impact at a national level, over and above the expectations defined in your job plan, in developing and delivering a high-quality service. You also need to demonstrate your commitment to, and nationally relevant impact on, improving the NHS through leadership, education, training, people development, and innovation and research. You can also provide evidence of national impact in areas that are not captured in these 4 domains, particularly if it relates to published NHS or other relevant health objectives. In all of the domains, you should consider providing evidence of national impact relating to equality, diversity and inclusion.</p>

<p>There is one online application form for all awards, so every applicant can highlight their contributions in the same way.</p>

<p>Based on the strength of applications, our regional sub-committees and our Main committee will recommend applicants for national awards to health ministers, for them to approve.</p>

<h3>How national awards relate to local awards</h3>

<p>The aim for the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme is to allow local and national awards to be held concurrently, but due to the costs of transitional pay protection explained above, this is not possible straightaway, so in 2022 they are not being held at the same time. This will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Local award schemes are managed by individual employers in England, more information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/" rel="external">NHS Employers</a> website.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, employers give commitment awards. You can find more about these in the amended <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/Documents/433/Nat_Consultant_Contract.pdf" rel="external">National Consultant Contract in Wales 2003</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>National awards are awarded by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>. They recognise the national impact of work undertaken over and above contractual or other paid activities, in the NHS in England and Wales. They specifically recognise the dissemination and implementation of that work and its impact on the wider NHS and on public health. You do not need to hold any local award to be eligible to apply for a national award.</p>

<p>There are 3 levels of national award in England: N1, N2 and N3 – N3 is the highest award.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Four award levels are available in Wales, with N0 being added as a lowest level to account for a Welsh-only level  that differs from that in England.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h3>What the national scheme rewards</h3>

<p>The scheme rewards consultants or academic GPs who deliver national impact above the expectations of their job role or other paid work. If you apply, you need to give evidence of impact across the following 5 domains:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Delivering and developing a high-quality service&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leadership&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Education, training and people development&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovation and research&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other areas of national impact, with specific reference to NHS priorities, where relevant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These 5 domains are explained in Part 5 of this guide.</p>

<p>We do not give awards for standalone overseas work.</p>

<p>Work in other countries is not directly relevant for an award, so we cannot consider it on its own, but if you can show your overseas work has helped the NHS and the health of the public directly or has had a direct reputational benefit for the NHS overseas, it may be supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How we assess your application</h3>

<p>We run the scheme fairly and openly, offering every applicant an equal opportunity, and we consider all applications on merit. We include our analysis of each year’s competition in our annual report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We assess all applications against the same criteria, which you can find in Part 5 of this guide. You can also find also detailed guidance for assessors on how to judge applications against these criteria on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards">our home page</a>.</p>

<p>Our sub-committees are regional groups that assess applications for national awards for most applicants in their area. Based on application workload and to provide balance and a degree of external scrutiny across these committees, we reallocate some sub-committee members to score in other regions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 13 regional <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> sub-committees in England:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cheshire and Mersey&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p>The sub-committees consider all applications in their area, except for those from public health consultants and academic GPs contracted by Public Health England and NHS England. These are assessed by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or arm’s length body (<abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>) sub-committee, where they can be benchmarked more easily. Each regional sub-committee is allocated an indicative number of awards at each level. This is based on the number of national awards available, proportionately distributed based on the number of applications received that year, in each region. This means there is an equal opportunity of achieving an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> in any region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sub-committee members come from a range of backgrounds, with experience and expertise in many different areas. They assess and score applications independently. All the individual scores for an application are averaged and then ranked against the other applications in that region. The top-scoring applications in each region are provisionally allocated an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>. To ensure the highest-level awards are granted to those making the greatest national impact, a separate N3 subcommittee will rescore all those from each region falling within the N3 indicative allocation, plus the same number of applicants scoring highest in the N2 allocation. This rescoring provides a national benchmarking for determining who receives an N3 award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each sub-committee is typically made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>50% – medical and dental professionals&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25% – non-medical professionals / lay members&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25% – employers&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each sub-committee is normally divided into scoring groups to manage the workload. We ensure there is equivalent diversity of scorers across these groups. These groups score a randomly selected group of applications, to minimise any unconscious bias affecting the scoring.</p>

<p>Each group scores applications consistently against the guidance. We expect there to be up to 600 new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> available each year in England, subject to ministerial agreement and funding impacts during the transitional period. Our ambition is to award 330 x N1, 200 x N2 and 70 x N3 awards each year at a value of £20,000, £30,000, and £40,000 respectively.</p>

<p>If you successfully gain an award, it will last 5 years, backdated to 1 April 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, the process for assessing applicants is different. Please contact Chantelle Herbert or Darren Lewis at the Wales Secretariat for more details, on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HSSWorkforceOD@gov.wales">HSSWorkforceOD@gov.wales</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>After regional sub-committee scoring has closed and the ranked list has been produced, our chair and medical director review all the provisionally successful N1 and N2 applications that are not being considered for an N3 award. After their review, applications where questions arise, or clarification may be helpful, are discussed at the regional sub-committee meetings as part of our quality and governance review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Applications that are tied at the cut-off point for N1 or between N1 and N2 awards are automatically referred for rescoring by the National Reserve Sub-committee (NRES). Applications where questions have not been resolved are also referred to NRES for rescoring. NRES is made up of the chairs and medical vice-chairs of the regional sub-committees, plus other experienced scorers from the regions. As a panel of our most experienced scorers, NRES acts as a quality assurance mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our chair and medical director recommend applications for awards to our Main Committee, based on the sub-committee and NRES scores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following scrutiny from our Main Committee, English recommendations go to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> ministers.</p>

<p>Recommendations from the Wales sub-committee go to Welsh ministers for final approval after scrutiny from Main Committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your award is approved, we will let you and your employer know.</p>

<h3>Local awards and commitment awards</h3>

<p>We do not have any say in local awards in England or commitment awards in Wales. For more information about these awards, please contact your employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>If you have a disability</h3>

<p>In line with the Equality Act 2010, employers must consider making reasonable adjustments for employees with disabilities. These are changes to things such as equipment or processes to make sure people with disabilities can do their job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a disability, please include details about any reasonable adjustments you have agreed with your employer in your job plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We treat all applications equally and use the same scoring criteria for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Extenuating circumstances</h3>

<p>If there are extenuating circumstances you believe may affect your ability to submit a successful application, please let us know as soon as possible before the application closing date, so we can support you and make sure your application is considered fairly. We cannot take any extenuating circumstances into account after you have submitted your application and it has been scored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each case is treated on its own merits, and the outcomes from each one are based on the rules relating to the current scheme. If you apply for an award and believe there are extenuating circumstances, you can describe these in the job plan, personal statement and/or relevant domains of the application form. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We understand that it can be difficult to share personal information. Our assessors receive specialist training on how to consider these types of circumstances, and any information you share will be treated with respect and in confidence. Extenuating circumstances should not put you off applying – let us know about them so the sub-committee can take them into account in the scoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements for people with existing national Clinical Excellence Awards</h3>

<p>With the introduction of a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme from 2022, existing national CEA holders are subject to prior CEA rules for their awards and their tenure. There is a transitional period based on previously agreed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsemployers.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/Schedule-30-March-2021_0.pdf" rel="external">Schedule 30 arrangements</a> for national CEA holders applying for a first new award.</p>

<p>The following rules apply to existing national CEA holders:&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you apply for a first new award before your national CEA would have been due for renewal under the old scheme and are unsuccessful, you keep your existing CEA until its expiry. You may apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> again up to the year before your CEA’s expiry. If your CEA would have been due for renewal and you are unsuccessful, the reversion arrangements to receive a legacy, pensionable local CEA will continue to apply. The level of the local award depends on the score you get in your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you apply in the year your NCEA expires, your NCEA will lapse before the annual <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> award round is completed and you will not be eligible for the transition arrangements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you apply in the year your NCEA would have been due for renewal and successfully gain a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> will start when your NCEA expires. The value of legacy CEAs and its pensionable benefits are protected for the duration of your first new award at an equivalent level.</p>

<p>If you apply at any other time before your NCEA expires and you successfully gain a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> will start on 1 April following your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> application. If you gain an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> at an equivalent or higher level to your national CEA, the payment you get will be no less than the payment of your existing national CEA. If you gain an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> at a lower equivalent level you will receive no less than the legacy national CEA payment at that level. You will have to accept your new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> and give up any unexpired NCEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The equivalent levels are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>N1 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to silver CEA&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>N2 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to gold CEA&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>N3 <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> – equivalent to platinum CEA&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any CEA award holders who enter the transitional arrangements will not be eligible for LCEA payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Initially, due to the cost of the transitional arrangements, <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> holders are not eligible for local awards in England at the same time, whether or not they held a prior national CEA. This will be reviewed during and after the transition period to see when national and local awards can be held concurrently. There’s more about this in the government response to the consultation.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Check you are eligible</h2>

<h3>Who can apply for an award</h3>

<p>You can apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> if you are a fully registered medical or dental practitioner on the General Dental Council (<abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>) specialist list or General Medical Council (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>) specialist list, or GP register.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be fully registered with a licence to practise&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have been a permanent NHS consultant or academic GP in a permanent clinical academic role in higher education at the same level as a senior lecturer or above</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must have met both of these conditions for at least one year, on 1 April in the award year.</p>

<p>The year does not include time spent as a locum, but you can give evidence from your achievements as a locum in the same role. For consultants in a locum role for more than one year, we may consider you eligible for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> if your employer confirms you are employed on terms consistent with a permanent consultant contract.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all cases, you must be on an NHS consultant contract expressed in programmed activities (<abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>), or on an academic contract expressed in an equivalent pay scale.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Consultants working in Wales must be on an NHS consultant contract expressed in Sessions or on an academic contract expressed in an equivalent pay scale.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re not sure about your eligibility, please contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Qualifying criteria</h4>

<p>You will qualify if you are any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employed by an NHS organisation (in England or Wales), <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or its arm’s length bodies, the Welsh Government or similarly associated Welsh Government organisations, a university, medical or dental school, or local authority.&nbsp;Applications from employees of other organisations may be eligible, including those on consultant contracts providing contracted out NHS services. Please contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a> before you apply, if you need any clarification</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In Wales, you will also qualify if you are employed by similar Welsh Government-associated organisations.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>an academic GP, if your responsibilities are the same as consultant clinical academic staff and you are fully registered with a licence to practise. You can apply for awards if you:
    <ul>
      <li>work at least half your hours as an academic GP</li>
      <li>are a practising clinician providing some direct NHS services</li>
      <li>do at least 5 <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr> or equivalent sessions that help the NHS, including teaching and clinical research</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a consultant or a dental practitioner with an honorary NHS contract, who is fully registered with a licence to practise. Whether you qualify for an award does not only depend on your contribution to the NHS in the provision of direct patient care. If you are a full-time academic consultant, you will qualify for an award if you carry out at least 5 programmed clinical activities or equivalent sessions that help the NHS. This includes teaching, training and clinical research. An applicant who works less than full time and does fewer than 3 programmed clinically relevant activities (<abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>) is not eligible to apply for an award</li>
  <li>a fully registered public health consultant on the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> specialist register, or on the <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> specialist list, with a licence to practise</li>
  <li>a postgraduate dean, fully registered with the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>, with a licence to practise, who competed for the role against GPs and consultants, and is responsible for postgraduate trainees across all specialties</li>
  <li>a consultant or academic GP later employed as a dean or head of school in medicine or dentistry, fully registered with the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>, with a licence to practise. You can apply for an award based on your work in this post</li>
  <li>a consultant, fully registered with the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>, with a licence to practise, working as an NHS trust clinical or medical director, or a similar level medical manager post. If you are not sure if you are eligible, please contact us and we will assess your contractual contribution over-and-above your expected duties, as well as your contractual status. If the majority of your work is in a management role, you can still qualify if you have an active consultant contract with a specific clinical, or clinical leadership, role and continue to renew your licence to practise. If you move into general management and/or have a management contract outside the consultant pay scale, you are not eligible to apply for an award</li>
</ul>

<p>As an NHS consultant, it does not make a difference if you have agreed to national terms and conditions of service, or other terms with an individual trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence runs its own award scheme, but we also recognise eligible NHS employee contributions, over-and-above the expected standards, to military medical and dental services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you work less than full-time (<abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr>), you can apply for an award if you undertake a minimum of 3 clinically relevant contractual <abbr title="programmed activities">PAs</abbr>. If you are eligible based on this minimum PA requirement and are successful, we will pay you the full award, but if you are <abbr title="less than full time">LTFT</abbr> and in a transition provision from a national CEA based on legacy award values, you will receive a pro-rated award.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Retirement: things you need to let us know</h3>

<p>If you retire during an awards round before we announce the results, we will take this to mean that you have withdrawn your application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your national CEA would have been due to renew in 2022 and you expect to retire up to 6 months after your award is due to expire in March 2023, we may consider extending your award, without you having to apply for a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>. Please tell us your actual retirement date before the 2022 awards round closes on 22 June 2022. We will need to confirm if your award will be valid until you retire. If your retirement plans change, please let us know as soon as possible, as we may need to review or withdraw your award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National CEA awards are consolidated with your pension, which means it is taken into account when your pension is calculated. These awards stop when you retire or claim your pension. If you take all or part of your pension (from the NHS Pension Scheme, Universities Superannuation Scheme or transferred-out benefits), you do not qualify for your existing award. If you return to work on a permanent NHS consultant contract, retaining or regaining full registration with a licence to practise, you can apply for a new <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are not consolidated with pensions. If you retire with an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, your award will end as you are no longer eligible. If you retire in receipt of an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> that is not subject to any transitional NCEA arrangements and you return to work without a gap between your employment and your new contract, we may shorten the period before your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> expires. We will aim to allow you at least a year in your new role to retain your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, but it will not be extended if it was due to expire within a year of you returning to work. If there is a gap between your retirement and returning employment contracts, your award will cease and you will need to apply for a new award based on work delivered after you returned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you hold an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> and expect to retire up to 6 months after your award is due to expire, we will not extend your existing award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> when you come back to work, we will only consider your achievements since your new contract started. We will not consider evidence you used to apply for your last award, evidence from before your new contract date, or evidence that is not clearly dated. If you are continuing the work you were doing before you retired, please tell us and make it clear what you have achieved since you started your new contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you did not have a national award when you retired, you can still apply for an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Reasons you may not be eligible for an award</h3>

<p>You are not eligible to apply for an award if you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not on the consultant pay scale as expressed in programmed activities or an equivalent&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a locum consultant – if you become a permanent consultant, you can potentially use evidence from your locum role in your application, if it is relevant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a consultant who primarily works in general management, such as a chief executive, general manager, chief operating officer, or a senior university office-holder, without a specific clinical role&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not fully registered with a licence to practise.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Investigations into your work and disciplinary or legal action against you can affect your award or application. This includes interim, temporary, or final court orders, or penalties relating to your professional or personal conduct that may reflect badly on your judgement, or the expected standards of the profession. You must let us know about any investigations or sanctions by your employer or professional regulator (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> / <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>) and their progression, interim and final decisions and any sanctions. We will look at each case individually, but we may remove your award if there are adverse outcomes following investigations or disciplinary measures, or if we believe you have failed to notify us appropriately, or in a timely manner. If this happens, you will need to pay back any over payments. See Part 3 for more details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We ask about your organisation’s latest inspection outcome. If you work in a trust in special measures, we expect you to comment on any relevance of this to your role. We will also ask your employer to check that they are happy with your response when they sign off your application. If you are on the board of a trust in special measures and you are recommended for an award, we will inform our Main Committee.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Part 3: How to apply</h2>

<h3>Filling in your application</h3>

<p>You must fill in your own application form – nobody else can do it for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the application window opens on 27 April 2022, you will need to apply online at the new <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application portal.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to draft and amend your application before you apply by downloading a copy of the form, this will be available shortly on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> home page</a>.</p>

<p>When you apply, please select the NHS or arm’s length body that holds your substantive or honorary contract, and your specialty, so that the right subcommittee considers your application. If you give the wrong trust or organisation, your application may not be considered for an award. If you are employed by more than one body, please state all of your employers, being clear which is your main employer based on your salary.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Getting support for your application</h3>

<p>We cannot accept applications without sign-off from your employer(s). They will need to complete the shortened part 2 of your application. This requires joint sign-off from all employers if you have more than one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you work for a university, the chief executive of the trust where you hold an honorary contract, or their nominated deputy, should complete this section. It is <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>’s expectation that both the relevant NHS organisation and the university or medical school will be involved in the approval process, and the preparation of any supporting citation, and that an up-to-date job plan has been agreed by both parties – please see the following section for further information.</p>

<p>If you are applying for a new award, you can seek support from a Royal College or society that you are a member of. Our list of approved nominating organisations will be available shortly on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards"><abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> home page</a>.</p>

<p>They may choose to rank your application in comparison with other applicants and provide you with a supporting citation. If you plan to seek such support, we recommend that you contact the relevant organisation in good time, to establish what their processes involve and their timelines. You are only allowed to have a ranking or endorsement from one <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>. If you seek endorsement from more than one <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> it is your responsibility to be transparent with them. Only two <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> can be selected and only the first <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> submitting a ranking will be accepted. If you have not notified the second <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> of your acceptance of the first ranking and receive two <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> rankings and citations in the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> system, you will not be able to submit your application until you reject one of these. If you delay letting the second <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> know, you may waste one of their <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> ranking spaces and deny someone else the opportunity to have a ranking and citation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> and employers are expected to have processes that ensure equality and diversity. They should have a balanced representation of applicants from their consultant staff for employers, from their membership and from the wider specialty for <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How appraisals fit into the process</h3>

<p>To qualify for an award, you must have an annual appraisal. Your employer must confirm whether you have done this in the 12 months before your application. If you have not, they should confirm you tried to have an appraisal. We recognise that your appraisal may have been delayed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic or another exceptional situation – if this is the case, they need to state the reasons why no appraisal took place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We do not need information about the appraisal, but your employer must confirm that you:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>took part in the appraisal process&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>took part in job planning&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>met the terms of your contract&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>followed the ‘Private Practice Code of Conduct’ where relevant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may have met the standard for job planning even if you do not have an agreed job plan. For example, if mediation is taking place. Explain this to your employer if they are delaying their sign-off for this reason.</p>

<h3>Telling us about investigations or disciplinary action</h3>

<p>On your application form, you must tell us if:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you are being investigated about your work by your employer, the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are going through disciplinary procedures&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>successful legal action has been taken against you for your clinical practice, where you admitted responsibility or were found guilty in court&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are any civil or legal proceedings against you which reflect upon your behaviour, judgement or professional standing and may subsequently be referred to the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> / <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have faced any of these things in the last 5 years</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The information you need to give includes:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any investigations by external bodies, such as <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>, <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> or the National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS)&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>restrictions on your practice&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>complaints against your performance or behaviour that your employer is formally investigating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the results of any finished investigations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will record this information, but it will not be available to assessors and will not have a negative effect on your score.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For live investigations, we use an ‘innocent unless proven otherwise’ approach. We may choose to wait until the investigations are over to review the outcome of your application. If we do this and then give you an award, we will backdate it to when it would have been awarded, if we did not wait until the end of the investigations.</p>

<p>If you start to be investigated or to go through disciplinary procedures after you apply, and before we announce the awards, you must tell us immediately.</p>

<p>If you do not tell us about any such issues, we will be concerned about your commitment to transparency and we reserve the right to cancel your application or withdraw your award.</p>

<h3>The timetable for national awards</h3>

<p>You must submit your online national Clinical Excellence application to us by 5pm on 22 June 2022. You will not be able to apply after this, regardless of the reason that you missed the deadline.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>

<h3>Things to do when you apply</h3>

<p>Start your application early enough to allow time to get sign off from your employer and engage with any relevant local trust, nominating organisation or university pre-selection processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you fill in your application form, follow the steps in this guide.</p>

<p>Give clear dates for your achievements – if the dates are not clear, it will bring your score down.</p>

<p>Concentrate on evidence from the last 5 years and make it clear what you have achieved since any prior award and how your work has progressed since then.</p>

<p>If your last award was less than 5 years ago, give evidence since your last award and be clear about what you have achieved since then.</p>

<p>If your last award was more than 5 years ago, concentrate on evidence from the last 5 years.</p>

<p>Do not repeat information from old applications – assessors compare new and previous applications and will check for repeated information.</p>

<p>Write society and group names in full – avoid acronyms because subcommittee members reading the application may not be familiar with them. The same applies to other ‘medical’ abbreviations, such as those used for diseases, operative procedures, or diagnostic techniques.</p>

<p>Give measurable information such as outcome data wherever you can and quote the dates, source and relevant benchmarks.</p>

<p>You must explain the impact you had. Simply holding a position such as an ‘officer’ in a college or specialist society, will not in itself justify an award – the national impact needs to be clear.</p>

<p>Use a new line for each entry, and consider using bullet points to make the information clearer and easier to read.</p>

<p>Check your employer’s email address with your NHS trust administrator before you fill in their details.</p>

<p>You cannot sign your application electronically, so please type your name in the relevant box.</p>

<p>We may ask for more information if anything is unclear in your application</p>

<p>If there are special circumstances that could affect your application, like ill health, tell us as soon as possible before the deadline, as we may consider extending your award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Each step of your application</h3>

<h4>Step 1 – sign in</h4>

<p>Once the application window opens on 27 April, Go to <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> application portal and register. Because the&nbsp;application portal is new, you need to select ‘new to the system’ and complete the form as a ‘Contact of an Existing Employer’, even if you’ve registered before. If your employer is not listed, contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>. You will get an email with your login details and be asked to set up a password.</p>

<h4>Step 2 – privacy notice</h4>

<p>You need to agree to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-clinical-excellence-awards/about/personal-information-charter">how we collect, process and store your information</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 3 – start your application</h4>

<p>Select ‘Apply for a Clinical Impact Award’ and the ‘2022 Award Round’ &nbsp;or ‘In Progress’ application if you are logging in again to continue editing.&nbsp;We are still in the process of migrating data to the new system, so if you have any current awards they may not show in the ‘Historical Awards’ tab yet.</p>

<h4>Step 4 – ask for support from a national nominating organisation (<abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>)</h4>

<p>If you know which <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> you want to ask to support your application, specify them here – or you can add them later. Things to take into account when approaching an <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> for support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you can enter up to 2 <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> but only one can support you, so if you enter 2 you’ll need to remove one before you submit your application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you still need to approach the <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> you specify to ask for their support through their process&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> can enter the details of their support after you submit your application – you don’t need their input as part of your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> cannot access applications which don’t include a request for support, so as well as asking an <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr> directly, you must include a request in your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you wish to change the <abbr title="National Nominating Organisations">NNOs</abbr> after you’ve selected them, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 5 – complete your applicant profile</h4>

<p>This information is for our monitoring purposes. Some information is not visible to scorers to minimise any unconscious or other bias. You need to add your:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>personal and contact details&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> and/or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> registration&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>current employment details for your primary NHS employer and primary non-NHS employer, if you have one&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pension scheme membership and if you are an academic/teaching consultant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>accredited speciality and any sub-specialities if relevant&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>background and diversity details&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can save your work at any time using the button in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>When you are ready&nbsp;to submit your application, you need to click the bottom right corner to submit your profile.</p>

<h4>Step 6 – your application details</h4>

<p>Complete the ‘Details’ tab with the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your consultant appointments in date order&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the year you were appointed to consultant grade&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your primary medical qualification and the year and institution&nbsp;where you gained it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any post-graduate qualifications stating the year you qualified and which institution you studied at&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any current national award, and which level&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you received a new national Clinical Excellence Award at any level in 2018 or 2019</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your registration and licencing status&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your personal statement along with your permission for us to publish it, if you are successful&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if your primary employer is in England or Wales&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have taken any part of your pension or retired and returned to work, giving us the dates that you did so&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if your most recent national award was withdrawn&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you are also applying for a local award in 2022&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Save your work frequently using the button at the bottom of the page. You will need to have completed all the mandatory fields before you can submit your application.</p>

<h4>Step 7 – your job plan</h4>

<p>Use the ‘Job Plan’ tab to tell us:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of direct clinical care, academic, supporting professional activities, and planned programmed activities that are specified in your agreed job plan&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the activities you do for each of your programmed activities, including any changes&nbsp;in the last 5 years&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other sessions&nbsp;you are paid for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any sessions you are not paid for&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any additional income from any wider role outside your job plan – if you have additional income, explain&nbsp;how it relates to the evidence in your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 8 – domains</h4>

<p>Provide your evidence for each of the 5 domains. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Domain 1: delivering and developing a high quality service</li>
  <li>Domain 2: leadership&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Domain 3: education, training and people development&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Domain 4: innovation and research – this should include up to 10 of your most significant publications, whether web-based or multi-media outputs, and up to 5 reviews and textbooks&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Domain 5: additional national impact –&nbsp;here, tell us about high-quality work with nationally or internationally recognised impact that has a direct benefit to the NHS&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more detail on what a good submission for each domain looks like and some helpful examples in Part 5 of this guide.</p>

<h4>Step 9 – ratings and inspections</h4>

<p>Here we need to know if your employer has been inspected by either the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England or Health Education and Improvement Wales (HEIW) in Wales, and if so, the date of the inspection, the rating and your role in the ratings and any improvement plans.</p>

<p>If they have not been inspected or have been rated differently, tell us the details.</p>

<p>You will need to confirm that the information you have is provided is accurate to the best of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Step 10 – submit your application for review by your employer</h4>

<p>Click ‘Submit’ in the bottom right corner to send your application to your employer. If you work for a university, this should be the nominated person at the trust where you hold an honorary contract, that you named in Step 1.</p>

<p>Your employer will be asked to confirm:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if your application is supported or not supported – if it is not supported, they will be asked to explain why&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that you are working to professional and personal conduct standards&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that you have had a formal appraisal in the last 12 months agreed a job plan, fulfilled your contractual obligations, and complied with the Private Practice Code of Conduct&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they are aware of any disciplinary or professional proceedings or investigations inside or outside the trust – if so what they are&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They will also be asked to provide a citation commenting on the merits of your application and your work towards meeting the trust’s objectives&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your employer feels there should be any changes before they complete their section, they can return your application to you. If they do this you will receive notes explaining their reasoning.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Step 11 – review your employer’s section</h4>

<p>Once your employer has completed their section they will send your application back to you to review. If you feel your employer’s section needs amending, discuss any proposed changes with them and contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 12 – submit your application</h4>

<p>When all sections, including the employer section, are complete, you are ready to submit your application. After you submit it you cannot change it so please check that you only have one request for support from an <abbr title="National Nominating Organisation">NNO</abbr>. You will not be able to submit your application if you have more than one, so you will need to reject one to continue.</p>

<p>If you find that you need to change something after it’s submitted, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Step 13 – after submission</h4>

<p>Once your application is submitted, it will move from ‘In Progress’ to ‘Submitted’ on the landing page when you log into your account again.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Part 4: Applying for a new award</h2>

<p>Awards are granted for 5 years. You may apply at any time during the tenure of your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> award, but you cannot resubmit anything that has already been assessed. If you do not get a new award, you keep your existing <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> and if you do get one, you are obliged to accept it and give up any unexpired <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, even if the new award is at a lower level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be sent a reminder to apply for a new award in the year your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> ends. Your <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> will expire in the year of the award round and payments will end on 31 March. Any payment for a subsequent award will be backdated to the expiry date of your prior award if you are successful. If you are not successful, no further <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> payments will be made until you gain a new award, when payments will be backdated to 1 April of the year that your application is successful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We rely on you to maintain an up-to-date email address in your <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> record. It is your responsibility to apply for your renewal at the right time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can review awards at any time. For example, if:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you make significant changes to your job or job plan</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you face disciplinary action from external bodies like the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>, <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr> or NCAS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are taken to court and found guilty.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must inform <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> about any circumstances such as these.</p>

<h2>Part 5: How your application is scored</h2>

<h3>Evidence of how your work has positively impacted the NHS in England or Wales</h3>

<p>Clinical impact is about providing high-quality services to patients that go beyond your immediate remit, that improve clinical outcomes for as many patients as possible, use resources efficiently and make national services more productive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You need to show assessors evidence of how you made these services more efficient and productive, and improved quality at the same time, as well as demonstrating your role as an enabler and leader of health provision, prevention and policy development and implementation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assessors need to be sure your achievements are relevant. They need to know when they occurred, or if you are still doing these activities. It is essential that you make the dates of your achievements clear, as without dates they cannot be scored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use the ‘Domain’ section of the application form to give details of your achievements, as this is where they will be assessed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the ‘Domain’ section:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you do not need to show you have achieved over-and-above expected standards in all 5 domains – a lot will depend on the type and nature of your post&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you could get a national award based on an excellent local or regional contribution, if it has been disseminated and had an impact on the wider NHS&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you should highlight the most important examples of your work focusing on its national and international impacts&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>describe the impact you have had in any roles you list, including acknowledging the contribution of colleagues and other members of the multi-professional team&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make it clear when your roles started and ended, or if they are ongoing</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>List your achievements against the original aims in your job plan or personal development plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not include evidence you gave for an earlier award – unless it shows how you have built on or consolidated your previous achievements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give quantified data, particularly outcome measures, that:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>show what you have achieved since your last award, or over the last 5 years&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include relevant dates, sources, and appropriate benchmarks</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If your work is subject to national audit processes, include this information, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Committee members score the domain sections as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>10 = your application is excellent with clear and sustained, national and or international impact&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 = your work is over-and-above your contract terms and should have at least a regional impact, beyond your local area&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 = you have met the terms of your contract or may have contributed more, but mainly within your locality&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>0 = you have not met the terms of your contract, or there is not enough information to make a judgement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What to include in each domain</h3>

<p>There are 5 domains. Group your achievements in line with each one and avoid repetition across domains, unless the evidence shows different aspects of your work that is relevant to the domain. In all cases, you must include dates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recognise the extraordinary requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the work that many consultants, academic GPs and multiple other healthcare workers have contributed. You may choose to include evidence related to this as part of your evidence over prior years. If you do, concentrate on the impact of your contributions over-and-above your expected role where it has had an impact outside of your immediate remit.</p>

<p>We recognise how important redeployment and extended hours and remits have been in COVID-19, and that these are broadly universal across the NHS. Recognition will also be given for efforts made to maintain other key clinical services, research activities, and teaching and training during the COVID-19 pandemic period. While local work related to COVID-19 was essential, it is likely to be scored higher where you can demonstrate how it has had broad, and ideally, national impact. Remember to include other relevant work across the entire 5-year period in each domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Domain 1: delivering and developing a high-quality service</h3>

<p>In this section, give evidence of what you have achieved in relation to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>providing and developing a safe service with measurable, effective clinical outcomes, based on delivery of high technical and clinical standards of service that provide a good experience for patients, and how you have cascaded this more widely to colleagues who have implemented improvements based on your experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consistently looking for, and introducing, ways to improve your service; sharing the learning and seeing it embedded in practice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Explain which activities relate to your clinical services where you are paid by the NHS, and to other aspects of your work as a consultant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Include quantified measures if you can – like outcome data. These need to reflect the whole service you and your multi-professional team provide and how you have collectively disseminated your experience. Use validated indicators for quality improvement or quality standards, and other reference data sources in England, or the Health and Care Standards for Wales, ideally providing performance data against benchmark or national indicators for your specialty, showing local and wider improvements as a result of your work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For good patient experience, show how you ensured your patients are cared for with compassion, integrity, and dignity, and how you have demonstrated commitment to their safety and wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your evidence could show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your excellent standards for dealing with patients, relatives, and staff. Surveys or collated 360-degree feedback to validate your evidence of your patients’ quality care, and how you communicated it to colleagues&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your excellent work in preventative medicine and public health, for example, in alcohol abuse, vaccination programmes, stopping smoking and preventing injury and where this work has been further developed beyond your immediate remit&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you use wider NHS resources effectively and improve their efficiencies&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Give evidence of the quality and breadth of your service from audits or assessments by patients, peers, your employer or external bodies. It will not affect your chances if there is less readily quantifiable evidence available in your particular specialty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quote the source of the information you give and include all relevant dates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“In an analysis of mixed arterial interventions (20xx), our vascular unit had relative risk of death 0.61 in the UK and the third largest arterial series in the country. We have benchmarked these data and the specific factors that have led to improvements so that others can benefit from our experience. My contribution to this outcome was…“&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Data from the intensive care national audit (ICNARC) (May 20xx), shows our unit is one of the top ten for survival with a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 0.65, meaning 60 patients lived who were expected to die. This performance has improved steadily since 20xx when our SMR was 1.35. In sharing this with ICNARC we established the predominant factors for survival and share best practice to improve outcomes more widely. My contribution to this outcome was…“&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I have set up a short stay programme which has the lowest length of stay for hip replacements in England – 2.7 days as against the England average of 6.1 days… 67% of patients are home after 2 nights… 98.5% patient satisfaction service… readmission rate of 5.1% as compared to the regional average of 7%. This has been communicated in xx forums and adopted as best practice standards by xx body.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give national or regional benchmark comparisons wherever you can. For example, Standard Mortality Ratios, peri-operative complication rates, MRSA, C. difficile rates, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, or length of stay data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Show how you have significantly improved the clinical effectiveness of your local services and either improved services elsewhere, or used your experience to enable others to do so. Similarly, this experience may be translatable to other clinical services in the wider NHS in other areas. This includes making services better, safer and more cost effective more widely, particularly in addressing differences in outcomes between different geographic regions, or diverse patient groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make your evidence as measurable as you can, giving dates for all activities. Make your personal contribution clear, not just your department’s contribution, stating what you have contributed as part of a wider team, where relevant. Give specific examples of any changes you made after the results of an audit, or changes you contributed to as part of governance reviews. Be clear about how you helped these activities contribute to wider change in the NHS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your evidence could, for example, cover the impact of your work on:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>developing and running audit cycles or plans for evidence-based practice to make the service measurably better&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national or local clinical audits and national confidential enquiries&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing and using diagnostic and other tools and techniques to find barriers to clinical effectiveness, ways to overcome them and to implement new ways of working&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysing and managing risk – include details of specific improvements, or how you lowered risk and improved safety&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>providing a better service, with proof of the effect it had – for example, how your service has become more patient centred and accessible&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving the service after speaking to patients, or setting up and engaging with patient support groups&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>redesigning a service to be more productive and efficient, with no decrease in the quality, at a regional or national level&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing new health or healthcare plans, or policies&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>large reviews, inquiries or investigations&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national policies to modernise health services, new ways of working or professional practice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Give audit or research evidence to show where you have improved your service and disseminated this more widely. Quote the sources and relevant dates and outcomes in your own areas and those of other groups that you positively influenced. You do not have to have done the audits or research yourself. Show what changes you made, alone or in a team, with evidence that they were of high quality and useful to the wider NHS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>See these examples:</p>

<p>“The development of a gastro intestinal bleed service has resulted in excellent outcomes. Mortality 2% vs. 7.1% nationally. Risk standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 0.58 National Audit. I presented these data at xxx conference leading to adoption of new guidelines from 20 xx. My contribution to this outcome was…“&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Based on superior outcomes I developed an international reputation for complex aortic surgery and thoracic abdominal aneurysms attracting referrals from other parts of the country. Our unit has the largest practice in the UK. We pioneered a hybrid open and endovascular operation for aneurysms involving the thoracic and abdominal aorta: first 75 cases elective mortality of 12.5%, elective and urgent of 16%. The world’s best reported results have mortality of 13%. Our thoracic aortic stent programme is the largest in UK with mortality of 3.8%. I have continued to develop my techniques and their assessment through ongoing audit. I have shared these widely leading to their national and international adoption and improvements in national data of xx%. My contribution to these outcomes was…“&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I have developed a continuous patient pathway with GP services for all preadmission clinics and day case surgery patients, ensuring venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment, appropriate thromboprophylaxis (including an extended duration component) with bleeding and VTE incidence, prevalence and follow-up data. This is already improving our understanding and awareness of the issue but also stimulating us to work with GP colleagues to streamline the process and expand its remit more widely. We estimate that, in the area piloted, xx bed days have been saved over the 6-month period of the pilot which has been further expanded into additional trusts with xx impact.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I used multi-disciplinary team working to effect systemic change throughout our unit, saving nearly 1,000 bed days. This reduced the requirement for elective beds by 25%…I developed two half session theatre days. This has greatly improved theatre efficiency…I helped set up and develop the Orthopaedic Outreach Team which greatly reduced length of stay and was highly commended in the 20xx HSJ Awards.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Domain 2: leadership</h3>

<p>In this section, show how you made a significant personal contribution to leading and developing a service, health policy or guidelines, with national or international impact. Especially consider work that has delivered against objectives within the NHS Long Term Plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Describe the impact you have had and outcomes you have generated in the specific roles you list. Your evidence can include, but is not limited to, proof of:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your effective leadership techniques and processes – give specific examples of how you improved the quality of care for your patients and where you have, directly or indirectly, influenced other parts of the NHS to achieve these benefits&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change management programmes or service innovations you have led – show how they made the service more effective, productive or efficient for patients, public and staff, beyond your direct remit&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>excellent leadership in developing and providing preventative medicine, particularly working across organisational or professional boundaries with other agencies, like local councils and the voluntary sector, demonstrating the outcomes or impacts that have been delivered, for example, in delivering benefits where health inequalities exist</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you helped staff or teams more widely improve patient care – give specific examples and their outcomes, such as mentoring or coaching. If you work in England, you could mention the guidance on talent and leadership planning&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any ambassador or change champion roles, for example if you were involved in a public consultation, or your job involved explaining complex issues and how this translated into changes in practice&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you developed a clear, shared vision and desire for change in others – for example, show how you invested in new ways of working and handled resistant behaviour to deliver the wider change desired outside of your remit, particularly where you did not have direct oversight responsibility&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you helped staff into senior leadership roles by removing barriers, encouraging diversity and achieving equality and inclusion outcomes&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you contributed to developing patient-focused services in your area, and cascaded the experience and expertise to influence others to adopt new ways of working&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>national impact through personal work and influence through any committee membership. Be specific in what you personally did, with a description of the impact of any output. Membership alone is not enough&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the effects of your team leadership where you had full or joint responsibility, or took turns with other leaders to lead specific areas of complementary work&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where you took personal leadership for clinical governance, including developing and implementing policies, services or change programmes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Include evidence of your contribution, the source of any data you give, and relevant dates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“As the lead obstetrician for Delivery Suite I have improved normal labour and birth through the initiation of a rigorous audit and examination of our processes and the impact of them on maternal and perinatal outcomes. The team’s work was recognised by winning the All Parliamentary Group for Maternity Services Award for 20xx resulting in updating of regional guidelines based on our local experience. This work has been shortlisted for the Royal College of Midwives’ annual award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I continue to lead the weekly obstetric risk management meeting. The reduction in reportable incidents when this meeting was established has continued and has now fallen from x% in 20xx to y% in 20xx. We continue to audit and improve our practice, reporting nationally.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I undertook a detailed review and redesign of the antenatal clinic service which has improved patient waiting times. We shared this with our trust leadership and instituted similar practices across the trust and now regionally. This has led to an increased clinic capacity of x over the last 2 years “&nbsp;</p>

<p>“In my role as chairperson of the regional neonatal network between 20xx and 20xx, I championed the rationalisation of beds and care levels across acute hospitals. As a result, transfers of neonates for clinical and nonclinical reasons have reduced by 10% resulting in reduced risk and improved outcomes of …x. See further data below.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not include your work or roles in education, such as chairperson of a training committee. You should include that information in domain 3.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Domain 3: education, training and people development</h3>

<p>In this section, give evidence to show your contribution to wider education and training across the professions and to patients. Please it make clear if any training or lecturing is externally or separately remunerated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give evidence of the impact of your work in supporting the NHS People Plan and if it falls into any of the following categories. We do not expect examples for all these categories and you can include other categories.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Teaching</h4>

<p>This can be medical undergraduate or multidisciplinary team teaching, if it is outside your job plan. Undergraduate teaching that is part of your job plan is not considered to be over and above your role. Give evidence of student feedback or other teacher quality assessments and especially focus on how your education has improved others’ performance and had a positive impact on healthcare. Include how you directly played a role in curriculum development and/or assessment and, if relevant, provide evidence of wider adoption of novel work in these areas in UK medical schools, or internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Leadership and innovation in training</h4>

<p>This should include evidence of the impact of these activities outside of your own remit, preferably nationally or internationally. This might include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>developing and introducing a new course, such as at masters level&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>innovative assessment methods&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introducing new learning facilities&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>writing successful textbooks or developing on-line teaching/training modules, or an app&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contributing to postgraduate education and life-long learning&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contributing to teaching and assessment in other UK centres or abroad&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing other innovative training methods, such as simulation-based&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Supporting information could be presentations, invitations to lecture, and publications on education – you must include evidence of the national impact of these activities.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Educating and informing patients and public</h4>

<p>This should also include evidence of the impact of these activities, preferably nationally or internationally. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>promoting good health and disease prevention within the community, which has delivered wider impacts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>facilitating the development of patient-support groups at a regional or national level that can show improved patient engagement and outcomes, tangible improvements in preventing illness and injury, or improved patient and public involvement in research.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>College or university success in teaching audits</h4>

<p>Explain if you helped a college or university succeed in regulatory body and quality assessment audits for teaching. This could include undergraduate or postgraduate exams, or supervising postgraduate students leading to a demonstrable impact on healthcare as a result</p>

<h4>Personal commitment to developing your teaching skills</h4>

<p>You could include evidence of Higher Education Academy membership and any courses you have completed, and how you have used these new skills or qualifications to improve NHS and other relevant work more widely.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unexpected or non-mainstream contributions</h4>

<p>This could be any other teaching or educational commitment that has had national impact and is outside your job plan or other paid work, that is not recognised in other ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<p>“My course for xxxx (20xx to 20xx), innovative in its integrated health systems and active learning approaches, has sought and used intensive feedback to enable modification of the course before wider roll out. It is approved for continuing professional development by xxxx, and shows significant gains in knowledge and skills, and excellent participant feedback. This has translated into an x% increase in qualified staff available for xxx work and a resultant increase in quality of care and outcomes from y to z over the 5 year period covering 20xx to 20xx”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Domain 4: innovation and research</h3>

<p>This section looks at innovation and its impact in any relevant setting and should include more evidence than the activities that are traditionally considered as research. It can include new care pathways that have been developed and implemented, improved ways of working and process efficiencies that have been adopted widely and have demonstrably made more cost-effective use of NHS resources. It can include benefits of digital technology, or other activities from projects with external partners that have demonstrated a benefit to the wider NHS or support <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>’s objectives of promoting research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be clear what evidence is over-and-above any research, academic or other expectations of your role and give evidence of the wider impact of your research and/or innovation. This includes developing the evidence base for measuring how quality has improved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the section on references, give details of achievements such as published peer reviewed papers – not the names of referees, with a maximum of 10 references to be included. The majority of any publications listed should be from the last 5 years. Your evidence should include the relevance of these publications and the wider impact they have had. Providing the number of citations each paper has had or its academic ‘score’ is not sufficient without further explanation of its impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a separate line, explain what you have achieved to date and how your innovation or research has quantifiably improved health outcomes, and give supporting evidence. For example, give details of new evidence-based techniques, innovative systems or service models you have developed that others have adopted. Explain how you found better ways to deliver direct clinical benefits, made more effective use of resources and disseminated your experience so it has been adopted by others. Provide specific details of the quantified benefits this has provided over the relevant dated time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could also explain how you have improved patient and public engagement in research and innovation or encouraged new ways of thinking when it comes to improving patient services, detailing the specific benefits this has brought.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should describe the effect of your research (including laboratory research) and any new techniques you have developed and the wider benefits they have delivered on:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>health service practice&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>health service policy&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing health services</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For this you should also be clear on how your research is relevant to the health of patients and the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could give details of the impacts you have delivered as a result of:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>large trials or evaluations, including systematic reviews, you have led or coinvestigated and published in the last 5 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how you have contributed as a research leader, and how you have helped and supervised other people’s research and mentored new investigators</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You could include other examples of the personal impact you have made in your chosen research fields. For example, how your work on any review boards of national funding agencies or learned societies has delivered quantifiable improvements over a defined time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>list any grants you have been awarded personally and not as part of a department, specifying your role as chief or principal investigator where relevant – and explain how this funding is used to deliver benefits&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>describe peer-reviewed publications, chapters, or books you have written or edited – list your editorial activity for each one (for example, senior editor) and any quantitative measures on how effective they have been in changing practice&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give details if you played a major part in research studies in more than one centre, for example personally recruiting participants to large clinical trials&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include evidence of outstanding research that has led to new ways of preventing illness and injury, or more rapid, cost-effective, and reliable diagnosis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>show how you engaged with a funding council, NIHR or a major research charity, specifying your role, e.g. as a clinical director, senior reviewer or research/fellowship programme lead. Give clear dates and evidence of impact&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<p>“As Director of Research and Development (R&amp;D) in the last 3 years, I have positioned the trust as one of the leading 5 NHS research centres in the country, and developed a research service to support clinicians with robust governance processes, a clinical trials office, a research design service, and funding for research time. This has led to an increase in research output of x, which has provided input to xxx national guidelines and policies”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“My research is in stroke, which is a public health priority for prevention and improvement of care. The development of a public health model for chronic disease using stroke has proved relevant to assessing needs and evaluating innovative models of care improving prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of stroke from y to z. In acute stroke, we have reduced time to assessment and intervention from x hours to y hours over the last 3 years resulting in improved outcomes and functionally independent discharge rates from y% to x%&nbsp; My R&amp;D leadership role has enabled academic and clinical organisations to develop joint National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) centres in biomedical and health services research and training for population and patient benefit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I have developed booking systems for use in emergency and trauma theatre settings. These secure systems allow cases to be booked into emergency theatres from anywhere in the hospital, informing all emergency staff of pending cases and their preparedness. The system links with hospital investigation reporting systems allowing blood investigations for each patient to be accessed. In addition, the trauma booking system can be linked to a radiological teaching package. When a fracture type is booked onto the system, the booking doctor is offered the opportunity to look at the system of classification for that fracture type and to review teaching radiographs of each type. The system won a 20xx national Theatre Innovation Award for IT and has improved our outcomes from x to y over the last 5 years. I have piloted the wider use of these systems outside of our trust and these have been adopted in 5 other trusts with a net benefit of x”</p>

<h3>Domain 5: additional national impact</h3>

<p>This domain is an opportunity to provide evidence of wider beneficial impacts that have not been captured elsewhere in your evidence, or to demonstrate how your work has had a wider effect on areas that are national clinical priorities. This could relate to work within your job plan, but should demonstrate the national impact over and above the expectations of activity you are paid to do. You can include any work for charitable organisations, and work which may have more of a patient or public focus, tackling health and workplace inequalities and fostering interprofessional team building and new ways of working. It can also include international work in training, research or recruitment, that is of clear benefit to the NHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other relevant activities are NHS priority disease areas such as cancer, its diagnosis, prevention, treatment and outcomes, communicable and non-communicable diseases, or other areas where there is outstanding need, or identified health inequalities or disparities. It may also cover public health and patient care pathways. For example, demonstrating how you have prevented inappropriate emergency department attendance or generated other benefits, perhaps working with social care providers or third parties in other ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could include your work on delivering wider health policies, or your impact related to the NHS Long Term Plan or the NHS People Plan, particularly in reference to collaborative working, demonstrating an inclusive culture and the health and wellbeing of NHS staff and their retention in the face of increasing pressures. Give details of how you delivered wider change and the magnitude of your impacts over a defined time period. Tell us if you are actively involved in a leadership capacity at a regional or national level in the delivery of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/delivery-plan-for-tackling-the-covid-19-backlog-of-elective-care/" rel="external">2022 COVID backlog plan</a>, defining clearly the impact of your personal contribution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider providing evidence of the impact you have made on delivering improved ‘joined up care’ in line with the recommendations of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-integration-joining-up-care-for-people-places-and-populations/health-and-social-care-integration-joining-up-care-for-people-places-and-populations">Integration White paper</a> in optimal settings by implementing new service models, or specifically digital innovations or efficiencies, across the wider health environments – particularly if you have expanded these beyond your immediate area or remit. Also consider activities and innovations that have been developed in partnership with external partners which provided positive impacts to the NHS and are in line with the government’s Life Sciences Strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Include impacts on outcomes improvement, particularly in areas identified with unmet need, or where there is undue variation in outcomes across the NHS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This domain could also be used to provide additional evidence that is related to evidence from one of the other domains, but avoid repeating evidence, as it will only be scored once. Instead, take the opportunity to demonstrate a different aspect of your work that is over and above your job role and how this has had incremental impact as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Part 6: How to appeal</h2>

<h3>Appeals for national awards</h3>

<p>All appeals for <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Awards">NCIAs</abbr> are handled by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To appeal, log into your account where you will find the steps you need to take.</p>

<p>You need to tell us why you believe the assessment process was unfair and give evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Submit your appeal for a national award within 4 weeks of when we inform you of the award results. If our dates change, this will be updated in the portal.</p>

<h3>Reasons you can request an appeal</h3>

<p>You can request an appeal if you think we did not follow the right processes when we assessed your application. You cannot appeal because you disagree with our judgement.</p>

<p>You can appeal if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the committee did not consider all the supporting information or documents you sent with your application&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>irrelevant information was taken into account&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you were discriminated against due to characteristics such as your gender, ethnicity or age&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the usual evaluation processes were not followed&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the committee, or any of its members, showed bias or had a conflict of interest, such as where someone involved in a decision could be affected by the result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How we handle appeals</h3>

<p>Our chair and medical director will look at your evidence and the processes that were followed to decide if your appeal is justified. They will then ask a panel of two sub-committee members – one medical and one non-medical – who were not involved in your application to review their proposed decision to ensure it is robust. If it is decided that there are no grounds for appeal, we will write to tell you why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are grounds for appeal and we cannot resolve the problem informally, we will set up a formal appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A separate panel of people who did not assess your application or the decision to progress the appeal will consider this. The panel will include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a medical or dental professional&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an employer&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a non-professional member as chairperson</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They will look at:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your appeal&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the documents that set out our agreed assessment process&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a written statement of what the committee did when they considered your application&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can see all the documents the panel considers. You can also send more written statements about your appeal and what you believe happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The panel does not usually hear oral evidence. However, you can apply in writing to have an oral hearing. The panel chair will decide whether you can have one.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The timeline for appeals</h3>

<p>We try to resolve appeals in line with the process set out below – if there are delays, we will let you know.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>If your appeal is successful</h3>

<p>If your appeal is successful, our chair and medical director will consider the best way to put things right. Their decision will be consistent with other similar appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if your appeal against the process is successful, you may not get your renewal or a new award. If this happens, we will write to you to tell you why.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The national appeals process</h3>

<p>Here is an outline of the process with indicative timelines:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When we get your request to appeal, we will contact you within 5 working days to acknowledge its receipt.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our chair and medical director will review your case and decide whether you have grounds for a formal appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within approximately 20 working days of the date we got in touch, our chair and medical director will let you know if there will be a formal appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there is a formal appeal, we will set up a panel and agree a date for them to meet, usually within 20 working days.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When our chair and medical director hear what the panel has decided, they will let you know the final decision, usually within 20 working days.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all cases, the panel’s decision is final.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Part 7: How to complain</h2>

<p>We can only handle complaints about the work, staff and levels of service provided by <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>. You can email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:accia@dhsc.gov.uk">accia@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will not accept complaints relating to awards decisions. For how to appeal, please see Part 6.</p>

<p>If you want to make a formal complaint about <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>, we will need:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a clear, detailed description of what your complaint is about&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>copies of any letters or emails related to the complaint&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your email address -so we can respond to you</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you have made your complaint, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send an email to let you know that we have received it</li>
</ul>

<p>Our complaints process has 3 stages:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stage 1 – complaints go to the team leader of the <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr> Secretariat, who will liaise with the relevant sub-committee chair, if necessary. The team leader will investigate, with a target of responding to your complaint within 20 working days.</p>

<p>Stage 2 – complaints are investigated by the Senior Civil Servant responsible for <abbr title="Advisory Committee on Clinical Impact Awards">ACCIA</abbr>. They will investigate with a target of responding to your complaint within 20 working days.</p>

<p>Stage 3 – complaints are investigated by a Senior Civil Servant who is independent of the individual or team that your complaint references. They will investigate with a target of responding to your complaint within 20 working days.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What to do if you are not satisfied</h3>

<p>At each stage of our complaints process, you will be provided with the information to escalate your complaint if you are unhappy with the response that you receive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If, after following the 3 stages of our complaints process, you are not satisfied with the outcome of your formal complaint, you can ask your local MP to refer it to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/" rel="external">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have to go through your MP – you cannot approach the ombudsman directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ombudsman investigates complaints where government departments or other public bodies have not acted properly or fairly, or have provided a poor service. Government departments have to co-operate with the ombudsman by law.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Appealing against a decision by the ombudsman</h3>

<p>If you are unhappy with the ombudsman’s decision, you can appeal directly to the ombudsman.</p>

<h2>Part 8: If your circumstances change when you have an award</h2>

<p>You must tell us if your circumstances change after you have gained an award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must tell us if there are any changes to your employment, as they may affect your award. Please fill in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clinical-excellence-award-holders-employment-change-notification">change in employment circumstances form</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not tell us when your circumstances change, it could affect whether you can keep your award, or what you and your employer are paid. Any payments made since the change in circumstances may need to be paid back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below are some of the main changes you need to tell us about. This is not a full list, and you should tell us if anything significant changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tell us if your specialty, job, or job plan changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let us know if:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you stop practising in the field in which you obtained your award&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you change your job or employer&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is a significant change to your job plan – including a reduction in the number of programmed activities or sessions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tell us as soon as the change has been agreed locally. We will consider how it affects your award. We will also review your award earlier if you change your job, or your job plan changes significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you agree a new job plan, please send us a copy to consider and approve. If you do not tell us your job plan has changed, it could put your award at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you start working less than full time, we will review your eligibility to retain your award. National CEAs will be paid pro rata whereas national CIAs are paid at the full rate should the minimum number of 3PAs be contractually agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you stop practising in the field you got your award and start a full or part-time general management post, it could affect your award. Speak to your employer and contact us to see if you can keep getting the full financial value. If you no longer meet the criteria in part 2 of this guide, your payments normally stop.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Leave or secondments</h3>

<h4>Unpaid Leave</h4>

<p>We do not pay any awards during unpaid leave. If you take unpaid leave for more than a year, our medical director will decide whether your award can be reinstated.</p>

<h4>Maternity leave, parental leave and adoption leave&nbsp;</h4>

<p>If you have an award and go on maternity, parental or adoption leave, you will receive your award payments during any period of paid leave from your employer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Secondments&nbsp;</h4>

<p>If you are on full-time secondment to a post with an employer that does not qualify under the <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr> scheme, we will suspend your award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speak to your employer before you start your secondment to make arrangements for protecting your award and whether you can start collecting it again after your secondment has finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are seconded part time and continue some work from your original contract part time, you may be eligible for a pro rata award national CEA payment if you hold a CEA. If you hold an <abbr title="national Clinical Impact Award">NCIA</abbr>, you may be eligible to continue your award payments. In both cases, tell us your plans before you start your secondment, so we can agree the arrangements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are on secondment for less than a year, you will resume receipt of your award once the secondment has ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the secondment is longer than a year, we will consider whether to re-instate your award if you go back to the NHS and your role remains eligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are away between 1 and 5 years, you can apply to have your award reinstated. Generally, if you are away for 5 years or more, you must reapply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are seconded to the Independent Sector Treatment programme, or similar, while you still have your NHS consultant contract, you may be able to retain your award based on our assessment of your role. Should you remain eligible you will be able to apply for a new award during this time if your award is expiring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sabbaticals&nbsp;</h4>

<p>If you are planning a sabbatical, you must speak to your employer and contact us to agree what happens with your award. To retain the award, you must prove your sabbatical will be of benefit to the NHS. Otherwise, we will consider suspending your award until you return, or it expires.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Prolonged absence from the NHS&nbsp;</h4>

<p>If, for any reason, you have been on a prolonged absence and not practised your specialty in the NHS for more than a year, we will review whether your award can be re-instated.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Leaving the NHS during an award round&nbsp;</h4>

<p>To qualify for an award, you must be employed as a consultant in the NHS on 1 April in the award year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are made redundant or you retire during an award round and before we announce the award results, we will withdraw your application.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tell us if you retire or claim your pension&nbsp;</h4>

<p>If you are in receipt of any pension payments, you no longer qualify for your national award. This includes payments from the NHS Pension Scheme, University Superannuation Scheme or transferred-out benefits. However, you can apply to re-enter the scheme, or any schemes that replace it (see Part 2 for details).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must tell us the date you retire or claim your pension (see Part 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tell us if you start being investigated.</p>

<p>As set out at Part 2 and Part 3, you must tell us, as soon as you know, of any investigations, disciplinary procedures or legal action against you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You must keep us up to date about any developments and the outcomes of any investigations. We will decide if they affect your application or award. We always use an ‘innocent unless proven otherwise’ approach.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Part 9: False statements or possible fraud</h2>

<p>If we find any evidence of a false statement or fraud, we will take suitable action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This may include passing the details to:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your employer(s)&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> or <abbr title="General Dental Council">GDC</abbr>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the NHS Counter Fraud Authority</p>
  </li>
</ul>
