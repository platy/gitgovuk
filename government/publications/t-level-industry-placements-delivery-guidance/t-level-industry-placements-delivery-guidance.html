<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance will help providers and employers to deliver high-quality industry placements, which form a mandatory component of the T Level programme.</p>

<h3>Review date</h3>

<p>This guidance will be reviewed before July 2023.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>

<p>This guidance is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the principals, senior leadership teams, governing bodies, trustees, and staff of all institutions delivering T Levels</li>
  <li>all institutions delivering T Level-style placements through the industry placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF), and those considering offering T Levels</li>
  <li>industry and employers interested in or involved in delivering T Level or T Level-style industry placements, and their representative bodies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Purpose of this guidance</h3>

<p>The Department for Education has a responsibility to make sure that both T Level providers and employers that offer industry placements, are aware of and adhere to their responsibilities to ensure that placements are delivered consistently and to a high standard, irrespective of where and when they take place. This guidance outlines the key roles and responsibilities for providers and employers in delivering high-quality placements at each stage of the placement i.e. pre, during, and post-placement. It also sets out information about what must happen when students have been unable to complete the minimum placement hours before the end of the second year of the T Level programme.</p>

<p>The guidance includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on how to set learning goals to ensure that students are given occupationally relevant and stretching activities and tasks on their placement (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a>)</li>
  <li>advice on how to prepare students for their placements (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a>)</li>
  <li>criteria to help providers and employers identify whether students are sufficiently making progress towards their learning goals (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">section 4</a>)</li>
  <li>information about industry placement completion exceptions and criteria for when special consideration can be applied in exceptional circumstances to ensure that students are not unfairly disadvantaged if they are unable to complete the industry placement due to factors beyond their control (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a>)</li>
  <li>advice for when providers can apply their discretion to allow students an additional 2 years to complete their industry placement, when the students have been unable to complete their placement within the 2-year T Level programme (<a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a>)</li>
  <li>additional allowable route-specific models and approaches of industry placement delivery (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 1: Overview of industry placements</h2>

<h3>T Levels</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-of-t-levels/introduction-of-t-levels">T Levels</a> are high-quality, Level 3 classroom-based technical programmes that will equip students with the skills, knowledge and behaviours they need to progress into skilled employment.</p>

<p>T Level programmes have been approved by the Institute of Apprenticeships and Technical Education (Institute) under sections A2DA and A2DB of the Apprenticeships Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. T Level programmes will consist of 4 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an Institute-approved Technical Qualification (TQ)</li>
  <li>an industry placement</li>
  <li>a minimum standard of maths and English if students have not already achieved these</li>
  <li>any other occupation-specific mandatory additional requirements, as identified by the Institute, that are needed for entry to employment or to commence an industry placement.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above components must be completed or achieved for a T Level certificate to be awarded<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Expectations on providers and employers</h3>

<p>For the purposes of funding, the department expects providers’ full compliance with the industry placement core principles and guidance set out in this document. Providers must also satisfy themselves that the employers providing the placements are complying with their roles and responsibilities set out in this guidance.</p>

<h3>Funding and resourcing industry placement provision</h3>

<p>Providers should review their internal resource requirements and consider if further staff training is required to ensure that the right level of expertise is in place to adhere to this guidance. Providers will receive T Level funding, which includes industry placement funding, to support these costs. Providers should familiarise themselves with the online guidance on [How T Levels will be funded]https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-t-levels-are-funded). The T Level Professional Development offer, provided by The Education and Training Foundation, is available to help staff prepare for successful delivery of the first T Levels.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to check that providers understand their roles and responsibilities and are implementing their industry placement provision effectively.</p>

<p>Recognising that each institution will have different staff structures and professional titles, this guidance does not identify roles for particular tasks. Instead it refers to ‘providers’ in most cases and it is for the individual institution to identify appropriate staff members.</p>

<p>All templates and forms included as annexes with this guidance can be adapted locally and kept electronically. However, providers must ensure they include all the components and content outlined in the templates and forms.</p>

<h3>Providers delivering T Level-style placements through the CDF</h3>

<p>The department expects providers delivering T Level-style industry placements, funded by the CDF, to comply with this guidance (so far as it is relevant to them) for placements delivered in the 2020/21 academic year onwards.</p>

<p>All elements of the guidance are relevant to providers delivering T Level-style industry placements funded by the CDF, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special consideration and the allowance for industry placements to continue beyond the 2-year T Level Programme (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">Section 5</a>). This is because the industry placement is a compulsory part of the T Level for T Level students, therefore, concessions have been made for extenuating circumstances to allow students to achieve the T Level</li>
  <li>requirements relating to the Manage T Level results service as this only relates to T Level students</li>
</ul>

<h3>Industry placement core principles</h3>

<p>The core principles outlined in this guidance apply to all industry placements. It is important that industry placements are high-quality, delivered consistently and offer students a meaningful experience.</p>

<p>The department recognises that ‘one size doesn’t fit all.’ As such, some of the core principles can be adapted to ensure placements are high quality, meaningful and deliverable across different industries, as well as being accessible for all students. For more details, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industry-placements-policy-framework">industry placements policy update</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a> outlines the allowable general and route-specific models and approaches, which can be adopted as necessary to ensure placements are accessible and meaningful for all students and are deliverable across all T Level provision. Providers should complete the industry placement notification form at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex B</a> where these models and approaches have been adopted because the department needs to monitor how they are being used.</p>

<p>The industry placement for the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, within the Education and Childcare T Level, has several additional requirements and differences in delivery that are unique to the occupational specialism. These are detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex C</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Industry placement core principles</h3>

<p><strong>Takes place in a working environment</strong>: must be external to students’ normal learning environment so they experience what it is like to be in a real-life job, including travel to work, independence from their peers and working with new people, except for students with SEND or in Young Offender Institutions where alternative approaches can be applied and work taster activities that can be delivered remotely. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a> for information about these alternative approaches. Placements cannot be delivered virtually/remotely, except for work taster activities</p>

<p><strong>Relevant to the occupational specialism</strong>: must be focussed on developing up-to-date technical skills and specialist knowledge required for the students’ occupational specialism, which is underpinned by the qualification content that students are studying at Level 3. However, students studying Digital and Engineering &amp; Manufacturing T Levels can undertake a route level placement that allows them to develop the knowledge and skills studied at route level rather than those only relevant to their occupational specialism. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a> for more information about route level placements.</p>

<p><strong>Number of employers</strong>: a placement can be split across 2 employers, where this is considered necessary for ‘breadth of content’ and/or beneficial for students.</p>

<p><strong>Duration</strong>: must be for a minimum of 315 hours (there is no upper limit), which can include up to 35 hours of work taster activities, if relevant to all the occupational specialisms within the T Level. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a> for eligible work taster activities. The only exception currently is the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, within the Education and Childcare T Level, that must be for a minimum of 750 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Timing</strong>: must be organised in line with the normal requirements of the industry, which may be outside the academic timetable or normal provider working hours. Placement hours must align with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/faqs/workingtimedirective.htm" rel="external">Working Time Regulations</a>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Industry placement completion</strong> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">section 4</a> for more information): to complete their placement students must: demonstrate sufficient progress towards their learning goals, work directly to an external employer, and have been on placement for the minimum number of hours.</p>

<p><strong>Industry placement completion exceptions</strong>: special consideration can be applied in some exceptional circumstances where students have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals but have not completed the minimum number of hours within the 2-year programme (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a> for more information). Where students have not been able to meet the minimum number of hours and have not demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals, providers can apply their discretion and allow the student to continue their placement following their 2-year programme to allow them to make up their hours and receive full T Level certification (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a> for more information).</p>

<p><strong>Student readiness</strong>: providers must ensure students are suitably prepared to enter the workplace before they go on their industry placement. This includes having the required technical and employability skills and knowledge, including a good understanding of the professional standards of behaviour and attitude they need to display on their placement and the importance of adhering to company policies and procedures. See section 2 for more information.</p>

<p><strong>SEND accessibility</strong>: providers and employers must comply with their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reasonable-adjustments-a-legal-duty/reasonable-adjustments-a-legal-duty">legal duties under the Equality Act 2010</a>, including provisions for reasonable adjustments, so that students with Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) can benefit from high-quality external industry placements as much as their non-SEND peers. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Placement structure</strong>: there is not one fixed model for delivery and placements can take place over a block, day release or a mix of both. A series of allowable general and route specific models can also be adopted to ensure placements are accessible for all students and deliverable across all industries. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Student safeguarding</strong>: providers must be satisfied workplaces are a safe working environment for students, that employers are complying with their responsibilities, and students’ wellbeing is checked via regular review meetings. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a> for more information.</p>
</div>

<h2>Section 2: Pre-placement</h2>

<h3>Communication to students and their parents/carers</h3>

<p>Industry placements are what distinguish T Levels from other programmes at Level 3, as they enable students to put the skills they have learned in the classroom into practice in the workplace.</p>

<p>Providers must make it very clear to students and their parents/carers, prior to students enrolling onto the T Level programme, that it is a full-time course and the industry placement is a mandatory part of the programme.</p>

<p>Providers must also make very clear the duration of the industry placement and the expectations it entails. This is vital to secure the commitment of the students and their parents/carers to both the T Level programme and the industry placement.</p>

<h3>Curriculum planning and timing of placements</h3>

<p>Providers must plan the curriculum for each T Level to fully deliver the TQ content and assessment requirements. There is not one fixed model for delivery. Instead, planning should consider the available teaching resources and the most suitable industry placement working pattern, such as day release, block placement or a mixture of both. Industry placement provision should also reflect industry practice and support employers to offer placements, while accommodating students with differing circumstances, such as SEND and caring responsibilities.</p>

<p>The key to successful curriculum design and planning for placement hours is to ensure that the sequencing supports the students’ learning through their T Level journey by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating opportunities for work taster activities that can help students decide on their occupational specialism. Up to 35 hours of work taster activities can be counted towards the 315 minimum hour requirement if they are relevant to all the occupational specialisms within the students’ T Level. These activities can be delivered remotely. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a> for eligible work taster activities</li>
  <li>providing sufficient time for work-preparation activities</li>
  <li>incorporating time to cover the minimum starting requirements and suggested prior learning in advance of the placement starting. Providers should refer to the table in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex D</a> that lists supplementary recommendations for some T Level industry placements, which are considered beneficial to some students on a particular career path</li>
  <li>planning the timing of the placement at the right stage(s) to strengthen the students’ core and specialist knowledge and development of the relevant technical skills, and allow them to make a positive contribution in the workplace</li>
  <li>planning the timing of the industry placement early enough in the 2-year T Level programme to allow sufficient time for students to make up any shortfall in hours before the end of the programme, if their placement has been disrupted. For the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, placements must begin in the first year due to the increased placement hours</li>
  <li>ensuring that the placement is scheduled around and/or allows for sufficient time for assessments, which may occur in fixed windows or need to be taken on a specific date and time</li>
  <li>working collaboratively with employers to establish the most appropriate placement working pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that students are at an appropriate stage in their T Level studies before commencing their placement. During their placement students will be expected to draw on both their core and specialist knowledge, skills and behaviours they have learnt in the classroom and apply them in the workplace setting, through relevant occupationally specific tasks and activities.</p>

<p>Providers must ensure the placement hours can comfortably be built into the curriculum. It is good practice for providers to plan in more placement hours than the required minimum to allow for contingency planning for student sickness/absence. Also, it is advisable that providers have a sufficient supply of employers to draw upon in the case of placements not working out. Providers can refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359139-How-to-engage-employers-with-industry-placements" rel="external">employer engagement toolkit</a> for helpful advice and tips.</p>

<h3>Preparing students for the workplace</h3>

<p>As well as making sure that students are equipped with the technical knowledge and skills, providers must ensure that students are suitably prepared to enter the workplace. This should involve the development of employability skills and a good understanding of the professional standards of behaviour and attitudes before they go on their industry placement. This is vital to make sure that students get the most out of their placements, and for building and maintaining relationships with employers and encourage future engagement.</p>

<p>It is important that students understand the unique learning opportunity the industry placement offers. In particular they need to understand that it is a valuable addition to their CV and will make a significant difference to their future employment prospects, as it will help to make them stand out against other applicants in the job market.</p>

<p>In ensuring students are prepared for the workplace, providers must make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>placements are directly related to each student’s course</li>
  <li>students have been taught the technical skills and knowledge, and the employability skills, needed for their placement</li>
  <li>students understand the professional standards of behaviours and attitudes they need to display on their placement</li>
  <li>students understand the importance of adhering to the organisation’s policies and procedures whilst on their placement, including around the use of their personal mobile phone and social media</li>
  <li>students have thoroughly researched the organisation their placement will be with</li>
  <li>students understand the importance of networking and how to use professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn</li>
  <li>students understand what to do and who to speak to if they are anxious or if a problem arises whilst on their placement</li>
  <li>students know the practical arrangements for their placement, such as the days they need to attend, the start and finish times, whether they are being paid a wage, whether their expenses are being covered and their travel arrangements to the placement</li>
  <li>students consider writing to, or emailing, their manager at the employer - after the placements finish - to thank them and set out what they have gained from the placement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Student guide</h3>

<p>The department has developed the [Student guide - preparing for your industry placement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-guide-preparing-for-industry-placements, which is designed to complement providers’ existing student preparation material. It is a reference document for students that provides them with advice and signposts them to online resources that can help them to prepare for the workplace, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to write a CV and prepare for an interview</li>
  <li>how to identify and develop important employability skills for the workplace</li>
  <li>what professional behaviours and attitudes they need to demonstrate on their placement</li>
  <li>the importance of networking and LinkedIn</li>
  <li>how to troubleshoot any issues that might occur on their placement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Student work-readiness assessments</h3>

<p>Before delivering student preparation training, providers must carry out student work-readiness assessments. This could include getting students to complete a self-assessment or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359539-Self-assessment-tool-to-check-student-readiness-for-industry-placements" rel="external">student work-readiness tool</a>. Student work-readiness assessments allows providers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand knowledge gaps, concerns and areas of support required at both an individual and group level, including what employability skills students already have and which they need to develop</li>
  <li>enables students to reflect on their strengths and areas for development</li>
  <li>design relevant student preparation that will support students and meet their needs</li>
</ul>

<p>It is good practice for another assessment to be carried out after the preparation training but still in good time before placements are due to begin. This is so providers can identify any remaining areas of concern and/or build students’ confidence as they reflect on their growth in knowledge and skills.</p>

<h3>Teacher and employer involvement</h3>

<p>It is recommended that teachers are involved in the student preparation training so that it incorporates their knowledge of the TQ requirements and curriculum content.</p>

<p>Where possible, providers should also seek feedback from employers on the preparedness of the students as part of the industry placement review meetings. This feedback can be used to feed into and contribute to future curriculum planning. For example, where a significant number of employers identify that students are not prepared with a specific skill, the curriculum can be modified to take account of the feedback.</p>

<p>Evidence of completed student work-readiness assessments and student preparation training must be collated. This can be used in conjunction with the industry placement learning goals and progress indicators for evidencing students’ progress at their review meetings.</p>

<h3>Employability skills preparation</h3>

<p>As part of student preparation training, in addition to ensuring students have the appropriate technical skills and knowledge, providers need to develop students’ employability skills. For some students, the industry placement will be their first experience of a real working environment so they may also need to be taught the basics, such as good timekeeping, teamwork and organisation skills.</p>

<p>Some providers will already have an employability skills programme in place. This may be designed and delivered internally or with awarding bodies, such as City &amp; Guilds, NOCN and Edexcel. Some providers will choose to use learn-to-work programmes, which can help students develop their own self-reflection skills and identify areas for improvement.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://barclayslifeskills.com/young-people/" rel="external">Barclays’ Life Skills</a> and Accenture’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://s2sacademy.com/" rel="external">Skills to Succeed Academy</a> provide some useful resources which providers may like to use to help with employability skills preparation. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsbuilder.org/universal-framework/listening" rel="external">skills builder framework</a>, which has been developed with over 700 organisations, provides a tool that providers can use with their students to assess and develop key employability skills that are needed for the workplace.</p>

<p>More detailed advice on what providers should include in their skills preparation training, including an example ‘best practice’ curriculum and best practice for employability workshops, are outlined in the Association of College’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015344780-Preparing-students-for-industry-placements" rel="external">How to prepare students guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Student led industry placement search</h3>

<p>Providers need to support students who are finding their own placements. They should support them to research employers, set up email alerts, collate employer contacts, write a speculative letter to employers, and speak confidently to prospective employers on the phone. Providers and students should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015340359-Helping-students-to-source-their-own-industry-placements" rel="external">self-sourcing guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Employer research</h3>

<p>Students should be equipped with skills to research the employer they have been matched to or that they have an interview with, so they feel well-prepared. They should have a good understanding of the products or services the organisation provides, its vision, values and culture, the organisational structure, whether it has a local, national, or international focus. They should also read up on the organisation’s recent news.</p>

<h3>CV writing and interview skills</h3>

<p>Students should be supported to write a CV and cover letter and be given interview preparation and interview skills guidance. Tools available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.startprofile.com/" rel="external">Start</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.kudos.com/" rel="external">Kudos</a> may be a good starting point to help students write a CV and the Association of College provides <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.aoc.co.uk/sites/default/files/Example%20interview%20questions.docx" rel="external">example interview questions</a>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/get-a-job/cv-sections#CV-explained" rel="external">National Careers Service</a>, Barclay’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://barclayslifeskills.com/young-people/" rel="external">LifeSkills</a> and Accenture’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://s2sacademy.com/" rel="external">Skills to Succeed Academy</a> also offer free online tools to help students build their CV and prepare for interviews.</p>

<h3>Organisation policies and procedures</h3>

<p>It is important that students understand the importance of adhering to the employer’s policies and procedures at all times whilst on their placement, and the likely consequences if they do not adhere to them. These should be explained as part of the employer’s induction programme.</p>

<p>Providers should make students aware that some industries and organisations will have dress codes that will require them to dress in a certain way on their placement. Students also need to understand the importance of adhering to the employer’s health and safety policies, particularly in high risk working environments, to protect them and others from getting hurt.</p>

<p>Students also need to be aware that organisations will have a drug and alcohol policy and if they are found to be using drugs and alcohol on their placement, the employer will most likely remove them from the premises and stop the placement.</p>

<h3>Behaviours and attitudes in the workplace</h3>

<p>Students must have a good understanding of the professional standards of behaviours and attitudes they must display on their placement, and the importance that employers place on this.</p>

<p>Students should be encouraged to ask questions if they need clarification about the work they are doing on their placement. They also need to have the confidence to ask for help if they are worried about anything or if they have any safety concerns.</p>

<p>The following table sets out the professional behaviours and attitudes that students need to demonstrate in the workplace. It is also included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-guide-preparing-for-industry-placements">Student guide - preparing for your industry placement</a> for students to refer to throughout their placement. It is based on the expected behaviours in the progress indicators guide at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex F</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>End of placement</h3>

<p>Providers should make students aware that employers may ask them to do a short presentation at the end of their placement about what they have learnt. This should be agreed in advance with the employer so the student can be supported to prepare for it. Students should also be prepared to handover their work to the employer.</p>

<p>Providers should make sure that students know what to do at the end of the placement and have not forgotten anything that could help them to get more out of it.</p>

<p>This includes making sure that students:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a note of any work email addresses and/or work phone numbers for people they want to keep in touch with</li>
  <li>ask their manager if they would be willing to give them an employer reference in the future</li>
  <li>do not leave any personal documents or files on the employer’s IT equipment, such as their  industry placement logbook and timesheets</li>
  <li>do not take any other files or documents from the placement without written permission from the organisation</li>
  <li>thank anyone they feel made their placement a positive experience, including writing to or emailing their main contact at the employer to thank them for their help and set out what they have gained from the placement. This will also help ensure the providers and employers maintain a good relationship</li>
</ul>

<h3>Employability and pastoral (EEP) support and work taster activities</h3>

<p>Providers may take advantage of the enrichment, employability, and pastoral (EEP) support and work taster activities in the first and/or second year of the T Level programme to help with student preparation. Providers are funded to include up to 70 hours for EEP support per year within the T Level programme, which offer enrichment to students, such as personal and social development.</p>

<p>Providers should ensure EEP support and work taster activities take place early enough in the programme to help inform students’ choice of occupational specialism and/or provide a useful opportunity to develop relevant work-readiness skills, as preparation for their placement. They may also provide the first opportunity for students to spend time in working environment, thereby being a good indicator of how they manage outside their comfort zone, helping providers to determine what additional support might be required.</p>

<p>Up to 35 hours of work taster activities can be counted towards the minimum placement hours requirement, as long as these activities are relevant to all the occupational specialisms within the students’ T Level. Work taster activities should take place in conjunction with employers and focus on developing skills or facilitating experiences that better prepare students to enter their placement and/or to make a more informed decision when choosing their occupational specialism. Work taster activities could include job-shadowing or visits to different employers. These activities can be delivered remotely. For more details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex A</a>.</p>

<h4>Further guidance and resources</h4>

<p>More detailed advice on what providers should include in their skills preparation training, including an example ‘best practice’ curriculum and best practice for employability workshops, are outlined in the Association of College’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015344780-Preparing-students-for-industry-placements" rel="external">How to prepare students guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Preparing students with SEND</h3>

<p>Providers may already have considerable experience supporting students with SEND into work. Providers must ensure that their individual needs are identified, and the right level of support is provided so that SEND students have fair access to industry placements. This includes all students with SEND, and not just those with an education, health, and care plan (EHC plan). Providers may consider factors such as: students’ additional learning needs, medical conditions, ability to travel independently and their career interests before making a judgement about the best working environment for students.</p>

<h4>Work preparation and pastoral support</h4>

<p>Some SEND students may require a more intense programme of work preparation activities and are likely to need ongoing support during their placement. This may be offered through pastoral support and general work preparation. Providers may use existing funding for this purpose, such as high needs or disadvantage funding, alongside the T Level industry placement funding.</p>

<p>In addition, providers’ on-site facilities, e.g. on-site restaurant, can be used for a maximum of 105 hours of a SEND students’ placement, so long as it is occupationally relevant to students’ occupational specialism at Level 3. This will enable students to prepare for their placement with an external employer, alongside pastoral support. This could include for example, getting used to operating specific equipment; working in teams or with customers; or putting into practice coping strategies to build students’ confidence. This period of on-site provision may also identify non-visible disabilities in some students that may require extra or ongoing pastoral support. In addition to supporting students’ preparation, this initial period is also an opportunity for employers and students to meet. This could help to reassure employers who may be uncertain of the requirements when offering a placement for SEND students, who may have limited experience of the workplace.</p>

<p>It is expected that on-site facilities are only used where it is in the best interests of students and carefully aligned to their learning goals. The rest of the placement must take place with an employer away from the providers’ setting. On-site industry placement provision will be limited to the small number of occupations that can realistically be offered within an institution. It is important that providers use on-site facilities carefully to focus on those who will benefit most.</p>

<p>Where some of the industry placement takes place onsite, providers may consider going beyond the minimum number of placement hours. This will help to ensure students gain the maximum benefit from working with an external employer.</p>

<p>Providers need to produce documented evidence demonstrating that students have special needs, including, but not limited to, those with an EHC plan. This evidence should indicate the need, including referencing formal assessments where available. Providers using this delivery model must complete the industry placement notification form at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex B</a> and keep it for audit purposes. In this form, providers should include the rationale for using this delivery model, the length use of on-site facilities - as 105 hours is an upper limit, not a set amount - and how this addresses the needs of the students.</p>

<p>Providers should consider keeping students’ parents/carers informed as the industry placement plans develop, to help alleviate any concerns they might have about the employer match and the agreed working pattern and daily hours. Providers should also provide them with assurances about the workplace safeguarding arrangements and the support arrangements that will be put in place for students for the duration of their placement. Providers should facilitate a conversation between parents and the employer where it is in the students’ best interest.</p>

<p>Employers might like to refer to the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4403442966290-Supporting-industry-placement-students-with-Special-Educational-Needs-and-Disabilities" rel="external">supporting industry placements with students with SEND</a> for information about the supporting different needs.</p>

<h3>Accommodating students’ other commitments</h3>

<p>It is important to find out about any other significant commitments that students may have as early as possible. For example, caring responsibilities could restrict the number of weekly hours that students can commit to their school/college study time, including their industry placement. This can be managed if identified early. Providers must ensure that the students understand - at the beginning of their T Level course - the commitment required. Providers must also make sure that the placement hours planned into the curriculum are manageable for the students and that prospective employers can accommodate these hours.</p>

<p>Placements are recorded in hours instead of days. This is to allow for different working patterns and shorter days to accommodate other commitments or students’ special needs, for example to avoid travelling during peak times. Providers must be responsive to the students’ needs to make it as easy as possible for them to attend their placement. This includes considering the maximum distance students are able to travel when selecting prospective employers.</p>

<p>There is a comprehensive guide to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015344760-Engaging-students-and-parents-or-guardians-with-industry-placements" rel="external">engaging students and their parents/carers</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015344640-Resolving-challenging-scenarios-with-industry-placements" rel="external">challenging scenarios leaflet</a>. They include methods for dealing with students’ concerns.</p>

<h3>Part-time work</h3>

<p>Where students have part-time work that is related to their occupational specialism, at Level 3, their part-time working hours can be counted towards their industry placement hours, if their employer agrees. As with all industry placements, students and employers will need to sign an industry placement agreement and agree appropriate learning goals that must be used to measure the students’ progress. In addition, the roles and responsibilities for providers and employers that are set out in this guidance, as well as the industry placement completion criteria, will apply. It is expected that students’ salary for part-time work will remain consistent and will not be reduced during their placement.</p>

<h3>Placement hours undertaken outside of the academic timetable</h3>

<p>Placement hours should be delivered in line with the normal working practice and occupational expectations of the industry. Students should be made aware of these expectations and the placement demands, particularly where this is likely to fall outside of the normal academic timetable, as part of the information, advice, and guidance they are given about the T Level. Where relevant, providers must get students’ consent - and where appropriate, parental/carer consent for under 18-year olds - to working weekends, evenings, or early morning shifts and/or during the holidays. Providers are responsible for students’ wellbeing during their time on placement and should arrange for staff to be available and on call throughout.</p>

<h3>Working Time Regulation</h3>

<p>Industry placement hours must align with the Working Time Regulations, particularly if students are undertaking a block placement, where they could be working the equivalent of full-time hours. Providers are responsible for students’ welfare and must ensure that they are not exceeding the maximum number of allowable daily hours. As such, the planning of placement hours must also consider students’ existing part-time working hours. However, priority should be given to the industry placement on the basis that the students have committed to doing the full-time T Level programme.</p>

<p>Planning of placement hours must also consider students’ independent and classroom-based study time and must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be limited to 8 hours of working time a day and 40 hours maximum per week</li>
  <li>not be permitted to work between 10pm and 6am, or you can agree to change this to between 11pm and 7am</li>
  <li>have a 12-hour rest period between each working day</li>
  <li>have a 30-minute rest break if working for more than 4 hours and 30 minutes</li>
  <li>have 2 days weekly rest</li>
</ul>

<h3>Travel considerations</h3>

<p>Providers must consider students’ travel arrangements for accessing their placement and what support they might need. This might include help with travel costs or involve travel training for those students with special needs. It might involve accessing local transport schemes or working with other providers to secure economies of scale in approaches to travel. Providers can use their T Level industry placement funding, or the 16-19 discretionary bursary funds, for funding individual expenses for eligible students. Providers must refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-bursary-fund-guide-2021-to-2022-academic-year">16-19 Bursary Fund Guide</a> for eligibility criteria and use of funding.</p>

<h3>Employer match</h3>

<p>Providers must make sure that the industry placement is the right match for both students and employers. The placement must be linked to the TQ content to provide students with the opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills and behaviours at Level 3, in the workplace.</p>

<p>Providers may encourage students to find their own placement. In this scenario, it is important that providers help students to identify suitable employers that are relevant to their chosen occupational specialism. Providers who encourage students to find their industry placement can refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015340359-Helping-students-to-source-their-own-industry-placements" rel="external">self-sourcing guidance</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that a student does not undertake their placement with a family member or with an employer that they have a close personal affiliation with unless the existing relationship is due to current part-time employment. This is to remove any potential bias when discussing the student’s progress towards their learning goals throughout the placement, and to ensure that students can work with new people. However, where providers are satisfied that the employer can offer the student a meaningful placement - if for example, an agriculture and land-based placement on a family farm - this can be a viable option, as long as the student’s supervisor is not a family member.</p>

<h3>Employer networks</h3>

<p>Providers should use known and trusted employers to host placements, where possible, and continue to build good working relationships with new employers to ensure there are enough high-quality placement opportunities available.</p>

<p>It is important that providers have the appropriate staffing infrastructure in place to enhance their employer networks in their local area and to promote the benefits of industry placements to employers.</p>

<p>It is also important that providers have a sufficient supply of employers to use in the case of placements not working out. Providers can refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359139-How-to-engage-employers-with-industry-placements" rel="external">employer engagement toolkit</a> for helpful advice and tips.</p>

<h3>Employers’ selection processes</h3>

<p>Employers will have their own preferences for selecting students for placements, and this will vary between employers. Where students are selected for interviews, it may be their first formal interview experience so providers must ensure that they are appropriately prepared. It is important to set expectations and ensure employers are aware of students’ pre-existing knowledge and skills, prior experience of work and any other individual circumstances that might affect their performance.</p>

<p>It is likely that there may be some competition for placements in organisations that are considered big household names and/or across some industries. Providers must ensure that all students with the relevant knowledge, skills and behaviours have access to any selection process for roles. Employers also have legal duties under the Equality Act that prohibits them from discriminating against any protected characteristics in the selection process.</p>

<p>As a minimum requirement there should be some communication between students and employers before placements start. This will help to manage expectations and prevent any issues from occurring later down the line. It is recommended that that this is supplemented with a workplace visit to meet the teams that students will be working with and given a tour of the premises.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359219-Matching-students-to-the-best-employer" rel="external">placement matching document</a> contains a mock interview template, alongside guidance about other engagement and selection methods.</p>

<h3>Industry placement objectives template</h3>

<h4>Completing the template</h4>

<p>To ensure students undertake high-quality industry placements, providers should work with employers to complete the industry placement objectives template. Published alongside this guidance are example industry placement objective templates for most of the T Level occupational specialisms.</p>

<p>The example industry placement objective templates, which are grouped by T Level route, have been developed by the T Level panels to help providers and employers design the placement. Providers are not required to use these examples. Instead, they have been developed to give providers and employers an indication of what industry placement objectives, learning goals and typical activities could be set. The templates include the following information which must be discussed and agreed between the provider, student, and employer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Role title</strong> – this section should outline the student’s role title</li>
  <li>
<strong>Working pattern</strong> – this section should outline the student’s agreed working pattern e.g. block, day release, mixed model</li>
  <li>
<strong>Placement duration</strong> – this section should outline the agreed placement duration, in hours</li>
  <li>
<strong>Objective(s)</strong> – this section should briefly summarise the overall role of the student and the contribution they will make to the organisation during the placement so there is clear understanding of the student’s role by the provider, student and employer</li>
  <li>
<strong>Typical activities</strong> - this section should outline the key activities and tasks the student will carry out during the placement that will help them achieve the overall placement objective. Where possible, the activities and tasks’ frequency may also be reflected e.g. per week / for the duration of the placement</li>
  <li>
<strong>Learning goals</strong> – this section should identify the key technical and employability skills that the student must focus on developing and honing throughout their placement. A mix of technical and employability skills must be agreed, with a minimum of 3 each. This section can also detail the relevant knowledge that the student should be able to apply in the workplace context</li>
  <li>
<strong>Minimum starting requirements</strong> – this section should detail any agreed starting requirements e.g. health and safety checks, DBS checks and immunisations etc that providers will ensure the student undertakes/is equipped with before the start of the placement</li>
  <li>
<strong>Suggested prior learning</strong> – this section should detail any important prior skills, knowledge, or behaviours that the student should have covered during their course in advance of the placement</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the minimum starting requirements and suggested prior learning, providers should also refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex D</a> that lists supplementary recommendations for some T Level industry placements e.g. where health checks, food and hygiene training, and construction site cards etc, could be beneficial to some students depending on their intended progression following their T Level course.</p>

<h4>Typical activities</h4>

<p>Students’ industry placement objectives template must include a set of activities that they will undertake whilst on their placement.</p>

<p>Before starting their placements, students will be expected to have already begun to develop occupational knowledge and skills, which they can apply and further develop in the workplace. The activities should be linked to the corresponding skills and knowledge in TQ content to ensure that they are suitable.</p>

<p>Providers should agree the activities with employers and can use the typical activities outlined in the relevant industry placement objectives templates as a guide, adapting them as necessary to meet the needs of the workplace and/or the stage of students’ development. Employers will also need to consider the level of supervision required for each of the agreed activities. As the placement continues, providers and employers should review the activities and introduce additional activities to reflect students’ progress towards their learning goals.</p>

<h4>Learning goals</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, students’ industry placement objectives template must include a set of stretching learning goals. Examples of learning goals are included in the example industry placement objective templates that have been published alongside this guidance.</p>

<p>The industry placement is an integral component of the students’ technical curriculum and is not a ‘bolt-on’ component. Therefore, the setting of industry placement learning goals should be done by the teacher with responsibility for the students’ technical study programme. This enables them to best sequence the students’ learning opportunities before, during and after the placement. Providers should also make sure that employers are involved in developing the learning goals, making sure they correspond directly to the content of the TQ and link to the typical activities that the student will do on their placement, to ensure students have appropriate opportunities to develop their technical skills.</p>

<p>The learning goals must be agreed between students, providers, and employers, in advance of the placements starting. For some students, providers may also want to seek agreement from the students’ parents/carers where additional assurances are required.</p>

<h4>Suggested process for completing the industry placement objectives template</h4>

<p>Below is a process that providers can follow to help develop the industry placement objectives template with employers. It is only a suggested process and the activities do not have to be conducted in the same order:</p>

<p><strong>1. Review the T Level content</strong> - providers should review the TQ specification and the guidance on assessment from the awarding body, to understand what the students should know, and what they should be able to do as a result of completing the T Level, and determine the type of skills that can be developed and evidenced in a particular placement</p>

<p><strong>2. Use the TQ specification and awarding body guidance to create a shortlist of potential skills and knowledge that students could best hone through an industry placement</strong> - providers must consider technical skills and knowledge as well as employability skills. Early engagement with prospective employers at this stage might be appropriate to ensure that the skills and knowledge needs match what the employer can offer</p>

<p><strong>3. Consider the course delivery model and curriculum planning</strong> – to plan when placements should take place and sequence learning to equip students with sufficient knowledge and skills to undertake a meaningful placement and build on this learning. This is also key to ensuring sufficient time is built in for students to undertake any suggested prior learning and that they can complete the full placement duration</p>

<p><strong>4. Student engagement</strong> – hold discussions with students to identify the technical and employability skills that they would most benefit from further developing in a placement context, to progress into skilled employment in their field of study. The students’ interests and career ambitions may also be considered to better inform placement selection. If possible, review any formative feedback to support the identification of specific knowledge and skills they need to develop further</p>

<p><strong>5. Employer engagement</strong> - share the shortlist of potential skills and knowledge to be developed during the placements with potential employers to help them identify the opportunities that they could offer. Determine and record the skills and knowledge that students may be able to develop through a placement with each employer. Also, note the suggested prior learning and minimum starting requirements that each employer would require a student to complete before the placement. The relevant sample industry placement objectives template could be used to support this conversation</p>

<p><strong>6. Match students with employers</strong> - use information gathered on the potential students, in terms of their skill gaps, interests and aspirations, and from the employers, in terms of the opportunity they can offer, to match the students and employers accordingly</p>

<p><strong>7. Agree the content of the industry placement objectives template</strong> - providers, employers and students discuss and agree the content of the industry placement objectives template. The conversation should be structured around the headings given in the template: role title, working pattern, duration, objective(s), typical activities, learning goals, minimum starting requirements and suggested prior learning. Providers should then write these up in a template to be shared with the student and employer for further input and approval. Ultimately, they should be embedded within the industry placement agreement that is signed by all 3 parties</p>

<p><strong>8. Ensure students are equipped with any suggested prior learning in advance of their placement and that they meet the starting requirements set by the employers</strong> - consider whether there are any gaps in the suggested prior learning or mandatory starting requirements agreed with the employers and review timetabling to ensure these can be achieved before the start of the placements</p>

<p>This process can be adapted to reflect normal practice. For example, for the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, the templates should include and align with any additional occupational specialist requirements, set by the awarding organisation, to meet particular skills elements, some of which will be assessed in the workplace.</p>

<h4>Progress indicators</h4>

<p>The progress indicators set out the expected standards relating to technical skills and work-based behaviours that students should develop whilst on placement. They are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex F</a>.</p>

<p>The progress indicators are a tool that can be used by providers and employers to help inform their review of students’ progress towards their learning goals throughout the placement by highlighting where students are performing well and identifying areas for improvement. They can also be used to assist with providers’ overall judgement of students’ progress towards their learning goals at the end of the placement. <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">Section 4</a> gives more detail on how they can be used to do this.</p>

<p>In the case of student appeals or complaints, providers may also find that reviewing the students’ progress against the progress indicators provides useful evidence as to where the students have not demonstrated progress or appropriate behaviour.</p>

<h4>Paying students</h4>

<p>T Level industry placements are about providing students with high-quality, meaningful training, not work. Therefore, students on an industry placement are not entitled to a salary because the placement forms part of a 16-19 education and training programme<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> . As such, there is no legal requirement or expectation that T Level students will be paid, and providers should make this clear to students as well as employers. However, we recognise that for some employers, any type of unpaid placement would discourage them from hosting placements, so they are able to pay students should they wish to. This must be agreed up front. Employers may wish to refer to guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4403450119826-Making-payments-to-industry-placement-students" rel="external">making payments to students</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, employers can help contribute towards the cost of the students’ travel, lunch, and clothing/equipment. Where employers choose not to contribute to student expenses, providers may use their T Level industry placement funding or the 16-19 discretionary bursary funds to cover travel and subsistence costs, to ensure the students are not financially disadvantaged by undertaking their placements.</p>

<p>The requirement for students to undertake industry placements as part of a T Level, does not contravene the Modern Slavery Act, as these circumstances do not fall within the definitions of forced or compulsory labour<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. Whilst industry placements are an integral part of the T Level programme for students to receive full T Level certification, students are aware of this requirement when they sign up to the programme. If a situation arises where students no longer want to attend their placement, they have freedom to withdraw at any time and will instead receive a statement of achievement for the T Level components they have achieved.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>T Level industry placement agreement</h3>

<p>Before the student’s placement starts, the student, provider and employer must sign the industry placement agreement to secure all parties agreement and commitment to the placement. The industry placement agreement template is at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex E</a>. It is good practice for the student’s parents/carers to have sight of this document and whilst not compulsory, it may be beneficial for them to sign it, so providers have assurance that they also have the student’s parental/carer consent and support.</p>

<p>By signing the commitment statement within the industry placement agreement, the student agrees to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fulfil their key roles and responsibilities</li>
  <li>undertake the placement hours at the days and times specified</li>
  <li>demonstrate sufficient progress towards their learning goals and in doing so, develop their technical skills to the best of their ability</li>
  <li>demonstrate the expected behaviours in the workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers must ensure each student’s industry placement agreement contains the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the student’s unique placement details including the employer details</li>
  <li>the student’s weekly hours, start and finish times, and duration</li>
  <li>the student’s learning goals, key tasks and activities, and progress indicators and the professional workplace behaviours and attitudes, so they can continually refer to them to self-assess their performance against these criteria</li>
  <li>the key point of contact within the provider for the student and employer during the placement</li>
  <li>the student’s key responsibilities such as, arriving on time, reporting sickness, agreeing to attend regular review meetings with their provider and employer, and updating their student logbook</li>
  <li>the consequences if students are unable to meet these expectations</li>
</ul>

<p>A signed copy of the industry placement agreement must be retained alongside all other evidence collected during the placement by providers. This agreement may be used as a formal record of the details of the industry placement, to supplement the student’s T Level Certificate and the employer appraisal and can be used by the student when they seek skilled employment.</p>

<p>The industry placement agreement in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex E</a> can be adapted locally and can be kept electronically, however it must include all the components outlined above. Providers must ensure that any documentation that is used by students is produced in an appropriate format, so they are accessible for those with special educational needs.</p>
</div>

<h3>Provider and employer responsibilities regarding safeguarding and protection against discrimination</h3>

<p>Providers and employers must work together to ensure the students’ safety during industry placements. Employers and providers must adhere to their legal obligations under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">Equality Act 2010</a>. As part of their pre-placement checks, providers must satisfy themselves that employers have up-to-date policies and sufficient risk management arrangements in place to ensure a safe working environment for students.</p>

<h4>Reasonable adjustments</h4>

<p>As part of the Equality Act, providers must make reasonable adjustments for disabled students to enable them to commence and perform their industry placements without substantial disadvantage in comparison with students who are not disabled. Employers should consider the reasonable adjustments required by students with SEND. Relevant information about a student’s disability and needs should be shared by the provider with the employer with the student’s consent. As appropriate, the provider, employer and student should discuss and arrange reasonable adjustments before the industry placement commences and those adjustments may require ongoing review.</p>

<p>Examples of possible reasonable adjustments are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/multipage-guide/reasonable-adjustments-practice" rel="external">Codes of Practice and technical guidance issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission</a>. Also, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/disability/index.htm" rel="external">HSE website</a> provides health and safety guidance for disabled people in the workplace.</p>

<h4>Health and safety</h4>

<p>Employers are responsible for health and safety in the workplace and providers are responsible for safeguarding the welfare of students whilst on industry placements.</p>

<p>It is important that providers keep checks and monitoring proportionate to the level of risk. For low risk environments, assurance can be gained through a conversation between the employer and the provider. Physical inspections by providers or completing lengthy forms is not necessary. A standard employer due diligence checklist is provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex G</a>. A copy of this completed documentation must be retained for monitoring purposes by the department.</p>

<p>Providers and employers must be familiar with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015345000-Health-and-safety-insurance-and-safeguarding-for-industry-placements" rel="external">Health &amp; safety, safeguarding and insurance guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/youngpeople/workexperience/organiser.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive guidance</a> that covers their responsibilities in more detail.</p>

<p>Providers must ensure that employers are aware of their responsibilities about safety in the workplace to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a safe learning environment for all students</li>
  <li>have a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying and harassment</li>
  <li>ensure they report all incidents to their provider contact</li>
  <li>be alert to the possibility of abuse among their employees and students</li>
  <li>ensure that any agreed reasonable adjustments have been put in place</li>
</ul>

<h4>Protecting students’ welfare in the workplace</h4>

<p>Providers should support students to feel empowered to speak out if they experience inappropriate behaviour in the workplace. As part of students’ preparation for their placement, it is expected that providers cover how to deal with any instances of bullying or inappropriate conduct and how to raise concerns with them, so they can intervene, as necessary. Students should also feel comfortable raising any concerns with the employer.</p>

<p>It is recommended that providers offer basic child protection training to employers offering industry placements. This will help to ensure that best practice methods are observed, such as working in an open environment, consider the location and visibility of one-to-one meetings, and avoiding unnecessary physical contact. Providers should share the contact details of their safeguarding lead to employers so that they can be contacted to help, if required.</p>

<h4>Employer Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)</h4>

<p>Generally, employers are not legally obliged to carry out a basic, standard, or enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check on members of staff supervising young people aged 16 or 17. This includes freelancers. Providers may request that the students’ manager or supervisor within the employer undergo a basic DBS check in situations where they feel this is necessary. Where students are considered vulnerable, for example, they have SEND, or have been in care, or where they are likely to be alone regularly with the adult as part of their placement, it is expected practice to request a DBS check. Providers and employers should agree on an ad-hoc basis who meets these costs.</p>

<h4>Student DBS checks</h4>

<p>Students may need to have an enhanced DBS check before starting an industry placement in certain industries, for example in early years occupations where the employer would need to check that students are not barred from regulated activity relating to children. Providers must cover these costs from the T Level industry placement funding.</p>

<h4>Commercial confidentially</h4>

<p>In some industries, students may be exposed to commercially sensitive or confidential information during their placement. If it is normal practice to put clauses in place to protect the business, then it is recommended that employers follow the same principles for students, as they do with employees. Employers may decide to draw up a confidentiality statement for the student to sign. Although not legally binding, it could give employers peace of mind and confirm to the student how important confidentiality is to their business.</p>

<h4>Employers’ liability insurance</h4>

<p>Employers need to hold up-to-date Employers’ Liability Insurance (ELI) and must notify their insurer about the placement. If employers do not already have ELI, they need to have this in place before the placement begins and for the full duration of the placement. Providers must check employers have adequate insurance cover. If the employers’ insurer is a member of ABI, or Lloyds, ELI policies already cover placements. Employers can refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/get.htm" rel="external">getting insurance for your business</a> for more advice.</p>

<h4>Manager or supervisor of the student</h4>

<p>Employers must identify an appropriate task manager and/or supervisor. This should ideally be someone who has experience in training within the specialist area. They must have the capacity to hold regular 1 to 1s with the students, provide them with feedback and attend the recommended 3 formal review meetings, i.e. at the beginning, middle and end of the placement.</p>

<h3>Providers’ internal monitoring and quality assurance of industry placement provision</h3>

<p>Providers must ensure that they have robust internal monitoring and quality assurance measures in place. This is to ensure that the internal infrastructure is set up to deliver high-quality industry placements. It also enables providers to satisfy themselves that employers are complying with their responsibilities.</p>

<p>As a minimum requirement, providers must ensure that sufficient safeguarding and quality assurance measures are in place, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>industry placement coordinators are experienced in carrying out employer due diligence checks and following safeguarding protocol</li>
  <li>providers have the expertise to draw up stretching learning goals, as part of the industry placement objectives template and to review student progress</li>
  <li>there is careful consideration about the timing of placements within the curriculum planning, and evidence that employers are engaged to take students on placements</li>
  <li>the verification of industry placements is built into the institution’s internal industry placement quality assurance process to ensure judgements about completion are accurate and consistent and the evidence is of the right standard</li>
  <li>there are staff in place to verify add data industry placement data to the Manage T Level results service</li>
  <li>mechanisms for reporting of feedback from the employer and student are built into the industry placement quality assurance process and taken into consideration</li>
</ul>

<p>The effectiveness of the industry placement processes must be reviewed regularly, and continuous improvement must be embedded within the end-to-end process.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Summary of roles and responsibilities: pre-placement</h3>

<h3>Provider responsibilities</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Inform students and their parents/carers about the expectations of the T Level industry placement and gain their commitment before enrolment onto the T Level programme</li>
  <li>Ensure that the curriculum design and sequencing of learning prior to the placement, including work preparation, equips students with the sufficient knowledge and skills to undertake a meaningful placement</li>
  <li>Plan the placement hours early enough in the T Level programme to allow sufficient time for students to make up any shortfall in hours if they’ve been off for any reason during their placement, before the end of the 2-year programme</li>
  <li>Develop a good network of existing and new employer contacts to host placements and ensure there is a sufficient supply of employers to use in the case of placement breakdowns. Where students choose to self-source, providers must oversee this process</li>
  <li>Consider the students’ personal circumstances and learning needs before matching them to an employer</li>
  <li>Ensure that students have undertaken appropriate work-preparation training and are ready to start their placement</li>
  <li>Support employers with their own selection process if required, for example by shortlisting potential candidates, using student information, e.g. their skill gaps, interests and aspirations, and employer information e.g. in terms of the opportunity they can offer, to match students and employers accordingly</li>
  <li>Work collaboratively with employers to populate each student’s industry placement objectives template, ensuring it includes a set of stretching learning goals, the agreed working pattern, key activities relevant to the occupational specialism at Level 3 - with the exception of route-level placements - minimum starting requirements and the required prior knowledge of the students</li>
  <li>Carry out due diligence checks on employers to satisfy themselves that they have up to date health and safety policies and the appropriate safeguards in place</li>
  <li>Ensure that the provider, students, and employers have signed-up and are committed to the responsibilities detailed in the industry placement agreement, and the students’ parents/carers have provided their consent</li>
  <li>Ensure that an appropriate support structure and reasonable adjustments are in place for SEND students to access placements and the relevant information about their disability and needs are shared with the employer with the student’s consent</li>
  <li>Check employers’ compliance with health and safety legislation and that they hold up to date employers’ liability insurance. Providers must be satisfied that the appropriate student safeguards are in place to ensure a safe working environment</li>
  <li>Carry out checks to ensure the internal quality assurance requirements are delivered in compliance with the responsibilities set out in this document</li>
</ol>

<h3>Employer responsibilities</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Work collaboratively with providers to develop the students’ industry placement objectives template, ensuring it includes a set of stretching learning goals, the agreed working pattern and key activities the student will be undertaking on placement relevant to the occupational specialism at Level 3, the minimum starting requirements and the required prior knowledge of the students</li>
  <li>Comply with health and safety legislation and maintain up-to-date employer’s liability and public liability insurance to cover the students and any potential loss or liability caused by or to the students in relation to the placement</li>
  <li>Sign the industry placement agreement and commit to adhering to the guidelines set out in this guidance and provide a meaningful placement experience for the student</li>
  <li>Ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure a safe working environment for students</li>
  <li>Consider the reasonable adjustments required by students with SEND</li>
  <li>Identify an appropriate staff member to task manage or supervise the students while on placement. This should ideally be someone who has experience in training within the specialist area</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Section 3: During the industry placement</h2>

<h3>Provider support and communication to employers</h3>

<p>Providers must complete all the administrative tasks related to the placement. This includes planning the structure of the placement, supporting the student selection process, arranging the review meetings, guiding employers through the necessary paperwork, and advising on reasonable adjustments. This support must be in place to help minimise the resource burden on employers and to provide employers with the necessary guidance and support to ensure that they are well-prepared and equipped to deliver high-quality placements.</p>

<p>It is important that providers have regular communication with employers before the placement starts and throughout the placement. Employers must be given a named contact at the provider’s setting, and this must be someone who is able to respond to the employer promptly. This will enable any issues relating to student attendance and/or student behaviour or ability to be identified and resolved quickly so placements are able to continue without compromising their quality. It also helps to maintain good relationships with employers that could be relied on for future placements.</p>

<h3>Workplace induction</h3>

<p>Employers are responsible for conducting a full workplace induction on day one of the placement to cover all health and safety aspects of their workplace. Employers may use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359739-Student-induction-checklist" rel="external">induction checklist</a> to help them know what to cover. Employers should consider giving students a refresher of this information later in the placement.</p>

<h3>Management and training of young people in the workplace</h3>

<p>Employers need to be mindful that students are aged between 16 and 19 and, as such, may have limited experience of the real-life pressures and responsibilities of working in a busy work environment. It is important that students have a structured, meaningful learning experience throughout the placement, to keep them motivated to do their best. Employers might adjust the level of supervision/support to allow students to develop their technical skills independently, such as allowing them to take ownership of live projects. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4403442912402-Roles-and-responsibilities-supporting-learners-on-their-placement" rel="external">supporting learners on their placement</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4403450113426-Helping-students-learn" rel="external">helping students to learn</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4403450099090-Managing-young-people-who-are-new-to-the-workplace" rel="external">managing young people who are new to the workplace</a> may be useful resources for employers. In addition, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability-confident-and-cipd-guide-for-line-managers-on-employing-people-with-a-disability-or-health-condition">Disability Confident</a>) and CIPD guidance, is also helpful reading for line managers of young people with a disability or health condition.</p>

<h3>Workplace mentor</h3>

<p>It is recommended that employers assign students a work-based mentor. Having access to this type of informal working relationship may help students settle in more quickly and provide them with someone, akin to a peer, to communicate with, enhancing their overall experience in the workplace. Good practice suggests that qualified individuals who were previously an apprentice in the same organisation can make good candidates for this role.</p>

<h3>Review meetings</h3>

<p>Providers are responsible for safeguarding and promoting students’ welfare while on placement and ensuring they are supported in progressing towards their learning goals. To support this, providers must arrange a minimum of 3 review meetings with the students and employers. It is suggested that the first review meeting takes place at the beginning of the placement, the second at the middle of the placement and the final one at the end of the placement. At the final review, a decision must be made about whether the student has met the completion criteria and, thereby, completed their placement.</p>

<p>It is good practice for providers to conduct at least 2 of the review meetings face-to-face. However, providers have the discretion to decide whether the meetings are conducted face-to-face, virtually or by telephone, if they are satisfied with the safeguarding and welfare of their students.</p>

<p>Where students do their placement with 2 employers, providers must plan the review meetings appropriately to ensure the students’ performance is reviewed against their learning goals across both working environments. Both employers, however, should write an appraisal of the students’ performance during their time on placement.</p>

<p>The content of the review meetings must be recorded by providers and retained to inform decisions regarding the students’ completion of their industry placement. This can also be used as evidence in the case of any appeals from students. Providers can use and adapt this standard <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359799-Template-for-final-review-of-industry-placement-student" rel="external">final review meeting template</a> for this purpose. This documentation will also be subject to monitoring checks by the department.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>The purpose of the review meeting is to:</h4>

<p>1: Check the students have received an induction and are clear about the employers’ health and safety protocols; ensure the students have settled into their respective workplaces and developed good working relationships with their supervisors and/or workplace mentors; and check with students that the placements are meeting their expectations and the employer matches are working well. Providers must also ensure that any reasonable adjustments put in place for students with SEND or mental health conditions are working well and kept under review.</p>

<p>2: Check the appropriateness of, and progress towards, the students’ learning goals to ensure they have suitably stretching activities that are supporting the development of their technical skills. The learning goals must be reviewed and updated to make them more stretching if necessary. Providers and employers may use the progress indicators in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex F</a> to help inform their discussion about the students’ progress towards their learning goals and whether they are demonstrating the expected standards relating to their technical skills and work-based behaviours. These should be constructive conversations and employers must be prepared to discuss how the students are performing, based on their observations.</p>

<p>3: Check the students’ wellbeing by making sure that they are not being over or under-worked; they have manageable working patterns; they have built good working relationships and that they are content with their placement experiences.</p>

<p>4: Discuss any issues/challenges directly with the students and employers. Students must be advised as early as possible if they are not meeting any of the conditions set out in their industry placement agreements or where the employers have concerns about their progress towards their learning goals. Providers will be expected to take action to resolve any issues quickly and with full transparency, so students are clear about the necessary areas for improvement.</p>
</div>

<h3>Frequency of less formal review points</h3>

<p>Providers should supplement the review meetings with less formal contact time with students and/or employers. Providers can decide on the most appropriate communication method, which might include face to face, telephone, email, skype or text. The frequency of this contact is at providers’ discretion and will depend on the needs of students and the placement model, e.g. whether it is a block model, or one or 2 days a week. Providers must prioritise students that need additional support or where employers or students have raised concerns. Providers may also want to have more regular contact time with students in rural placement settings where they may feel more isolated. Providers must also make sure they operate an ‘open door’ policy for students to raise any issues or concerns about being harassed or bullied in the workplace, so they can intervene quickly.</p>

<h3>Providing real-time feedback</h3>

<p>Employers should provide students with constructive feedback throughout the placement rather than waiting for formal review points. This will help to keep students motivated and will ensure that they can act quickly to rectify mistakes and continuously develop whilst on placement. Employers can refer to guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359799-Template-for-final-review-of-industry-placement-student" rel="external">helping students learn</a> for advice.</p>

<h3>Student logbooks</h3>

<p>To ensure that there is an accurate record of the placement, it is expected that students keep an industry placement logbook throughout their placement. It must contain the placement details, including hours and timesheets, and progress towards learning goals. Students should share their logbooks with the employer, so that the employer can apply light-touch monitoring to verify the content is an accurate representation.</p>

<p>Providers and employers must provide opportunities for students to reflect on their personal and technical development and update their logbook on a regular basis. The logbook should be a ‘‘live’’ document throughout the placement so that students can record and track progress, including reflections, photos, and written feedback on an ongoing basis. Providers must check that students are completing their logbook at regular intervals.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015345420-Industry-placement-logbook-for-students" rel="external">student logbook template</a> is available. This can be adapted locally but should contain the same content. Some providers may choose to use online applications or software packages for student placement tracking and recording purposes. This is acceptable, as long as the employer can access students’ record to verify certain aspects, such as timesheets. Providers are responsible for adapting the documentation, so it is in an accessible format for their students with different needs.</p>

<h3>Travel time, lunch breaks and public holidays</h3>

<p>Providers must advise students about how to record their industry placement hours in the timesheet within their logbook. The guidelines are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where students’ commute time to the employer premises exceeds one hour each way, one hour of travelling time can be included in the daily hours</li>
  <li>the students’ daily working hours should exclude lunch breaks</li>
  <li>public holidays can be counted towards the students’ working hours if this is a normal working pattern for the employer and students have agreed to work it</li>
</ul>

<p>It is recommended that employers check students’ timesheet on a weekly basis to ensure that the hours recorded are a true reflection of the hours worked.</p>

<h3>Accounting for short-term sickness in attendance record</h3>

<p>Providers must ensure that students know how to record time off due to sickness during their industry placement. Up to 35 hours sickness over the duration of the placement can be included in the placement hours.</p>

<p>Where students’ sickness exceeds 35 hours or students are off long-term, providers must make arrangements for them to make up the additional time - over and above the 35 hours - and complete the minimum placement hours requirement, before 31 July in their second year. This can either be with the same employer or arrangements can be made for them to make up the required hours with a different employer.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">Section 5</a> provides guidance on when special consideration can be applied in some exceptional circumstances where students have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals but have not completed the minimum number of placement hours. It also provides guidance on allowing students to continue their placement hours for 2 years after the 2-year T Level programme in extenuating circumstances to enable them to complete their T Level.</p>

<p>In the case of students not being able to complete their placements for reasons such as employers going into administration and withdrawing their offer, the expectation is that providers will endeavour to make alternative arrangements with a different employer. This may, in some rare instances, mean students working across 3 employers, where a placement was initially planned to be split across 2 employers. The accumulative placement hours completed with the 3 employers should be counted and the students’ progress reviewed at each workplace should be documented.</p>

<h3>Disputes and issue resolution</h3>

<p>It is important that providers have policies and procedures in place to manage complaints, disputes or issues raised by employers and/or students during the placement.</p>

<p>Employers and students must be made aware of the providers’ internal complaints, disputes, and issue resolution procedures during the pre-placement conversations. The procedures must clearly set out how complaints, disputes or issues should be raised, how they will be dealt with, including timescales, and what actions may be taken as a result. Providers must handle all complaints, disputes, and issues in a sensitive, transparent, and timely manner to avoid them from escalating and/or employers withdrawing the placements.</p>

<p>Employers and students who wish to make a complaint about providers should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complaints-about-post-16-education-and-training-provision-funded-by-esfa/complaints-about-post-16-education-and-training-provision-funded-by-esfa">department’s complaints procedure about post 16 education and training provision</a>. It is expected that this will be used as a last resort, and only when issues have not been satisfactorily resolved between the parties.</p>

<h3>Managing student concerns and complaints</h3>

<p>Students should feel comfortable raising concerns with their provider about the quality of their placement, inappropriate employer conduct or safeguarding issues, and be confident that their provider will take their concerns seriously, investigating and taking action as required. Students’ complaints should be managed through providers’ internal complaints procedures. All complaints must be taken seriously and should include a full investigation if the severity of the complaint warrants it. Students must also be clear about the consequences of their actions.</p>

<h3>Managing students who are under-performing</h3>

<p>Under no circumstances should students be allowed to start their placement if providers have any concerns regarding their behaviour. This could have a severe impact on the quality of the placement, risk them not completing their placement, and impact on employers’ commitment to invest in students and offer future placements. As addressed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a>, it is providers’ responsibility to ensure that students are appropriately prepared for the workplace, ahead of their placement commencing.</p>

<p>During the placement, any issues regarding students’ behaviour should be raised as early as possible. The expectation is that students who display poor behaviour will be managed through the providers’ behaviour policy. Providers must have procedures and systems in place to tackle any underlying issues with students and offer further support/mentoring where appropriate, to help students continue with, and complete, their placement. Providers must support an employer’s decision to withdraw their placement offer if the situation remains unsatisfactory. <a class="govuk-link" href="#section4">Section 4</a> outlines the industry placement completion criteria and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a> outlines what providers must do if students have not been able to complete the minimum placement hours before the end of the second year of the T Level programme.</p>

</div>

<h2>Section 4: Post-placement</h2>

<h3>Confirming industry placement completion</h3>

<p>Providers are ultimately responsible for deciding whether students have satisfactorily completed their industry placements, based on whether they have met the completion criteria, as outlined below. Providers must use their professional judgement in making their decisions, incorporating the employers’ feedback, and must make sure that their decisions are evidenced.</p>

<h3>Industry placement completion criteria</h3>

<p>Industry placements must meet the completion criteria set out below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>1:  Students have <strong>demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals</strong>, using the progress indicators at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex F</a> as a guide</p>

<p>2:  Students have <strong>worked directly for an external employer</strong>, outside their normal learning environment away from their peers and teaching staff (except for students with SEND or in Young Offender Institutions where alternative approaches can be applied)</p>

<p>3: Students have been on the placement for a <strong>minimum of 315 hours</strong> (or 750 hours for the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, within the Education and Childcare T Level)</p>
</div>

<h3>Progress indicators</h3>

<p>One of the key criteria for students to complete their industry placement is that they must have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals. Providers can use the progress indicators in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex F</a> to help inform their review of the students’ progress throughout the placement and the providers’ overall judgement of the students’ progress at the end of the placement.</p>

<p>It is suggested that for students to be judged as demonstrating sufficient progress towards their learning goals at the end of the placement, they should be meeting - at a minimum - the ‘good’ progress indicators in the majority of the ‘Behaviours’ and ‘Technical Ability’ categories outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex F</a>. There may also be other factors that providers consider to help inform their judgement.</p>

<p>Employers are expected to contribute to students’ review meetings and providers’ decisions as to whether students have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals at the end of the placement. Where students have been on placement with 2 employers, the evidence of their progress against their learning goals must be reviewed at the review meetings with each of the employers.</p>

<p>In the case of student appeals or complaints, providers may also find that reviewing the students’ progress against the progress indicators provides useful evidence as to where they have not demonstrated progress or appropriate behaviour.</p>

<h3>Signed declaration of student completion</h3>

<p>At the final review meetings, providers and employers must sign the industry placement completion declaration to confirm that the students have met the industry placement completion criteria. The declaration is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex H</a>. Where 2 employers have been used, both should sign the student completion declaration form.</p>

<h3>Employer appraisal</h3>

<p>At the end of the placements, employers are expected to provide an appraisal of the students’ performance, including how they have demonstrated progress towards their learning goals. If placements are conducted across 2 employers, each employer must provide an appraisal, to reflect the students’ achievements with them. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360015359799-Template-for-final-review-of-industry-placement-student" rel="external">employer appraisal template</a> can be used, or it can be adapted locally.</p>

<h3>Evidence to support completion decision</h3>

<p>Providers must collect evidence during the placements to decide whether students have completed their placements. As a minimum the following documentation must be collated for students, in electronic or paper copy format, and retained for 3 years, for monitoring purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Signed industry placement agreement (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex E</a>)</li>
  <li>Learning goals outlined as part of the industry placement objectives template</li>
  <li>Completed student logbook</li>
  <li>Evidence of discussions at the formal review points, including a record of student progress against their learning goals</li>
  <li>Signed industry placement completion declaration form (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex H</a>)</li>
  <li>SEND evidence (where applicable)</li>
  <li>Employer appraisal</li>
</ol>

<p>Many providers use digital tracking and reporting software and we encourage the use of this to reduce the need for hard copies of paperwork to be kept. All the templates and forms provided as annexes with this guidance, therefore, can be adapted locally and kept electronically. Providers must, however, ensure they include all the components and content outlined in the original templates and forms.</p>

<h3>Definition of non-completion</h3>

<p>Students cannot be confirmed by providers as completing the industry placement if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have <strong>not demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals</strong>
</li>
  <li>they have <strong>not completed the minimum hours required</strong>
</li>
  <li>the placement has <strong>not been external to their normal learning environment</strong> and away from peers and teaching staff, except for students with SEND or those in Young Offender Institutions where alternative approaches can be applied and/or</li>
  <li>
<strong>they choose to withdraw</strong> from their industry placement early, and/or withdraw from education</li>
</ul>

<p>In rare circumstances where students have been unable to meet the 315-hour requirement due to factors beyond their control, they could be eligible for special consideration or allowed to make up their hours after the 2-year programme. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section5">section 5</a> on completion exceptions.</p>

<h3>Failure to demonstrate progress towards learning goals</h3>

<p>Providers are responsible for deciding whether students have completed their placement or not, and they must consider the feedback from employers when making this decision. The expectation is that students not completing their placement will be an uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p>Employers and providers should be alert to issues that may result in students not being able to meet the completion criteria early in the placement so that they can addressed as soon as possible. Students must be clear on why they are not meeting expectations and given the necessary support to rectify this. Where students do not respond positively, even when additional support has been provided, providers must use their professional judgement to determine the appropriate next steps.</p>

<h3>Student acceptance of job and apprenticeship offer</h3>

<p>It is important that students complete their industry placement alongside all other T Level components and be awarded a T Level certificate. This will support their onward progression and help their future employment prospects.</p>

<p>Providers should ensure that students and employers understand the benefits of a student completing their T Level before progressing to full-time paid employment. However, where students choose to leave their industry placement early, this counts as a student withdrawal or ‘non-completion.’ Providers must record this on the ILR/school census and the Manage T Level results service. Providers also need to inform the awarding organisation that the student has withdrawn from the course.</p>

<p>It is recognised that students being offered paid employment or an apprenticeship with the employer is a good outcome. Where students have completed all other T Level components, they can choose to accept the offer and complete their industry placement hours as a paid employee or an apprentice. The industry placement responsibilities will still apply: students will need to work towards achieving their learning goals; providers will still need to arrange contact time with the students; and the final review point must still go ahead, to confirm the students have met the completion criteria. This is to enable students to accept offers of employment or an apprenticeship whilst also ensuring they meet the placement completion criteria and are awarded the full T Level Certificate.</p>

<h3>Student appeals process</h3>

<p>As with other 16-19 education and training programmes, providers must have an existing internal student appeals process to deal with student complaints or appeals about the industry placement completion decision. Providers have a responsibility to treat all student appeals seriously and they must be followed-up promptly.</p>

<p>Providers must have all the required documentation in place to draw on if students are disputing the decision about their completion status, in particular the written record of the discussions at each of the review meetings.</p>

<h3>Employer and student feedback</h3>

<p>To enhance the industry placement offer, providers must actively seek feedback from students and employers about their experiences of the end-to-end process. This evidence must be fed back to the appropriate staff members to support their Continuous Professional Development (CPD) requirements and be built into the institution’s continuous improvement process. Providers can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://employers.tlevels.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/4403450123538-End-of-placement-review-with-the-provider" rel="external">end of placement review form</a> to obtain feedback from employers and can be adapted to incorporate employer feedback on student work-readiness, as discussed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section2">section 2</a>.</p>

<h3>Recording student completion on the ILR and School Census</h3>

<p>Providers must refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">ILR provider support manual</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-census-2021-to-2022-technical-information">School census 2021 to 2022: technical information</a> on how to complete the industry placement learning aim data correctly.</p>

<p>Students are expected to complete their industry placement by the end of the 2-year programme. If students started their T Level at the beginning of the academic year providers must complete the industry placement data fields on the ILR and schools census by <strong>31 July in the students’ second academic year</strong> to account for placement hours completed within the 2-year period. This must amount to 315 hours or above per student. Section 5 has information about industry placement completion exceptions.</p>

<h3>Manage T Level results service data requirements</h3>

<p>Providers have important responsibilities for inputting industry placement data for each student. Providers must input the industry placement ‘completion’ status on the Manage T Level results service, by <strong>31 July in the students’ second academic year</strong>, for all students that have completed their industry placement within the 2-year programme.</p>

<p>This will trigger the T Level certification process for the full T Level and generates the students’ T Level grade for results day. It is critical that this task is built into the end-to-end process and carried out within the given timeframe.</p>

<p>Providers are responsible for collecting and verifying industry placement data to ensure it is added onto the Manage T Level results service by the deadline. This must involve checking the accuracy and completeness of the placement data before inputting this data onto the Manage T Level Results service. This data can be input onto the system at any point before 31 July, provided the students have met the industry placement completion criteria.</p>

<p>Providers will be expected to inform the awarding organisation of student withdrawals as soon as possible. This is so that the information held on the system can be updated. Providers can then request a statement of achievement within the Manage T Level results service for students who have withdrawn from their course. The statement of achievement will show the T Level components that the student has achieved.</p>

<p>Further detailed guidance on the providers’ role and the steps to be taken, will be made available in due course.</p>

</div>

<h2>Section 5: Industry placement completion exceptions</h2>

<p>Students may experience difficult circumstances during their placement, which mean they are unable to complete the minimum placement hours before the end of the second year.</p>

<p>Providers have the discretion to apply special consideration in some exceptional circumstances where students have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals but have not completed the minimum placement hours. For students who have not completed the minimum placement hours for the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, providers must follow the requirements set out by the Awarding Organisation (NCFE).</p>

<p>Providers also have the discretion to allow students to make up the additional placement hours, up to 2 years after finishing their T Level programme, where they have not been able to demonstrate sufficient progress towards their learning goals and have not completed the minimum placement hours. This aligns with the completion timeframe for other T Level components.</p>

<h3>Special consideration</h3>

<p>There may be exceptional and adverse circumstances where students have met the industry placement completion criteria of demonstrating sufficient progress towards their learning goals and working directly to an external employer, but have not been able to complete the minimum placement hours within the 2-year T Level programme, due to circumstances beyond their control. These exceptional circumstances might include factors within the student’s personal life at the time of the placement, such as a period of long-term sickness or injury, serious mental health issues, or a family bereavement.</p>

<p>The expectation is that in these circumstances, providers will make every effort to ensure that students are able to make up the additional hours so that they are able to complete the required minimum placement hours. However, where this is not possible, providers may be able to use their discretion and sign off placements as complete by applying special consideration, <strong>as long as they are able to evidence that students have met all the other industry placement completion criteria</strong> i.e. they have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals and worked directly to an external employer.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section3">section 3</a>, if students are sick for up to 35 hours over the duration of the placement, this can be absorbed into the placement hours and special consideration does not have to be applied.</p>

<h3>Special consideration criteria</h3>

<p>Providers must familiarise themselves with the industry placement special consideration criteria. This outlines circumstances in which special consideration can be applied and placements marked as completed, and circumstances in which it cannot be applied and, therefore, placements marked as not completed.</p>

<p>Special consideration must not give students an unfair advantage, neither should its use cause prospective employers to be misled regarding students’ achievements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Special consideration criteria</h3>

<p>Providers must familiarise themselves with the industry placement special consideration criteria. This outlines circumstances in which special consideration can be applied and placements marked as completed, and circumstances in which it cannot be applied and, therefore, placements marked as not completed.</p>

<p>Special consideration must not give students an unfair advantage, neither should its use cause prospective employers to be misled regarding students’ achievements.</p>

<p>A student will only be eligible for special consideration to be applied if they have demonstrated sufficient progress towards their learning goals but have not been able to complete the minimum placement hours because they have been affected by exceptional and adverse circumstances beyond their control, or have been sick for more than 35 hours.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>physical or mental illness or accident/injury at the time of the placement
2 .a close family member has a diagnosed serious physical or mental illness at the time of the placement
3 .bereavement of a family member or close friend at the time of the placement</li>
  <li>a significant domestic crisis arising at the time of the placement</li>
  <li>a traumatic incident, or significant change in the student’s circumstances, occurring at the time of the placement
6 .participation in significant sporting events, training camps or other competitions
7 .a safeguarding issue at the workplace where the placement is based has been identified by the provider and the student is unable to make up the hours on another placement</li>
  <li>withdrawal of the placement offer by the employer because they have gone into administration or have encountered severe disruption whereby the workplace is no longer considered a safe place to work, and the provider has exhausted all avenues to identify a suitable alternative placement to enable the student to make up the hours</li>
</ol>

<p>Students <strong>will NOT be eligible for special consideration</strong> if none of the factors above apply and/or if they not been able to complete the minimum placement hours due to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>domestic inconvenience, such as moving house at the time of the placement
2 .making personal arrangements such as a wedding or holiday arrangements which conflict with the placement</li>
  <li>the consequences of committing a crime, where formally charged or found guilty (however, a retrospective application of special consideration can be applied where the charge is later dropped, or the student is found not guilty)</li>
  <li>the consequences of taking alcohol or recreational drugs</li>
  <li>the consequences of disobeying the provider’s and employer’s code of conduct and/or code of practice, including the employer withdrawing the placement offer because of the student’s behaviour or actions</li>
  <li>the bereavement of a family member or close friend, more than 12 months before the placement, unless there are on-going implications such as an inquest or court case at the time of the placement.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4>Special consideration form and supporting evidence</h4>

<p>When providers apply special consideration, they must record it on the Manage T Level results service.</p>

<p>Within the form, providers are asked to declare that they hold documentary evidence to support their decision to apply special consideration. Evidence could include, but is not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notes recorded in a student’s records</li>
  <li>a letter confirming an appointment with social services or other welfare organisation</li>
  <li>a hospital appointment card or dates of hospital admission</li>
  <li>a public record of court proceedings</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers are not required to submit the evidence, but it must be stored for monitoring purposes.</p>

<h4>Recording industry placement special consideration on ILR and school census</h4>

<p>Where providers apply special consideration in extenuating circumstances for any of their students, they must record on the ILR industry placement learning aim that the student has completed 315 hours or 750 hours for the Early Years Educator occupational specialism, even where this may not be the case. This ensures the completion criteria is met for funding purposes.</p>

<h4>Recording industry placement special consideration on ILR and school census</h4>

<p>Providers are expected to input the industry placement ‘completion’ status on the Manage T Level results for all students. Where special consideration has been granted, providers will be prompted to select ‘completed – with special consideration’, type the number of hours completed in the free text box and then select the special consideration criteria that applies.</p>

<p>The department will monitor use of special consideration via the data captured on the Manage T Level results service, to ensure that it is only being applied in exceptional circumstances. If a provider is suspected to be over-using special consideration, this will be investigated.</p>

<h3>Completing or retaking the industry placement after the T Level programme</h3>

<p>All T Level components will be valid for 2 years after the completion of the students’ T Level programme. This is to support students who either need to complete or retake a component of their T Level.</p>

<p>This means that for students that have been unable to complete their industry placement within the 2-year T Level programme, providers have the discretion to allow them an additional 2 years to complete their industry placement, either alongside other T Level components or on its own. This includes for reasons where students have not been able to complete their placement due to exceptional and adverse circumstances beyond their control, such as prolonged sickness, as well as for behavioural issues.</p>

<h4>Completion over the summer period</h4>

<p>If students only have their industry placement component to complete to achieve the full T Level certificate, the expectation is that in the majority of cases, students should be able to complete their placement over the summer, or by <strong>31 October following completion of their T Level programme</strong>. This date is the final cut-off point on the Manage T Level results service for students to be guaranteed a T Level Certificate in November. Student industry placement completions recorded after the 31 October may result in a delay in issuing certificates, meaning that students may not receive a T Level certificate in November.</p>

<p>It will be in the best interests of students to complete their placement as soon as possible. This is because onward progression into employment or further education or training may depend on them having completed the whole T Level programme.</p>

<h4>Longer-term industry placement completion</h4>

<p>In very exceptional circumstances, some students may not be able to return to complete their placement hours straight away - due to mental health issues or recovery from a serious accident, for example - and may require more time to complete their hours. In these situations, providers should consider the best approach, in discussion with the students and their parents/carers. This could include arranging a phased return or doing reduced daily hours.</p>

<h4>Student engagement and behavioural issues</h4>

<p>It is the providers’ responsibility to ensure that the students are clear from the outset of the importance of the industry placement and prepare them adequately for the workplace. However, some students may not be able to complete their industry placement because of persistent behavioural issues that have led to either the provider removing them from the placement or the employer withdrawing the placement. In this scenario, providers should use their professional judgement to decide whether to give the students another opportunity with a different employer. It is for providers to determine whether the students are likely to respond positively to an intensive programme of pre-placement activities and whether they are likely to succeed if given another opportunity.</p>

<h4>Industry placement continuation notification form</h4>

<p>Providers that allow students to continue their placement in the 2 years following completion of their T level programme, must complete the industry placement continuation notification form for each student. The continuation notification form is at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-industry-placements-delivery-guidance">Annex I</a>. This will confirm the ‘pending’ status of the placement and the students’ intention to return over the following 2 years after their programme has finished, to complete their hours. The form must be signed by the students, a member of providers’ senior leadership team and the students’ tutor. Providers must make arrangements with the original employer or an alternative employer, to guarantee that the students have a placement to return to.</p>

<p>It is important for providers to retain the completed continuation notification forms and supporting evidence for monitoring purposes by the department. Providers are also expected to indicate on the Manage T Level results service that the industry placement is yet to be completed.</p>

<p>Guidance on recording ‘continuing’ placements on the ILR/school census and the Manage T Level results service will be provided in due course.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Summary of industry placement exceptions: role and responsibilities</h3>

<h4>Provider responsibilities</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Where special consideration has been applied, providers must adhere to the guidelines including ensuring strict adherence to the special consideration criteria, completing the special consideration form, retaining supporting evidence and uploading the necessary information onto the Manage T Level results service</li>
  <li>Where students continue their placement over the 2 years following their 2-year programme, providers must complete the continuation notification form and ensure it is signed by the students, a member of the senior leadership team and the students’ tutor. Evidence to support this decision must be retained for 3 years. Providers must follow the guidance on Manage T Level results, for inputting an industry placement ‘pending’ status</li>
</ol>
