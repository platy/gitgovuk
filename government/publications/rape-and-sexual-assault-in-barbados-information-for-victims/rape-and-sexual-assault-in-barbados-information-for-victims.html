<h2>Barbados: information for victims of rape and sexual assault</h2>

<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the emergency number on 211</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact your nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate +1 246 430 7800.

They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Any physical and testimonial evidence of the crime reported will be required by the police to assist in the investigation. This includes but is not limited to, the clothing worn during the crime, medical examination, and a detailed account of the offense.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Barbados- what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</li>
  <li>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</li>
  <li>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>

  <li>The local police would inform the British High Commission of the assault.</li>
  <li>The local police would not request a police check on the victim as a common practice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The medical examination – what to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All hospitals and medical centres in Barbados can treat victims of rape and sexual assault.</li>
  <li>If the victim goes to the public hospital, it is within their mandate to report any crime or suspicion of crime.</li>
  <li>A licensed medical practitioner would carry out the examination. Full physical examination, swabbing for DNA and checking for any reported bodily injuries sustained. No photographs will be taken of the body.</li>
  <li>In practice, a female police officer would accompany a female victim throughout their examination unless the victim specifies otherwise. A male victim however can also request the gender of the officer accompanying them.</li>
  <li>The Public Medical Officer on duty is responsible for conducting the medical examination, as such it may be challenging to specify the gender of the medical examiner preferred. This request should still be made to the police if a preference is required.</li>
  <li>The medical examinations do not differ for male and female victims other than the rape kit.</li>
  <li>Once the crime is reported to the police, local tour operators / police will accompany you to the hospital. However, the consular section at the British High Commission can arrange to see you at your earliest convenience with your consent. If you have not sought medical attention and would like to do so we can assist in making arrangements. We can also contact friends and family on your behalf and any organizations that may be able to provide assistance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Hospital medical staff can give advice on HIV PEP medication (‘Post-exposure prophylaxis’, a treatment that can prevent HIV infection). PEP is available locally in emergencies. It is both medically prescribed and closely monitored.</li>
  <li>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</li>
  <li>You can access emergency contraception at any pharmacy, however, a prescription is required and it is expected that you will pay for it.</li>
  <li>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</li>
  <li>Persons seeking private hospital treatment and testing without reporting the crime will have to cover the associated costs.</li>
  <li>If you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Police investigations in Barbados – what to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The police will take the victim to the scene of the crime, however they will not be taken to the suspected location of the assailant to seek their whereabouts for identification. The police will go themselves based on the description of the attacker to attempt to find or arrest said individual.</li>
  <li>The victim will be asked to identify the suspect generally through an ID Parade. The victim’s identity will be protected.</li>
  <li>Once the suspect has been arrested, they will be detained until a date has been set by the court for their hearing. Depending on when/if the victim has to leave before the next court date available, the police and DPPs department would communicate the relevant arrangements for the upcoming hearing and any subsequent hearings to follow.</li>
  <li>The&nbsp;victim will be expected to go before the public prosecutor to make a statement once the matter is being heard in court. The lawyers cannot do this. The lawyers have access to the victim/case notes at this stage, however, all requests for notes are made through the Commissioner of Police.&nbsp;Pro Bono service is generally not offered.</li>
  <li>The victim will be allowed to leave the country once their statement has been made, but it is encouraged to inform the police of your travel plans to ensure all required processes may be completed before departure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Court procedures – what to expect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The victim will be expected to testify in court during the trial. Currently the victim is expected to return to the country to give testimony.&nbsp;This is arranged through the local police and Department for Public Prosecution.</li>
  <li>The victim is entitled to be kept aware of the case. This can be done through the British High Commission or local police. Hiring a lawyer can protect your legal interest within the justice system but it is not necessary for victims.</li>
  <li>Once the statement has been given there is generally no need to give an additional statement.</li>
  <li>The victim may drop charges once filed without the fear of any legal repercussions. Furthermore, there are no legal consequences for dropping charges. The charge of rape is not an automatic state prosecuted charge, the prosecution can also drop the charges depending on the evidence presented.</li>
  <li>The assailant cannot press counter charges.</li>
  <li>The courts cannot order the offender to pay compensation in the criminal court, however, a civil case can be brought before the courts once it has been heard and a guilty conviction was passed in the criminal courts.</li>
