<p><strong>Guidance on the regulations as they apply to toys being supplied in or into Great Britain.</strong></p>

<p>January 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This Guide is for businesses placing toys on the market in Great Britain. If you are placing toys on the market in Northern Ireland, you should read separate guidance.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toys-safety-regulations-2011">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<p>This Guide is designed to help you understand the Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011, as amended by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“the 2011 Regulations”). The 2011 Regulations set out the essential safety requirements that must be met before toys can be placed on the GB market. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure safe products are placed on the market by requiring manufacturers to show how their toys meet the ‘essential safety requirements’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Legislative Background</h2>

<p>The Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011 implemented the requirements of Directive 2009/48/EC, whose purpose is to ensure a high level of toy safety. The EU Withdrawal Act 2018 preserves the 2011 Regulations and enables them to be amended so as to continue to function effectively now that the UK has left the EU. Accordingly, the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-1">see footnote 1</a> fix any deficiencies that arose from the UK leaving the EU (such as references to EU institutions) and make specific provision for the GB market.</p>

<p>There is therefore one set of UK 2011 Regulations, but some of the provisions apply differently in NI for as long as the Northern Ireland Protocol is in force. References to the 2011 Regulations in this guidance are references to those Regulations as they apply in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toys-safety-regulations-2011">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>The 2011 Regulations apply to toys manufactured with the following characteristic: toys designed or intended (whether or not exclusively) for use in play by children under 14 years old. There are some products that are specifically excluded from the scope of the 2011 Regulations (e.g. toy steam engines – see Regulation 4).</p>

<p>Furthermore, Schedule 1 lists the products that are not considered to be toys; the 2011 Regulations do not apply to these listed products.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Requirements</h2>

<p>Regulation 5 outlines the essential safety requirements which apply to toys. 
These are divided into <strong>general safety requirements</strong> and <strong>particular safety requirements</strong>.</p>

<h3>General Safety Requirements</h3>

<p>The general safety requirements are as follows:</p>

<p>Toys, including the chemicals they contain, must not jeopardise the safety or health of users or third parties when they are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the behaviour of children.</p>

<p>The ability of the users and, where appropriate, their supervisors must be taken into account. In particular, this applies to toys intended for use by children under 36 months or by other specified age groups.</p>

<p>Information on hazards and risks involved in using the toy, and the ways of avoiding them, must be marked in English, in a clearly visible, easily legible, understandable and accurate manner. The information must be preceded by the word “Warning” or “Warnings”, and should be marked on the toy, a label affixed to the toy or the toy’s packaging and any accompanying instructions for use.</p>

<h3>Particular Safety Requirements</h3>

<p>There are also particular safety requirements set out in Schedule 2 (which was added to the Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011 by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 but are substantially the same as those that applied previously under Annex II of the Toys Directive). These cover hazards relating to physical/mechanical properties, flammability, chemical properties, electrical properties, hygiene requirements and radioactivity. For example, Schedule 2 sets out a list of allergenic fragrances that toys must not contain.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Obligations of manufacturers</h2>

<p>A manufacturer is a person who manufactures toys, or has toys designed or manufactured, and markets those toys under their name or trademark.</p>

<p>The obligations of manufacturers of toys, which must be complied with before the toy is placed on the GB market, include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Making sure the toy has been designed and manufactured to comply with the essential safety requirements during its foreseeable and normal period of use.</li>
  <li>Carrying out a safety assessment of the toy.</li>
  <li>Following the applicable conformity assessment procedure.</li>
  <li>Drawing up a declaration of conformity and affix the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-2">see footnote 2</a> visibly, legibly and indelibly to the toy, to a label affixed to the toy or to the toy’s packaging. Until 31 December 2023 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-3">see footnote 3</a>, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a document accompanying the toy. Where toys are too small or consist of small parts, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label which is not affixed to the toy or a leaflet which accompanies the toy. Qualifying Northern Ireland goods can be placed on the GB market with the CE and CE UKNI conformity markings, see further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</li>
  <li>Drawing up the technical documentation and keep it and the Declaration of Conformity for 10 years.</li>
  <li>Applying information, identifying the toy (e.g. type/ batch/ serial/ model number) and manufacturer (e.g. name, registered trade name / trademark, contact address) on the toy or, where not possible because of the size or nature of the toy, on its packaging or in an accompanying document.</li>
  <li>Making sure the toy is accompanied by instructions for safe use, safety information and warnings as appropriate. These must be marked in a clearly visible, easily legible, understandable and accurate manner on the toy, a label affixed to the toy or the toy’s packaging and if appropriate on any instructions for use which accompany the toy.</li>
  <li>Making sure that continuing production runs of the same toy remain in conformity.</li>
  <li>Carrying out sample testing of marketed toys.</li>
  <li>Investigating and recording any complaint made in relation to the toy and keeping a register of complaints, non-compliant toys and recalled toys (and keep distributors informed of any of these actions).</li>
  <li>Bringing non-conforming toys into compliance (or if appropriate withdraw or recall the toy) and tell enforcement authorities if there is a safety risk and provide information to those authorities following any requests.</li>
  <li>Identifying the other economic operators in the GB supply chain on request by an enforcement authority where the request is made within 10 years of the toy being supplied.</li>
</ol>

<p>Manufacturers based in Northern Ireland can follow the legislation as it applies to Northern Ireland and place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the GB market without any additional approvals. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Obligations of authorised representatives</h2>

<p>Manufacturers are able by written mandate to appoint authorised representatives to perform certain tasks on their behalf.</p>

<p>Mandated authorised representatives for the GB market can be based in GB or Northern Ireland, but cannot be based outside the UK. A manufacturer can only mandate an authorised representative established in the UK, under the Regulations as they apply in GB.</p>

<p>No GB-based authorised representatives are recognised under EU law. This means GB-based authorised representatives cannot carry out tasks on the manufacturer’s behalf for products being placed on the Northern Ireland or EEA markets. Therefore, a GB manufacturer selling products to the EEA or into Northern Ireland, who wishes to appoint an authorised representative to carry out tasks for them in respect of those products, must appoint an authorised representative based in Northern Ireland or the EEA.</p>

<p>There are certain obligations that the authorised representative’s mandate must include (for example keeping technical documentation) and some that it must not (for example, duty to design and manufacturer in accordance with the essential safety requirements).</p>

<p>An authorised representative must comply with all the duties imposed on the manufacturer under the 2011 Regulations that they are appointed by the manufacturer to perform. A manufacturer remains responsible for the proper performance of any obligations the authorised representative performs on their behalf.</p>

<p>Any references in the 2011 Regulations to the manufacturer are to be taken to include a reference to the authorised representative including in relation to penalties for failure to comply with those duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Obligations of importers</h2>

<p>An importer is a person or business based in the UK who places a toy on the GB market from a country outside the UK. This means that UK businesses which used to act as a ‘distributor’ before the end of the transition period legally become an ‘importer’ if they place products from an EEA country on the GB market.</p>

<p>This includes toys that are supplied to NI businesses from the EEA and then placed on the GB market. In this instance the NI business will take on importer obligations for EEA-supplied goods that are placed on the GB market (see also Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods).</p>

<p>Importers have additional legal obligations which go beyond those of distributors, such as checking that manufacturers have carried out the required conformity assessment procedures, and including their (the importer’s) name, registered trade name or mark and a postal address on the toy or, where this is not possible (because of the size or nature of the toy, or to do so would require opening the packaging), on its packaging or in accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>To assist with the transition, the UK is applying a transitional period ending on 31 December 2022 to allow UK suppliers of goods from the EEA or Switzerland (who from 1 January 2021 are importers into the GB market) to provide their details on the accompanying documentation or packaging as an alternative to placing them on the product itself (where otherwise they would be required to be on the toy). This applies to goods that are not qualifying Northern Ireland goods. For further detail on qualifying Northern Ireland goods, please see Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Can you be contacted easily if there is a problem?</h3>

<p>A key principle underpinning product safety, for the benefit of consumers and regulators, is traceability of a product back to its source.</p>

<p>In recognition that under the new regulatory arrangements you may have the new status of an importer when placing toys from an EEA state or Switzerland on the GB market, you are temporarily permitted when placing such toys on the market (until 31 December 2022) to indicate your name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and a postal address on the toy’s packaging or in a document accompanying the toy, instead of on the toy itself. As set out above, this is usually only permitted where either the size or nature of the toy makes indication on the toy itself impossible or where indication on the toy itself would require the importer to open the toy’s packaging. This additional temporary easement is permitted until 31 December 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-4">See footnote 4</a></p>

<p>We understand that there may be a period of adjustment to the new arrangements for importer documentation for the GB market, and it may be difficult to provide your details on documentation accompanying each and every individual product.</p>

<p>You may therefore use an alternative method where, for example, your contact information is on a document accompanying a batch of products. This document would then follow each batch of products through the distribution chain. Your contact details must follow each product through the distribution chain, but not necessarily by one document per product. Ultimately, the end user, each distributor (and a regulator) must be able to access the information.</p>

<p>Methods which enable traceability of the product after the initial batch has been broken up could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The importer address is present in shipping documents.</li>
  <li>The importer address is present on the invoice to the GB customer.</li>
  <li>The importer address is present on the label that is on the outer packaging (“shipper”) in which a number of finished goods is packed (normally customers will receive shippers unless the order is very small so that the shipper has to be opened and split).</li>
  <li>The importer address is included on the EU Declaration of Conformity and/or UK Declaration of Conformity (whichever is relevant for the product in question).</li>
</ul>

<p>You should work with your distributors to ensure physical documentation does accompany batches of product as far as possible, and in all cases that there are measures in place to ensure end users are able to identify the UK importer.</p>

<p>Alongside that, but not as an alternative, you can use your company website to provide more information, access to product details and contact points for retailers, consumers and enforcement bodies.</p>

<p>These options are for a time limited period only and may not be used after 31 December 2022. You are encouraged to put in place measures to ensure that individual items do carry the importer’s address where required ahead of this date.</p>
</div>

<p>The EU does not have any such transitional provision. In the absence of this, toys being sold from GB to NI or the EU must be labelled with the NI or EU-based importer’s address.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/toys-safety-regulations-2011">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<p>The obligations of importers include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Making sure that the manufacturer has fulfilled their obligations before the importer places a toy on the GB market, including completing a Declaration of Conformity and relevant technical documentation, and affixing the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-5">see footnote 5</a> visibly, legibly and indelibly to the toy. Until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a document accompanying the toy (in addition to other permissible places where the UKCA marking may be affixed – see above).</li>
  <li>Making sure that the importer’s name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and a postal address is marked on the toy or where this is not possible because of the size or nature of the toy, or where the importer has imported the toy from an EEA state or Switzerland and places it on the GB market before 31 December 2022, or where the importer would have to open the toy’s packaging to mark these details on the toy, in a document accompanying the toy or on its packaging, as well as the manufacturer’s details.</li>
  <li>Making sure that the compliance of the toy is not affected by the conditions of storage or transport.</li>
  <li>Carrying out sample testing of marketed toys.</li>
  <li>Investigating and recording any complaint made in relation to the toy and keeping a register of complaints, non-compliant toys and recalled toys and keep distributors informed of any action taken.</li>
  <li>Bringing non-conforming toys into compliance (or if appropriate withdraw or recall the toy) and inform the authorities and other economic operators if there is a safety risk.</li>
  <li>Keeping a copy of the Declaration of Conformity and make sure the technical documentation is available to enforcement authorities on request, both for a period of 10 years.</li>
  <li>Identifying the other economic operators in the GB supply chain.</li>
</ol>

<p>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods complying with the legislation as it applies in Northern Ireland, including affixing the CE marking, may also be placed on the GB market. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Obligations of distributors</h2>

<p>UK businesses which were distributors of toys within the EU single market should now consider whether they are importers from the EU single market and therefore what additional requirements they need to comply with – see section 7 above. A distributor is any person, other than the manufacturer or importer, who makes toys available on the market.</p>

<p>The obligations of distributors include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Taking due care to ensure that toys they make available on the GB market are compliant with the Regulations (and not make toys available if they believe the toy will not comply with the essential safety requirements during its foreseeable and normal use).</li>
  <li>Verifying that the manufacturer has applied information identifying the toy and manufacturer, applied the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-6">see footnote 6</a> and that the toy is accompanied by instructions for safe use and safety information where appropriate. Until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a document accompanying, the toy.</li>
  <li>Verifying that the importer has applied their name and address on the toy, its packaging or on a document accompanying the toy.</li>
  <li>Making sure that the compliance of the toy is not affected by the conditions of storage or transport.</li>
  <li>Bringing non-conforming toys into compliance (or if appropriate withdraw or recall the toy) and inform the authorities and other economic operators if there is a safety risk.</li>
  <li>Identifying the other economic operators in the GB supply chain.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Transitional arrangements</h2>

<h3>Products placed on the market before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you placed an individual fully manufactured product on the EEA or the UK market (either in Northern Ireland or Great Britain) before 1 January 2021, you do not need to do anything new. These individual goods can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user and do not need to comply with the changes that took effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A fully manufactured good is ‘placed on the market’ when there is a written or verbal agreement (or offer of an agreement) to transfer ownership or possession or other rights in the product. This does not require physical transfer of the good.</p>

<p>You can usually provide proof of placing on the market on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contracts of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured and meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>documents concerning the shipping of goods for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) bears the burden of proof for demonstrating that the good was placed on the EEA or UK market before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Existing CE marked stock</h3>

<p>The UK will allow CE marked toys that have been either self-declared as compliant (where permissible) or where compliance must and has been demonstrated through assessment by an EU-recognised conformity assessment body (notified body) to be placed on the GB market until 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>Toys lawfully placed on the market with a CE marking by 31 December 2022 can continue to circulate on the GB market after this date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> UKCA Marking</h2>

<h3>Assessment through third-party organisations:</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, toys that are conformity assessed by a UK approved body should be UKCA marked, not CE marked. If the conformity assessment was carried out by a UK conformity assessment body and the CE marking was affixed to the fully made product before 1 January 2021, the CE marking can still be used, but the toy must be placed on the GB market before 31 December 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-7">See footnote 7</a></p>

<p>Where the toy has been assessed by an EU notified body, manufacturers must continue to use the CE marking for toys being placed on the GB market instead of the new UKCA marking. The toy can then be placed on the GB market until 31 December 2022. Qualifying Northern Ireland goods complying with the legislation as it applies in Northern Ireland, including affixing the CE marking, may be placed on the GB market after 31 December 2022. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<p>Rules around physically affixing the new UKCA marking mirror those which currently apply for the application of the CE marking, including affixing it on a label affixed to the toy or its packaging and where not possible to affix it directly on the toy because of the size or nature of the toy on a label which is not affixed to the toy or on a leaflet which accompanies the toy. Irrespective of the latter provisions, until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a document accompanying the toy, rather than being affixed to the toy itself, its packaging or a label affixed to the toy.</p>

<h3>Self-declaration</h3>

<p>Manufacturers placing toys on the GB market on the basis of self-declaration of conformity (where allowed in the Regulations) can affix the UKCA marking before placing a product on the GB market. Alternatively, until 31 December 2022, manufacturers can affix the CE marking based on self-declaration of conformity by the manufacturer (where allowed in the Regulations), before placing toys on the GB market.</p>

<p>It is possible to affix both the UKCA marking and the CE marking to the same product where conformity assessment is based on self-declaration (where allowed in the Regulations), where the EU and GB requirements remain the same or the product conforms to the requirements of both. When selling to the EU, or placing on the NI market, the CE marking remains mandatory.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods</h2>

<p>The government committed to providing unfettered access for qualifying Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK market after 1 January 2021. Products that can be placed on the market in Northern Ireland in accordance with the legislation, as it applies to Northern Ireland, can be sold in the rest of the UK without any additional approvals.</p>

<p>This means that products that are qualifying Northern Ireland goods can be sold in the rest of the UK if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the CE marking is lawfully applied to the good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an EU-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the EU has a relevant mutual recognition agreement) and a CE marking is affixed</li>
  <li>the certificate of conformity previously held by a UK approved body has been transferred to an EU-recognised notified body and a CE marking has been affixed</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by a UK-based body, and the good is therefore marked with the CE marking and with the new UKNI marking.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be the case even if there are changes between the EU rules that the Northern Ireland Protocol applies to NI and the GB rules.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a></p>

<p>NI businesses that are importing products from the EEA and placing them on the GB market must ensure that the relevant conformity assessment procedure has been carried out, that the technical documentation has been drawn up and that the toy bears the CE marking. They will also have to comply with the importer labelling duties (see Section 7 on obligations of importers).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Approved Bodies</h2>

<p>The UK has established a new framework for UK based bodies to assess products against GB rules. Existing UK notified bodies have been granted new UK ‘approved body’ status and are listed on a new UK database.</p>

<p>Approved bodies are conformity assessment bodies which have been approved by the Secretary of State to carry out the procedures for conformity assessment and certification for the GB market as set out in the 2011 Regulations.</p>

<p>These approved bodies retain their 4-digit identification number. New approved bodies will be assigned a number by the Office for Product Safety and Standards on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Approved bodies can assess products for the GB market against UK essential safety requirements (which are, as yet, the same as EU essential safety requirements).</p>

<p>Approved bodies must be established in the UK and be independent of the manufacturer. Approved bodies must examine the technical documentation and supporting evidence in respect of a toy to assess the adequacy of the technical design.</p>

<p>Where an approved body finds that essential safety requirements have not been met by a manufacturer, they must not issue a certificate of conformity and they must require the manufacturer to take corrective measures.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-market-conformity-assessment-bodies">View the register of UK Approved Bodies</a></p>

<p>The register also contains details of bodies in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and the United States of America, which the UK is designating as Approved Bodies through Mutual Recognition Agreements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Enforcement</h2>

<p>In Great Britain, local trading standards authorities have a duty to enforce the 2011 Regulations. The Secretary of State is also an enforcement authority across the UK.</p>

<p>Enforcement action may be taken in cases of non-compliance such as inappropriate conformity marking or in cases where the enforcement authority has reason to believe that the toy presents a risk to the safety and health of persons.</p>

<p>The enforcement authority may issue a compliance notice in the case of certain types of non-compliance and take action where this notice is not complied with. Where an enforcement authority has sufficient reason to believe that a toy presents a risk to the health and safety of persons, the operator may be required to withdraw the toys from the GB market or undertake a recall.</p>

<p>Enforcement authorities must take all appropriate measures in relation to toys which pose a serious risk to consumers and may require an economic operator to withdraw them from the GB market, to prohibit or restrict their supply.</p>

<h3>Regulators’ Code</h3>

<p>Enforcement authorities must continue to have regard to the Regulators’ Code when developing the policies and operational procedures that guide their regulatory activities in this area. They should carry out their activities in a way that supports those they regulate to comply and grow, including choosing proportionate approaches that reflect risk.</p>

<p>In responding to non-compliance that they identify, regulators should clearly explain what the non-compliant item or activity is, the advice being given, actions required, or decisions taken, and the reasons for these. Unless immediate action is needed to prevent a serious breach, regulators should provide an opportunity for dialogue in relation to the advice, requirements or decisions, with a view to ensuring that they are acting in a way that is proportionate and consistent. The Secretary of State takes account of the provisions of both the Regulators’ Code and the Growth Duty in exercising their regulatory functions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Read the Regulators’ Code</a></p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>Offences may result in unlimited fines (England and Wales), or of up to £10,000 (Scotland), or a maximum prison term of 6 months, or both.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Charities and toy sales, second-hand toys</h2>

<p>The responsibilities in the Regulations apply when a person is “acting in the course of a commercial activity (whether in return for payment or free of charge)”. Many charities are subject to the Regulations because they operate trading companies or bodies that are similar to businesses that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>money generating</li>
  <li>have a degree of continuity</li>
  <li>keep regular business hours</li>
</ul>

<p>People organising events such as jumble sales and car boot sales – that are held at infrequent and irregular intervals – are unlikely to be considered as acting in the course of business. However, traders invited to sell toys there would not be exempt from the requirements of the regulations.</p>

<p>In the context of on-line sales, a parent selling used toys through infrequent social media posts is unlikely to be considered as acting in the course of a business. However, a regular seller of items in an on-line marketplace would not be exempt from the requirements of the regulations, since that is likely to be considered “in the course of a commercial activity”. Individuals producing toys on an occasional basis to give to charities to sell are also likely to be exempt.</p>

<span class="number">15. </span> Glossary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Approved Body</strong> – A conformity assessment body which has been approved by the Secretary of State or was previously a ‘notified body’ before 1 January 2021.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Authorised Representative</strong> – A person appointed in writing by a manufacturer to perform specific tasks for the manufacturer. From 1 January 2021, authorised representatives for the GB market must be based in the UK. Manufacturers remain ultimately responsible for ensuring these tasks are carried out properly.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Declaration of conformity</strong> – A document prepared by the manufacturer which must include (amongst other things) the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the specific toy to which the declaration is referring</li>
      <li>the name and address of the manufacturer and, where applicable, their authorised representative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This must be kept by the manufacturer and importer for a period of ten years from the date on which the toy was placed on the GB market. This declaration must be made available to the enforcing authority upon request.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Distributor</strong> – Any person in the GB supply chain, other than the manufacturer or the importer, who makes a toy available on the GB market.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Enforcement Authority</strong> – In Great Britain, for toys for consumer use this is local trading standards authorities. The Secretary of State is also an enforcement authority across the UK.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Importer</strong> – A person established in the UK who places a toy from a country outside of the UK on the GB market. A person who before 1 January 2021 (under EU Rules) distributed toys within the EU (including the UK) will now be an importer if they are bringing a toy into GB from another country (including EU Member States). This includes a person based in NI who has been supplied with the product from an EEA country, who would, under NI law, be a distributor.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Manufacturer</strong> – A person who manufactures a toy or has a toy designed or manufactured and markets that toy under their name or trademark.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKCA Marking</strong> – The UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is the new UK conformity marking used for certain goods (including toys) being placed on the GB market, in place of the CE marking which is the conformity marking used in Northern Ireland and the European Union.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKNI Marking</strong> (also known as the UK(NI) indication) – The UKNI marking is a new marking applied in addition to the CE marking, where a good requiring mandatory third-party conformity assessment has been tested against EU requirements by a UK body. The UKNI marking applies when placing such products on the Northern Ireland market. Under the Government’s unfettered access commitments, products lawfully marked with the UKNI marking can also be placed on the GB market if they are also qualifying Northern Ireland goods.</li>
</ul>
