<h2>What is known about the reports of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination</h2>

<p>Guillain-Barré Syndrome (<abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr>) is a rare condition where the body’s immune system damages nerve cells and typically presents with sensory abnormalities, muscle weakness and autonomic dysfunction, often triggered by infection, although the cause is not always identified. It usually develops over hours or days, starting in the extremities (hands and feet) before spreading to the arms and legs, typically affecting both sides. Initial symptoms include numbness, pins and needles, muscle weakness, pain, and balance and coordination problems. Severity can range from mild, transient weakness to complete paralysis. It is generally a single episode in a patient’s life.</p>

<p>The incidence in the UK population is estimated at 2 per 100,000 per year and increases with age and is more common in men, with similar numbers is other western countries. In the USA, the incidence is similar and between 3,000 and 6,000 people develop <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> each year.</p>

<p>Since all adults in the UK have been offered a coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>) vaccine, a certain number of cases of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> would be expected to occur co-incidentally following vaccination. Cases following <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination have been reported in the UK and internationally and investigations are ongoing to establish if the rate of reported cases is above what would be expected in the population and whether there is evidence of an association with these vaccines. <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> cases have been reported following other vaccination programmes, with research particularly focusing on <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> and the seasonal flu vaccine. These studies have shown variable results and where an increase has been observed, it has been in the range of 1 to 2 additional <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> cases per million flu vaccine doses administered. However, importantly the evidence suggests that an individual is more likely to get <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> after having flu infection compared with after the vaccination.</p>

<h2>UK reports</h2>

<p>As of 8 December 2021, in the UK there have been 472 reports of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following AstraZeneca (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>) vaccination and 27 reports of Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> which causes abnormal muscle coordination, paralysis of eye muscles and loss of tendon reflexes. There have been 69 reports of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> and 2 of Miller Fisher syndrome following Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and 7 reports of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following Moderna vaccination. Over this time period, 24.9 million first doses and 24.1 million second doses of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine have been administered, 24.8 million first doses and 21.2 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been administered, and 1.5 million first doses and 1.4 million second doses of the Moderna vaccine.</p>

<p>The observed number of cases in the UK based on cases reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) by the <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> yellow card scheme, have been compared with the number of expected <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> cases in the immunised population. The number of cases reported following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines are lower than the number expected to occur by chance. For the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> has very rarely been reported within 6 weeks of the first dose, with the risk approximately 5.6 extra cases of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> per million doses. Rates after the second dose are within background levels and there is no evidence of a higher rate of reporting in individuals who have had <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> previously. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">Green Book</a> for further information. Following a review of the most recent data for the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine and advice from the Commission on Human Medicines and its <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group, the product information for the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine has been updated to include <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> in the adverse reactions associated with the vaccine. Health professionals and the public are encouraged to look out for the signs and symptoms of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to review the vaccination data; however, it is important to note that the assessment from the Expert Working group is that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh these rare side-effects.</p>

<h2>International reports</h2>

<p>In the <a rel="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-july-13-2021" class="govuk-link">US</a>, as of 13 July 2021 there were 100 preliminary reports of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) vaccine and 1 death with 12.5 million vaccine doses administered. Information on <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> has now been included on the vaccine recipient and vaccination provider factsheets. The Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) vaccine has been approved for use in the UK but has not been deployed in the UK vaccination programme. No signal in the US has been identified with either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. In Europe, the European Medicine Agency recommended the addition of a warning to raise awareness of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following vaccination with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, with 227 <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> cases reported by 27 June 2021 and 51.4 million doses given by 20 June 2021. A similar recommendation has been made for the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) vaccine.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-07-2021-statement-of-the-who-gacvs-covid-19-subcommittee-on-gbs" rel="external">World Health Organization</a> has also reviewed the data, noting that increased reports have not been observed following mRNA <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), but that the potential benefits of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) and <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccines continue to outweigh any potential risk of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Have cases been reported after the 1st or 2nd dose of <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine or any specific vaccine?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> are analysing all reports of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination and this information will be shared when it becomes available. A causal link between <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination and <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> has not been proven for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and cases of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> that occur following vaccination may occur by chance, with a background rate of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> of 2 per 100,000 per year. For the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> has very rarely been reported within 6 weeks of the first dose, with the risk approximately 5.6 extra cases of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> per million doses. Rates after the second dose are within background levels and there is no evidence of a higher rate of reporting in individuals who have had <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> previously. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a" class="govuk-link">Green Book</a> for further information.</p>

<p>For the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) vaccine which has a 1 dose schedule, data from the US indicates that there is an increased risk of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> in the 42 days following this single dose, and investigations are ongoing to assess whether there is a causal relationship between the vaccine and the cases of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Reporting a suspected case of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination</h2>

<p>It is very important that all suspected cases are reported to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> Yellow Card scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>Should someone who has had <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> unrelated to <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination have their <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination?</h2>

<p>Yes, they should be vaccinated as recommended for their age and risk group, including booster doses.</p>

<p>A causal link between <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination and <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> has not been proven and there is no evidence of a higher rate of reporting of <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> following <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination in individuals who have previously had <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr>. Hence, the balance of risk benefit is in favour of completing the recommended <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination schedule. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a">Green Book</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>If someone has had <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> after a <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination, should they have subsequent doses?</h2>

<p>If <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> develops in an individual after a dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, they should complete the vaccination schedule with the same vaccine once fully recovered. The balance of risk benefit remains in favour of completing a full <abbr title="coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine schedule and there is an increased rate of known side-effects if mixed schedules are used. If the next dose is a booster dose, then the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is recommended.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Guillain-Barré Syndrome">GBS</abbr> develops within 6 weeks of receiving the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine, then on a precautionary basis Pfizer/BioNTech should be given for any subsequent doses. Please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-the-green-book-chapter-14a" class="govuk-link">Green Book</a> for further information.</p>
