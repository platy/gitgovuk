<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: important changes to the Education and Skills Agency (ESFA) and the Department for Education (DfE) from 1 April 2022</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-education-and-skills-funding-agency">final summary report of the ESFA review</a> has been published this week, alongside DfE’s response to the report’s recommendations and the changes being implemented to the way the ESFA and DfE will operate from 1 April.</p>

<p>Over the past 6 months many of our partners have helped feed into and shape the Arm’s Length Body review of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), led by Sir David Bell. We would like to thank all those that took the time to contribute to the review.</p>

<p>The ALB review was timely as, like many organisations, ESFA and DfE have been reflecting on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, this includes how we and our sectors operate and how we want to work in future. The changes being implemented from 01 April are built on the positive things we have learnt from the pandemic so both the DfE and ESFA can better serve their customers, and support children and learners to realise their potential.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: apprenticeship and traineeship employers demonstrating high-risk behaviours</h2>

<p>We have published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/policy-for-apprenticeship-and-traineeship-employers-demonstrating-high-risk-behaviours/policy-for-apprenticeship-and-traineeship-employers-demonstrating-high-risk-behaviours">policy for apprenticeship and traineeship employers demonstrating high risk behaviours</a> to ensure that every apprentice/trainee has an opportunity to develop their career with an employer that is committed to them.</p>

<p>Whilst most apprenticeship and traineeship employers work in accordance with the Agreements and Funding Rules, ESFA recognises that some use public funds for purposes other than those intended. ESFA has a responsibility to protect public funding, so it is important that action is taken when such situations arise.</p>

<p>This policy mirrors the “Funding Higher Risk Organisations and Subcontractors” policy and provides clarity to employers on the circumstances under which the ESFA would consider them high-risk in line with existing Agreements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: volunteers needed to participate in user research about ESFA notifications</h2>

<p>We are looking for volunteers to participate in a user research panel to help us understand and develop our notifications to users.</p>

<p>We would like to hear from schools, academies, children’s centres, local authorities, colleges, and trusts, who can tell us about their experience of receiving information about grants, specifically, finding out about new grants, knowing what supporting evidence is required and when, understanding whether your application has been processed and when you should expect to receive payment.</p>

<p>If you would like to take part, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yXfS-grGoU2187O4s0qC-R0j6hhXvc5GvwU99Fe4qEFUNURFTDY2WTg2TkVCSVlJOVhKOTcwRUYxMi4u" rel="external">complete our online form</a> and we will be in touch.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: ESFA adult education budget (AEB) funding and performance management rules 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>We have published version 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2021-to-2022">AEB funding rules</a>. The main changes are:</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: cyber security update</h2>

<p>As a result of current heightened tensions in the Ukraine, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-organisations-encouraged-to-take-action-around-ukraine-situation" rel="external">advising all organisations</a> to take action to strengthen their cyber security resilience.</p>

<p>NCSC published guidance includes the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patching systems</li>
  <li>improving access controls and enabling multi-factor authentication</li>
  <li>implementing an effective incident response plan</li>
  <li>checking that backup and restore mechanisms are working</li>
  <li>ensuring that online defences are working as expected</li>
  <li>keeping up to date with the latest threat and mitigation information</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations are strongly urged to read:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Information: employer identifiers and ILR submissions</h2>

<p>From 1 April 2022, the way you look up Employer identifiers to input on the individualised learner record (ILR) Learner Employment Status and Learning Delivery Work Placement entities will change.</p>

<p>A new Employer Data Service (EDS) search facility will be made available on the submit learner data service to enable providers to search for Employer identifiers. The current Employer Data Service (EDS) will be decommissioned.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2022 you will no longer have to request new Employer identifiers. Where the required employer cannot be found, a value of 999999999 should be used, but it will no longer be necessary to update the submitted 999999999 value within 60 days.</p>

<p>For academic year 2022 to 2023, the requirements for providing the Employer identifier on the ILR will change and by academic year 2023 to 2024 the use of the Employer identifier on the ILR will be completely removed. Further updates will be provided regarding these changes.</p>

<p>The ILR specification and provider support manual will be updated accordingly for the April 2022.</p>

<p>We are making these changes as the need for information on employers on the ILR has been reducing over the last few years with the arrival of the apprenticeship service and changes to funding rules. The programmes that used this data either no longer require it (such as apprenticeships) or are coming to an end over the next 2 years (such as ESF). To this end we are going to simplify the data that is being returned in the short term, from 1 April 2022, with the plan to fully remove from the ILR by academic year 2023 to 2024.</p>

<p>Further information will be shared in ESFA Update.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Information: launch of Flexi-Job Apprenticeship Agencies</h2>

<p>We have launched the new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flexi-job-apprenticeship-offer">Register of Flexi-Job Apprenticeship Agencies</a>. Flexi-Job Apprenticeship agencies will enable employers in sectors with project-based employment models, such as creative, construction and digital, to make much greater use of apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Employers that have been successful in joining the Register of Flexi-Job Apprenticeship Agencies understand their sector and region well and have identified barriers that have so far prevented employers from engaging successfully in apprenticeships, they are committed to delivering high-quality apprenticeship training, and are ready to support the growth of apprenticeships using these new flexibilities.</p>
