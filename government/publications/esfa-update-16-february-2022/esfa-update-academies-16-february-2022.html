<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: important changes to the Education and Skills Agency (ESFA) and the Department for Education (DfE) from 1 April 2022</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-education-and-skills-funding-agency">final summary report of the ESFA review</a> has been published this week, alongside DfE’s response to the report’s recommendations and the changes being implemented to the way the ESFA and DfE will operate from 1 April.</p>

<p>Over the past 6 months many of our partners have helped feed into and shape the Arm’s Length Body review of the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), led by Sir David Bell. We would like to thank all those that took the time to contribute to the review.</p>

<p>The ALB review was timely as, like many organisations, ESFA and DfE have been reflecting on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, this includes how we and our sectors operate and how we want to work in future. The changes being implemented from 01 April are built on the positive things we have learnt from the pandemic so both the DfE and ESFA can better serve their customers, and support children and learners to realise their potential.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: academy general allocation guides for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We’ve published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023">academy general allocation guides for the 2022 to 2023 academic year</a> for mainstream academies, free schools, UTC’s and studio schools, special and alternative provision academies and special free schools. This guidance is for academies that were open before 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>During February we will also publish the guidance for academies open between 1 April and 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>We’ll begin issuing 2022 to 2023 general annual grant allocation statements towards the end of February 2022. We expect to issue all allocation statements to academies that opened before or on 1 January 2022 by the end of March 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: update to high needs operational guidance for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance">high needs funding: 2022 to 2023 operational guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The main changes to the guidance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information on the dedicated schools grant supplementary funding which we announced in December 2021</li>
  <li>further supporting information about the teachers’ pay and pension funding</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance provides a summary of key dates and actions for local authorities and educational providers, including how the 2022 to 2023 financial and academic year high needs funding system should operate for all types of educational provision. As this guidance is applicable to institutions now, it should be considered with immediate effect.</p>

<p>The department has launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/school-admissions-team/changes-to-the-school-admission-appeals-code" rel="external">consultation on a revised version of the school admission appeals code</a>. The consultation is open until 3 April 2022.</p>

<p>The permanent changes we are consulting on are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>to allow appeal hearings to continue and be decided by a panel of two, if the third member of an appeal panel has to withdraw and either postponing the remaining hearings or restarting the appeal will lead to an unreasonable delay</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read further details and background information on the proposed changes and the rationale behind the proposals in the consultation document available alongside the consultation.</p>
