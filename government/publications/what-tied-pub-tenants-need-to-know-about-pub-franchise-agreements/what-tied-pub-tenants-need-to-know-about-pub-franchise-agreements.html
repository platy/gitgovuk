<p>This factsheet is for tied pub tenants who want to know about pub franchise agreements and their rights under the Code if they have such an agreement.</p>

<p>It provides information to support tenant understanding. It is not a substitute for the Pubs Code legal framework.</p>

<p>If you are a tied pub tenant with a pub franchise agreement you have many Code rights, but you do not have the right to use the Market Rent Only (MRO) process.</p>

<p>A tied pub agreement is a pub franchise agreement if it meets all the requirements in regulation 55 of the Code. This includes (but is not limited to) that you take a percentage of the pub’s turnover, you do not pay rent and you have the right to use the pub-owning business’ relevant business model.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>How are pub franchise agreements covered by the Code?</h2>

<p><strong>See Pubs Code – Regulation 55</strong></p>

<p>If you have a pub franchise agreement you have most rights under the Code that apply to a tied pub tenant (TPT). Certain rights do not apply or apply differently. This factsheet explains these differences.</p>

<p>Your pub-owning business (POB) should tell you if your pub franchise agreement is covered by the Code. If you are unsure about this you can speak with your POB’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-compliance-officer-information/code-compliance-officer-cco-contact-details">Code Compliance Officer</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What Code rights do not apply to me if I have a pub franchise agreement?</h2>

<p>•	The right to serve a Market Rent Only (MRO) notice, requesting a MRO option.</p>

<p>•	The restriction on a POB requiring a TPT to purchase or rent gaming machines.</p>

<p>•	The right to a Rent Proposal (usually before the start of the tenancy or renewal under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954). Under a pub franchise agreement, you do not pay rent.</p>

<p>•	The right to a Rent Assessment Proposal (at rent review or when the TPT has the right to request one)</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What are my Code rights if I have a pub franchise agreement?</h2>

<p>Apart from the above rights that do not apply, you have most of the same Code rights as a TPT who does not have a pub franchise agreement. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pubs-code-factsheets">PCA’s other factsheets for information</a> about them.</p>

<p>These rights include the following:</p>

<p><strong>Information rights, and rights as a new franchisee before entering into an agreement</strong></p>

<p>The POB must provide certain information to you if you are considering entering into a new pub franchise agreement.</p>

<p>It must also ensure that you complete a sustainable business plan and advise you to seek your own professional advice and complete pubs entry training. This is so you can make an informed decision about the business and whether it is right for you.</p>

<p>More detailed information about the information a POB must provide all new tenants, including franchisees, in respect of new agreements can be found in the PCA’s factsheet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-tied-pub-tenants-need-to-know-about-the-duties-of-a-pub-owning-business-in-connection-to-new-tied-agreements">What Tied Pub Tenants Need to Know about the Duties of a Pub-Owning Business in Connection to New Tied Agreements</a>.</p>

<p>The POB’s duties are the same for all tenants, including franchisees, subject to certain differences for franchisees. Before entering into a franchise agreement, you must <strong>also</strong> receive information including:</p>

<p>•	Information about any fees you have to pay to the POB</p>

<p>•	Details of the share of turnover you are entitled to receive</p>

<p>•	Evidence that the agreement is a pub franchise agreement</p>

<p>•	A forecast profit and loss statement for the first 12 months of the pub franchise agreement</p>

<p>The POB is <strong>not</strong> required to give you the current price list for products or services supplied under the agreement or information on any discounts that may be available in connection with the purchase of these.</p>

<p><strong>Conduct of Business Development Managers</strong></p>

<p><strong>See Pubs Code – Regulation 41</strong></p>

<p>A Business Development Manager (BDM) is someone who a POB employs as such, as well as anyone else who represents the POB in negotiations with you in connection with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>repairs to the tied pub premises; or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>matters relating to your current or future business plans</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The POB must:</p>

<p>•	provide you with information about the BDM’s role and the support and guidance they will give you</p>

<p>and ensure the BDM:</p>

<p>•	deals with you in a fair and lawful manner</p>

<p>•	takes appropriate notes of discussions with you in connection with repairs to the premises or matters relating to your current or future business plans.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The BDM must provide you with a <strong>record of the discussion</strong> within <strong>14 days</strong> (from the day of the discussion).</p>

<p>They must ask you to respond to them if you disagree with any aspect of the record within <strong>7 Days</strong> (from the day you receive the record).</p>
</div>

<p>More detailed information about the duties of POBs in relation to BDMs can be found in the PCA’s factsheet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-tied-pub-tenants-need-to-know-about-business-development-managers-and-code-compliance-officers">What Tied Pub Tenants Need to Know about Business Development Managers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Condition of the premises</strong></p>

<p><strong>See Pubs Code – Regulation 13</strong></p>

<p>Before entering into a pub franchise agreement, the POB must advise you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>conduct a thorough inspection of the premises; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>get the advice of a qualified surveyor with professional experience relating to tied pubs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A Schedule of Condition specifies the condition of the premises. This may then be used or updated in various circumstances before and during the agreement.</p>

<p>If, before entering into a new agreement, you or the POB agree to carry out any maintenance, repair or improvements works to the pub, the POB must make sure the Schedule of Condition is updated to reflect that the works have been done.</p>

<p><strong>Rights not to suffer detriment</strong></p>

<p><strong>See Pubs Code – Regulations 50 and 51</strong></p>

<p>The POB must not subject you to any detriment because you attempt to exercise any right under the Code.</p>

<p>The POB must not subject you to any detriment, or impose any liability on you, as a result of any reading taken from a flow monitoring device without additional evidence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What is a pub franchise agreement under the Code?</h2>

<p>For your arrangement with the POB to be a pub franchise agreement under the Code, it must fulfil <strong>all</strong> the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You take a percentage of turnover</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The percentage of turnover must either be:</p>

<p>• a percentage of the pub turnover specified in the agreement; or
• where the tied pub’s turnover increases beyond a threshold in the agreement, the 
percentage increased by a specified amount.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The POB is required to offer you marketing, training and other business support</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have the right to use the POB’s relevant business model</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The relevant business model must:</p>

<p>• be a model for doing business at a pub which the POB has used for at least two pubs for 12 months or more; and</p>

<p>• include the use of the POB’s intellectual property rights and methods, procedures and other technical and industrial know-how required for its use.</p>

<p>The POB must be able to demonstrate that the model has the potential to succeed when 
applied to the tied pub</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You are not required to pay the POB any amount for occupying the tied pub (except for the remaining percentage of turnover)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are not required to make payments to the POB for the supply of products or services for the tied pub</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You may agree to pay the POB for additional tied products/services after the franchise 
agreement has been entered into as long as:</p>

<p>• they are at cost price,</p>

<p>• these are not products/services that the POB has agreed to supply under the franchise 
agreement; and</p>

<p>• the franchise agreement does not require you to purchase them.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>You have the right to sell the business to another person at market value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a tied pub agreement does not meet <strong>all</strong> these criteria, it will not be a pub franchise agreement.</p>

<p>If you have any queries or concerns about the status of your pub agreement or your 
Code rights, you may contact your POB’s <strong>Code Compliance Officer (CCO).</strong></p>

<p>To find out more about the role of the CCO and for their contact details, please see our
