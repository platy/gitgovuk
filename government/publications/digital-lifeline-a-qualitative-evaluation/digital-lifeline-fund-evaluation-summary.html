<span class="number">1. </span> Ministerial Foreword from Rt Hon Nadine Dorries MP, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145515/Nadine_Dorries.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Technology is now an integral part of everyday life — a fact that was made even starker when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the world online during lockdown. So it’s incredibly important that everyone in the UK has the digital skills and access to reap the benefits of being online and to participate fully in society. We want to ensure no one is left behind by the digital revolution, no matter what challenges they face.</p>

<p>In February 2021 we launched a £2.5 million Digital Lifeline Fund to reduce the digital exclusion of people with learning disabilities. The fund provided free devices, data and digital support to over 5000 people with learning disabilities who can’t afford to get online. The aim of the programme was to use digital inclusion to reduce the disproportionate negative effects of COVID-19 on people with learning disabilities, such as loneliness and lack of contact with support networks.</p>

<p>As this report shows, the fund has already had a hugely positive impact. Overall, 5,500 people have been given a tablet, as well as ongoing support to provide them with the basic skills and confidence to use it. Months later, our survey showed that most people were still using their tablet regularly to connect with friends and family, pursue hobbies and interests, keep themselves active and learn. Over half were using it once a day. Moreover, 91 % of recipients experienced at least one benefit from the Digital Lifeline after 4 weeks, including feeling more confident, more connected, less lonely and that their digital skills had improved.</p>

<p>These results are testament to the value of offering support alongside the provision of devices, empowering individuals to be digitally active. I am proud of Digital Lifeline’s achievements, and thank Good Things Foundation for their support and delivery to make this such a successful project, which has made huge progress against my personal goal of ensuring that everyone in the UK has access to the benefits of the digital age.<br><br><br></p>

<p>Rt Hon Nadine Dorries MP<br> 
<strong>Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Foreword from Helen Milner, OBE, Chief Executive, Good Things Foundation</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145527/Helen-Milner-headshot-2__2_.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Digital Lifeline has been an overwhelming success and a true collaborative partnership programme. Together with our national and community partners we’ve exceeded our goal by far.  The speed at which the programme was delivered was exceptional, reaching 5,500 digitally excluded people with learning disabilities in just a few months.</p>

<p>Nine in ten people supported say their lives have already got better, whether through helping them connect with loved ones, or friendship and support groups, or growing their confidence when online.</p>

<p>Thank you to our 146 community partners. Thank you to our national partners: AbilityNet, Learning Disability England, VODG: Voluntary Organisations Disability Group, and Digital Unite. And thank you to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport for funding this life-changing initiative.</p>

<p>The pandemic exposed a deep digital divide. Digital Lifeline shows the benefits, but too many people with learning disabilities and disabled people are still left behind. It is time to fix the digital divide.<br><br><br></p>

<span class="number">6. </span> The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for Digital Lifeline</h2>

<p>People with learning disabilities are more likely to face barriers to getting online than people without learning disabilities.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>During the pandemic, many health services were only available online, and whilst some people with learning disabilities were able to use technology to access these services, many were unable to do so due to barriers such as lack of digital skills, a lack of in-home support and lack of access to technology or the internet (Source: Cebr 2021; Sense 2021; Seale 2020). This had serious consequences for their physical and mental health (Source: Office for National Statistics 2021).</p>

<p>Digital barriers also impacted the extent to which people with learning disabilities were able to connect with others, and access support during the pandemic. This reduction or removal of support increased social isolation and uncertainty, and contributed to increased feelings of loneliness (Source: Scottish Commission for Learning Disability 2020; Seale 2020).</p>

<p>Digital Lifeline was an emergency response to a clear and pressing need.</p>

<p>We asked people to tell us what prevents them from accessing the internet (or using it more) at home. People could select more than one barrier.</p>

<p>The most common barriers to using the internet at home were having a disability or health condition (53%) and not being able to afford a device (48%). Digital Lifeline met these head-on by providing a tablet (chosen for value and accessibility), connectivity and access to specialist support.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Who we supported</h2>

<p>Among Digital Lifeline participants, people with conditions that impact their lives a lot were around 10% more likely to agree that their digital skills had improved and/or they felt more confident in general - compared to those whose conditions impact their lives a little. This may reflect: a starting point of deeper digital exclusion; and/or the benefits of extra specialist support.</p>

<p>Older adults were less likely to experience some of the benefits measured in the survey, despite typically receiving more hours of support than younger adults. This may reflect: prior level of internet use; skills of those supporting them; and/or age-related cognitive ability to learn skills quickly.</p>

<p>Around one fifth of people live alone. They typically reported better outcomes than those in supported housing and worse outcomes than those living with partners or children. People living alone experienced the best outcomes of all groups for gaining video calling skills (44%) and the second best outcomes for feeling less lonely (53%), learning to use devices for interests and hobbies (65%) and overall improvement in digital skills (66%).</p>

<p>Across demographic groups, the main aims for device use were similar - although younger people and those from minority ethnic groups were more likely to say they would use their devices for learning, training, work or business.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Early impacts — achieving goals</h2>

<p>This section summarises the main areas where people achieved goals. (Source: Good Things Foundation analysis of Digital Lifeline survey data. By 3 August 2021, baseline surveys had been completed for 5,356 people, and early impact surveys completed for 4,759 people.)</p>

<h3>Achieving personal goals</h3>

<p>19% learnt how to do a video call for the first time. The most common goals were to connect with friends and family, for interests and hobbies, and to connect with support. Digital Lifeline helped people achieve these. Nearly 7 in 10 felt more confident in general, and over half felt more connected (57%) and less lonely (52%).</p>

<h3>Learning digital skills</h3>

<p>64% felt their digital skills got better. Through Digital Lifeline, 25% of people felt they improved their skills in finding information, and 63% either learnt how to use their device for their interests for the first time or improved at this. Some wanted to learn more skills, such as using online health services (20%) and shopping online (18%).</p>

<h3>Staying safe</h3>

<p>32% improved their online safety skills. Even in the short period (2 - 4 weeks) between data collection points, one third of people who had worries about internet risks at the start said they felt more confident staying safe online as a result of the support they received. At least 13% learnt to do this for the first time.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span> Sustained impacts — How people are using their devices</h2>

<p>Most people we spoke to during the qualitative evaluation (between 4 - 7 months later) were still using their tablet regularly. Over half were using it at least once a day.</p>

<p>People were mainly using their tablet for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connection:</strong> to connect with their families and friends, through video calls, or social media.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hobbies and interests:</strong> to explore hobbies and interests — either by engaging in these online, or searching for opportunities to engage with hobbies and interests offline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keeping active:</strong> to stay active either via activities on Zoom (such as Zumba classes), or finding out about activities in the community and accessing those.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> to learn — in some instances this could entail learning new digital skills, in other cases this could link to their engagement with hobbies or interests.</p>

<h3>Muhammad’s story</h3>

<p>Muhammad’s tablet allowed him to be more active, learn new things, become more comfortable with technology, grow in confidence and interact with others.  He used his tablet so much he ran out of data.</p>

<p>When describing how he uses his tablet, Muhammad said, “it actually introduced me to a new hobby, which was drawing.”</p>

<p>He also explained that he had used the tablet to join a drama group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In the drama group online, we were learning how to use a basic form of sign language to sing a song called Lean on Me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Muhammad also joined a shared reading group, describing it as “sharing things from your life. It was intriguing and interesting for people to be able to relate to each other and have a chat.”</p>

<p>In addition to this, Muhammad also used his tablet to represent his organisation at a community organising conference, where he “talked about setting up groups to facilitate for people who have been stuck and have not been able to get out of their houses.”</p>

<p>He said that “it felt good to be representing [my organisation].”</p>

<h3>Lucy’s story</h3>

<p>The first thing Lucy did with her tablet was install a Braille keyboard on it. She said: “We looked on the internet at downloading apps that were accessible for the blind, we got it from AbilityNet, and we were able to put a Braille keyboard on it so that I can type in Braille. […] it is amazing.”</p>

<p>She is now using her tablet for social media, Google and checking the weather. She expressed the difference that having a tablet with a Braille keyboard made in her life, saying: “It’s been brilliant. It’s opened up a lot of opportunities to be able to look up certain things on the internet and look up things in more depth.”</p>

<p>Lucy also expressed interest and enthusiasm in learning how to do new tasks, including shopping online, FaceTime, sending emails, and listening to music.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Alleviating digital exclusion</h2>

<p>Digital Lifeline has alleviated digital exclusion for people with learning disabilities, and their support networks, in a number of important ways:</p>

<h3>Improved digital access</h3>

<p>Everyone who was supported through Digital Lifeline had previously been unable to access the internet. In some cases, the tablet and data provided to a person was the first device and connection in the household, or the first device of its kind in the household.</p>

<h3>Improved digital skills</h3>

<p>Many people now feel comfortable using their tablet to speak to friends and family, learn new things, and engage with their hobbies and interests. Many family members and carers have improved their digital skills too — either  through attending community partner training, or through people passing on the skills they have learned. When surveyed after 3-4 weeks, 64% of people agreed that their digital skills had improved.</p>

<h3>Increased motivation and confidence to get online, and do more things online</h3>

<p>The vast majority of people we spoke to wanted to continue using and learning new things on their tablet. And, Digital Lifeline has also helped families and carers to see the value of the internet to those they support — making them more likely to encourage the people they support to continue with their learning.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The biggest improvement is switching it on and looking at stuff.  It sounds really basic, but it really is that basic for a lot of people who have not had access to this before.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Mitigating wider inequalities</h2>

<p>In addition to alleviating digital exclusion, Digital Lifeline helped to mitigate, or reduce inequalities that people with learning disabilities experience (many of which worsened during the pandemic):</p>

<h3>Reduced social isolation and feelings of loneliness</h3>

<p>Having access to a device and a connection enabled many people to maintain, deepen or forge new connections with others. People said that being able to communicate and connect with others achieved through Digital Lifeline, has helped them to feel less lonely and isolated. When surveyed after 3-4 weeks: 57% of people said they felt more connected; 52% of people said they felt less lonely.</p>

<h3>Improved health and wellbeing</h3>

<p>People explained that receiving the device has helped them to feel happier and more relaxed. A lot of people also noted that having a device had facilitated positive outcomes in relation to their physical and mental health by helping them to stay active.</p>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Enabling independence and participation</h2>

<p>The confidence that people have gained through using their device and learning new digital skills has also led to them feeling more empowered in other areas of their lives.</p>

<h3>Greater independence and autonomy</h3>

<p>Having a device that they own has enabled people the power to use their tablet for things that interest them. They are proud of the digital skills they have learned, and through learning new digital skills many people have also developed an improved sense of their own abilities. When surveyed after 3-4 weeks 68% of beneficiaires said they felt more confident.</p>

<h3>Improved ability to participate in society</h3>

<p>In some instances, receiving a device has helped people to contribute to their local community. Several people who were using their device for volunteering talked about the importance of giving up your time and using their digital device to access work and contribute during the pandemic.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Just to have the responsibility to look after my own tablet and keep it safe, It makes me feel good to have my own tablet so I can use it. The responsibility makes me feel like I can prove that I can look after other things.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Impacts on community partners — building capacity</h2>

<p>Digital Lifeline has helped community partners to build their capacity to support people with learning disabilities in a number of positive ways:</p>

<h3>Greater understanding of specialist support available</h3>

<p>Digital Lifeline helped to highlight a range of specialist support that is available to people with learning disabilities that many community partners had previously been unaware of.</p>

<h3>Improved volunteer/staff skills &amp; confidence</h3>

<p>Many community partners used training sessions for those receiving devices as an opportunity to upskill less confident staff and volunteers.</p>

<h3>An improved support offer</h3>

<p>Community partners are now able to use the devices to complement face-to-face support, use the devices to keep in touch with people and/or provide a hybrid model of support.</p>

<h3>Mark’s story</h3>

<p>Before the pandemic, Mark enjoyed an active social life. Mark’s mum, Cheryl, says that the pandemic has been extremely isolating for him: “It’s made him lonely. I’ve had to work, so he’s spent a lot of time on his own.” Mark says: “I’ve missed my friends and the SeeAbility staff.”</p>

<p>Mark received a tablet through Digital Lifeline. Now he has his own tablet, he’s been following his church’s services online. He’s turned on a feature that reads out on screen text - now he loves to have the news read to him every day.</p>

<p>Mark has been able to attend his day centre online via video call and is thrilled to have reconnected with his friends he hasn’t seen since the pandemic began. He says that he now doesn’t feel left out. And Cheryl is comfortable in the knowledge that he’s able to have some fun and chat with friends while she works.</p>

<h3>Bruce’s story</h3>

<p>Before the pandemic, Bruce enjoyed walking, the pub, taking part in activities at the SeeAbility Millennium Centre, and visiting his family. The restrictions have meant he’s been unable to see his mum and other family for long periods. Bruce hasn’t had his own device and has had to share with other residents in the care home where he lives.</p>

<p>Thanks to Digital Lifeline, Bruce received his own tablet. Now he can speak to his family as often as he likes. Bruce loves to take photos of the world around him. The new tablet has given him the freedom to take as many photos as he likes, and share them with his family. Louise, one of Bruce’s key workers, says:</p>

<p>“Bruce is taking the lead and seeing what he enjoys doing. We’re trying different activities and then it’s his choice how he uses the tablet.”</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Recommendations</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Recommendations for policy makers:</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Embed digital inclusion into government policies and programmes to improve the lives of people with learning disabilities and disabled people more generally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote digital inclusion for those at most risk of being left behind in the new Digital Strategy — such as disabled people and people with learning disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognise the value of community-based learning and development, and fund community organisations to help people build confidence and learn digital skills simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take action to reduce data poverty and address barriers to device ownership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address the data and knowledge gap in relation to people with learning disabilities. We still do not know enough about the digital experiences and barriers faced by people with learning disabilities and how this relates to wider characteristics of the population of people with learning disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Recommendations for funders:</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Take action to ensure that the people supported through Digital Lifeline can continue to develop their skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fund more, and longer term, digital inclusion programmes to support people with learning disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest in improving the digital access, skills and confidence of the social care workforce, disabled people’s organisations and self advocacy groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide funding to improve the digital access, skills and confidence of family members and informal carers, so they can, in turn, help the people they support to get online.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Recommendations for practitioners:</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Identify and address any organisational barriers to delivering digital inclusion support — such as gaps in digital infrastructure and/or a lack of digital confidence, motivation, and skills among staff and volunteers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support staff / volunteers to be confident in encouraging people with learning disabilities to explore the full potential of the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide clear, accessible information about what digital and data support is being provided to avoid confusion.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> Lessons for future programmes</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Keep</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cross-sector collaboration meant the Fund reached target groups at scale and quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partnering with community and specialist providers enabled a non-stigmatising, trust-based approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expert procurement by Good Things Foundation meant public money was well spent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partners liked that devices were given (not loaned) and new (not old or refurbished); this aided support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partners welcomed the grant of  £100 per person to contribute to time and costs of providing support.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Change</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>24GB of data connectivity was valued, but not enough for everyone’s needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Virtual workshops to do a live ‘set up’ could help - setting up devices was a main pain point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow more time to set up devices before distributing them, and to follow up with participants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further improve online resources, like Learn My Way, for people with learning disabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase grants to cover extra time needed to engage people with more complex support needs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Extend</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Extend support to improve digital access and confidence of family carers, social care staff, self advocacy groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extend promotion to care providers and community groups about free support (e.g. AbilityNet, Good Things Foundation, Learn My Way).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spread the word about free accessibility Apps and easy ways to adjust settings.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Extend support to reduce data poverty, and help people keep on learning.</p>
