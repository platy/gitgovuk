<p>We will shortly publish <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sfa-funding-rates#adult-education-budget-(aeb)">version 4 of the adult education budget (AEB) funding rates and formula guide for 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<p>This guide covers 2020 to 2021 and is our current advice for the funding year. We know that providers are working through exceptional circumstances due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>We may publish further updates about the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance as these become clear. We will tell you about any changes in ESFA Update.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: update on the Get Help with Technology programme</h2>

<p>The Get Help with Technology service is currently being rolled out to further education providers with eligible students, meaning that providers will be able to order devices and to request 4G wireless routers for financially disadvantaged students without broadband at home. Information about the service was provided in the ESFA bulletin on 20 January.</p>

<p>Further education providers are currently being invited to join the service in waves, and we expect that the majority of eligible further education providers will have been invited to join the service before the end of January. <strong>Please note you cannot access the service until you have been invited to do so via an email from the Department for Education</strong>.</p>

<p>Once providers have joined the service and placed an order for devices, they will also be eligible to request 4G wireless routers for financially disadvantaged students who do not have a broadband connection at home. Under the GHWT service devices are being provided based on an estimate of a provider’s device needs (based on free meals data and estimates of prior device ownership) however the provision of wireless routers will be based on actual need. This is because within the GHWT service, the need for connectivity has been far lower than the need for devices. In order to make a request for wireless routers for your students you will need to provide information about how you have identified the number of learners requiring connectivity solutions. DfE will be looking for confirmation that you have identified which disadvantaged learners do not have broadband at home through for example, contact with students/parents, surveys etc. In providing evidence of need you should not include any personal information about the students such as their names, addresses or date of birth.</p>

<p>Please note that the free data offer being provided by mobile network operators for children in schools (years 3 to 11) does not currently extend to young people aged 16-19 in schools or FE providers, therefore we encourage providers to request wireless routers through the GHWT service for young people aged 16-19 (and those aged 19+ with EHCPs) who cannot afford mobile data and who do not have broadband at home.</p>

<p>We would like to encourage FE providers to <strong>update the number of students in receipt of free meals in the mandatory R06 ILR data return due 4 February</strong>, as this will help to inform the GHWT service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: college financial dashboards now live</h2>

<p>A new tool has been developed for colleges that allows you to visualise and analyse the financial data you submit to ESFA.</p>

<p>The dashboards provide helpful visuals across a range of areas of college finances. They support colleges to compare their financial performance and forecasts across data returns. We have worked closely with college finance staff on the design and testing of the dashboards.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Your feedback is important</h3>

<p>We’re really keen to see the future development of this tool being led by colleges. Following this initial release to all colleges we would welcome feedback on how we can make further improvements to support college finance staff and board members. There is a link within the ‘Notes’ tab of the tool which can be used to provide feedback.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>How to get access</h3>

<p>The tool is available now on <a rel="external" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">view your education data (VYED)</a>. You will need an Identity and Access Management System (IDAMS) account to get access to the tool. To get an IDAMS account follow the link above. Once in VYED, you will also need to request the ‘View Your Education Data – College Financials’ role.</p>

<p>Your setting ‘super user’ will need to approve requests for those who need access to the dashboards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: 16 to 18 in-year growth process</h2>

<p>We can confirm that we will be running an in-year growth process for 16 to 18 delivery during February. We will contact the providers who are eligible for growth funding by the end of February 2021.</p>

<p>The growth process will be purely data driven, so providers must not send business cases as we cannot accept them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Information: find an end-point assessment organisation</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Find an end-point assessment organisation</a> is a new function the apprenticeship service has developed to enable employers and training providers to find end-point assessors that deliver assessments for the standard their apprentice is completing.</p>

<p>The function allows employers and providers to search for the apprenticeship training that needs to be assessed and view all available end-point assessors who can deliver the assessment. If there is more than one assessment organisation for the selected standard, you will be shown a list of all available organisations to choose from.</p>

<p>For any queries, please contact the Apprenticeship Service on 08000 150 600.</p>
