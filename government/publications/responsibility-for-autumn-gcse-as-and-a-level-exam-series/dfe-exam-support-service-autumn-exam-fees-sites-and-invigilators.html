<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>This guidance is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school and college senior leaders</li>
  <li>heads of other types of exam centre offering <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSEs</abbr>, A/<abbr title="Advanced Subsidiary level">AS level</abbr> or vocational and technical qualification (<abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr>) exams</li>
  <li>exams officers and other staff involved in exam delivery</li>
  <li>local authorities and multi-academy trusts (<abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>All exams due to take place in schools and colleges in summer 2020 were cancelled as part of the public health response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Whilst the majority of students have received grades which will enable them to progress, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-03-23/HCWS176/">students will have the option to sit <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>, <abbr title="Advanced level">A level</abbr> and <abbr title="Advanced Subsidiary level">AS level</abbr> exams in autumn 2020</a> and some vocational and technical qualification (<abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr>) students will be able to sit their exams in autumn 2020 and spring 2021. Students can sit exams if they are unhappy with their summer grade or if they need an improved result to move onto the next stage of their education. There will also be a small group of students where there was not enough evidence for a grade to be awarded in the summer, and it is particularly important that these students are able to sit exams.</p>

<p>This guidance outlines the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service - an extensive support package to help schools and colleges with essential additional costs associated with running exams in the autumn, including exam fees charged by awarding organisations, alternative sites and invigilation.</p>

<p>It provides guidance about the service so schools, colleges and other registered exam centres can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make reimbursement claims for any deficit between their autumn exam fees and summer savings from exam fee rebates</li>
  <li>use a government approved supplier to book fully funded alternative sites, if it is not possible to run exams on their own premises without disrupting study</li>
  <li>make their own arrangements for alternative sites (subject to the criteria set out in this guidance) and claim back the full cost</li>
  <li>use a government approved supplier to book suitable and Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) checked individuals for invigilator roles</li>
  <li>claim back invigilation costs (for autumn exam invigilation costs which exceed the savings made on summer invigilation)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series/centre-responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series-guidance">guidance on schools and colleges’ responsibilities for the autumn exams</a>, which includes expectations for paying exam fees.</p>

<p>If you have further queries about using the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service that are not answered in this guidance, please contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/fillform.php?self=1&amp;form_id=HR41uA2F8Dh&amp;type=form&amp;ShowMsg=1&amp;form_name=Knowledge+centre+enquiry+form&amp;noRegister=false&amp;ret=/module/services&amp;noLoginPrompt=1">ESFA helpdesk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Eligibility</h3>

<p>This support is available to all types of schools, colleges and other exam centres who planned to enter pupils for 2020 summer exams and assessments which were cancelled, and as a result will be running the <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>, <abbr title="Advanced level">A level</abbr> and <abbr title="Advanced Subsidiary level">AS level</abbr> and <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> exams in autumn 2020 and <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> exams in spring 2021 (referred to as ‘autumn exams’ in the rest of this guidance). In order to ensure that no student is disadvantaged when sitting autumn exams and assessments, this support will cover all schools, colleges and other centres and not just those in the state-funded sector.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state-funded schools</li>
  <li>further education, sixth-form and tertiary colleges</li>
  <li>independent training providers</li>
  <li>apprenticeship providers who deliver functional skills qualification (<abbr title="Functional Skills Qualification">FSQ</abbr>) assessment in the workplace</li>
  <li>independent schools</li>
  <li>adult and community learning providers</li>
  <li>private exam centres</li>
</ul>

<p>In the rest of this guidance, the term ‘schools and colleges’ is used to refer to all types of exam centre as detailed above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Exams and assessments in scope</h3>

<p>The service will provide support for the following qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A and AS levels and <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSEs</abbr> (with the exception below)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> and other general qualifications at level 1 / 2, level 2 and level 3, where students received grades in summer 2020 and there is a scheduled assessment opportunity for the qualification in the autumn or spring series</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> in English and maths at level 1 and 2 undertaken by apprentices, where the apprentice was due to take the exam in their workplace, but the workplace is inaccessible due to coronavirus (COVID-19) - other <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> are not supported</li>
</ul>

<p>The service will cover apprenticeship training providers who need additional space or invigilation to deliver <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualification">FSQ</abbr> exams for apprentices only, and only where apprentices were due to sit those exams in workplaces that have been inaccessible due to coronavirus (COVID-19). The lead provider must make the booking or claim. The service will not cover <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualification">FSQ</abbr> assessment fees as these are planned assessments providers will have covered from funding via their provider funding agreement. This support does not apply to other <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> run in classroom-based provision, for apprentices who can access an assessment on provider premises or remotely, or for students apart from apprentices.</p>

<p>The service will not cover <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> English and maths exams taken by students who did not achieve a grade 4 or higher in these subjects. Resit exams take place in November in a normal academic year and schools and colleges will have planned and budgeted for them. The service will cover <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> English and maths exams for students who achieved a grade 4 or above and wish to try to improve their result.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>When to use the service</h3>

<p>You can use the service for some, or all, of the autumn exams, depending on your own circumstances. You may also work collaboratively with other schools and colleges (for example, other schools in your multi-academy trust (MAT) or local authority) to run exams where this meets <a href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Joint Council for Qualifications’s instructions for conducting examinations</a> or, in the case of <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> and <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr>, arrangements specified by the relevant awarding organisation.</p>

<p>You should first establish whether you have capacity to accommodate exams using your existing sites and staff before booking alternative sites or invigilators. You may also want to consider whether collaborative arrangements with other schools and colleges in your area could be possible. The circumstances of each school or college will vary – many will be able to accommodate all exams with their own sites or staff, or through collaboration with other schools or colleges nearby. Others may be able to accommodate some exams within their sites but need support to run larger entry subjects.</p>

<p>The financial support available is the same regardless of whether you use the government approved suppliers to book alternative sites or invigilators, or make your own arrangements. You should therefore make a decision about which option to use based on what is best in the circumstances for your school or college and for students.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Service availability</h3>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service to book alternative sites and invigilators if required through our government approved suppliers.</p>

<p>The service claims process will open later in the year for schools and colleges to make claims for costs relating to exam fees, invigilators and alternative sites as set out later in this guidance, alongside further guidance on how to make a claim.</p>

<p>The booking service and claims process for invigilation and alternative sites will remain open into the spring term 2021 to cover some <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> assessments taking place at that time that had not been available in the autumn term. The bookings service will not be available for <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualification">FSQ</abbr> exams beyond 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Support for paying exam fees</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service will provide financial support to schools and colleges to ensure that they do not incur a net loss, taking together their autumn fees and any rebates or credit notes they receive for summer 2020 exams and assessments. This will also apply to fees incurred for entering students in autumn 2020 or spring 2021 to sit <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> for which they received results in summer 2020. This does not apply to <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualification">FSQ</abbr> assessment exam fees, as providers will cover these as usual via their ESFA funding agreements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Funding eligibility criteria for exam fees</h3>

<p>You will receive notification of any rebates or credit notes on summer exam fees from your awarding organisation. We anticipate that the rebates or credit notes schools or colleges receive will cover the costs of the autumn exams in many cases. You must use these rebates to cover autumn fees in the first instance. If your additional fees for the autumn exams exceed any summer savings you receive, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will provide funding to cover this deficit.</p>

<p>We will not provide funding for any administrative fees charged by schools and colleges, over and above the fees charged by the awarding organisations. We do not expect schools and colleges to charge administrative fees to students who were entered for exams in the summer. Where private candidates have already paid an administrative fee for the summer, we would not expect them to be charged twice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>What you will need to make a funding claim for fees</h3>

<p>You need to keep evidence of your autumn fees and summer fee rebates or credit notes received for inspection. We will review claims and may refuse payment or require repayment for any claims that do not meet the criteria set out in this guidance. You should therefore ensure that you keep records of this expenditure and the related evidence for at least one year.</p>

<p>In order to receive payments against any claim, you will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe" class="govuk-link">provide information about your banking and payments to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>. You will also need to enter your 8-digit UK provider registration number (<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>). If you do not know the <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> for your school or college, you can find it on <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Get information about schools</a>. If you do not have a <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1" class="govuk-link">register as a UK learning provider</a>. If your school or college isn’t already set up with a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> sign-in</a> or <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>, you should set this up in advance of making a claim so that payment is not delayed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Support for alternative exam sites</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service will provide logistical and financial support to schools and colleges to find alternative sites to run the autumn exams where it is not possible to run them on their own sites (or collaboratively) without disruption to study.</p>

<p>You need to make sure that you follow <a href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/online-forms/guidance-notes-on-alternative-site-arrangements/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">JCQ guidance on alternative site arrangements</a> or appropriate guidance for <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> and <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualification">FSQ</abbr> assessments set by the awarding organisation. This includes ensuring that you make bookings in time to inform them of your alternative site for exams. For <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>, AS and <abbr title="Advanced level">A level</abbr> exams, this means that for any exams that will be conducted at an address other than your school or college’s registered address, you will need to notify the JCQ Centre Inspection Service by 18 September 2020 for AS and <abbr title="Advanced level">A level</abbr> exams, or 16 October 2020 for <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> exams. You must complete the JCQ Alternative Site form online using the Centre Admin Portal (CAP). CAP can be accessed via any of the exam boards’ secure extranet sites.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Booking alternative sites through an approved supplier</h3>

<p>You can use the government’s approved venue supplier if you require alternative sites. You can book sites using the online form below and agree arrangements with the supplier. The supplier will book sites and arrange set up of the venue according to the school or college’s requirements, including arranging desks and rooms for candidates with reasonable adjustment requirements. It will also arrange cleaning of the venue in line with public health requirements.</p>

<p>For state-funded schools and colleges, sites booked through the government’s approved supplier will be fully funded and you should not make a claim. Independent schools and private exam centres will be invoiced by the supplier and you will need to make claims to cover the costs.</p>

<p>For apprenticeship <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr>, only the lead provider can access the service or make a claim. They can support apprentices where the delivery has been subcontracted in line with the ESFA funding rules, but they must retain ownership of bookings and claims.</p>

<h4>How to book alternative exam sites</h4>

<p>You can <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://pst.myeventsportal.co.uk/clientform/dfeexams">book alternative exam sites using the government’s approved venue supplier</a> by completing the online form.</p>

<p>You will need to enter your 8-digit UK provider registration number (<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>). If you do not know the <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> for your school or college, you can find it on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get information about schools</a>. If you do not have a <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> you can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1">register as a UK learning provider</a> and should do this as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will need the following information to book an alternative exam site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name, address and postcode of your school or college</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> of your school or college</li>
  <li>for <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>, AS and A levels, exam centre number of your school or college</li>
  <li>name, email address and phone number of the main contact (usually the exams officer) for the school or college</li>
  <li>email address of the main contact’s line manager</li>
  <li>details of the exams for which you wish to book alternative sites (including exam name, awarding organisation, specification/qualification number, date and time)</li>
  <li>number of attendees (candidates and invigilators) for each exam</li>
  <li>set-up requirements</li>
</ul>

<h4>Responsibilities of the school or college</h4>

<p>Where you use the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service to book alternative sites, it is your responsibility to check the venue offered within 24 hours and confirm that it is suitable. You will need to check that it meets JCQ guidelines or those of appropriate awarding organisations for <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> and <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr>. You retain responsibility for running the exams, including ensuring that exams operate in the new venue as per <a href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">JCQ’s guidance on conducting exams</a> or appropriate guidance for <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> and <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> assessments set by the awarding organisation. You are also responsible for managing candidates, including on arrival and departure.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>, AS and <abbr title="Advanced level">A level</abbr> exams, this means that you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the site is suitable and meets JCQ requirements - set up arrangements can be specified on booking the site through the approved supplier</li>
  <li>ensure you follow <a rel="external" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/online-forms/guidance-notes-on-alternative-site-arrangements/" class="govuk-link">JCQ guidance on alternative site arrangements</a> and submit the relevant forms to JCQ</li>
  <li>arrange secure transport of exam papers to the alternative site and secure return to the school or college, where they will be collected as usual</li>
  <li>arrange invigilation as per JCQ requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>The venue will have evacuation and first aid procedures in place, which will be shared with you. You will be responsible for ensuring that invigilators or exams officers brief candidates about evacuation procedures before each exam starts.</p>

<p>Schools and colleges will be responsible for paying any cancellation charges for confirmed bookings cancelled within 2 weeks of the planned exam date. We and our approved supplier will reserve the right to seek repayment for any cancellation fee incurred unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Funding eligibility criteria for booking your own alternative site</h3>

<p>If you prefer not to use our supplier, you can book your own alternative sites and submit claims to us along with supporting evidence. The claims process will open later in the autumn term. You should follow school <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-procedures-and-procurement-law-for-schools">procurement rules</a> when making your own arrangements.</p>

<p>You should submit your claim after the exam has taken place because cancellations charges will not be covered unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.</p>

<p>Claims for alternative site costs can include associated set up and cleaning costs for the venue where necessary. The service will not provide funding if you are using your own premises to facilitate exams.</p>

<p>When booking venues, we would expect costs to reflect local rates. We have set out an illustrative table below and we would not generally expect costs to fall outside these ranges unless there are exceptional circumstances. These illustrative costs include cleaning of the venue and are based on candidates being spaced 2 metres apart. The lower level of £0 reflects the venue costs incurred in the case where schools are able to use their own facilities. Bookings made through our approved supplier will use the same cost framework.</p>

<p>Where you book your own site and costs are outside of the rates shown, you should provide evidence to support your claim, for example by sourcing a range of quotes. <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> reserves the right to fund on the basis of the rates shown below if this evidence is not provided.</p>

<p>When booking rooms for over 100 candidates, you must get 3 quotes to confirm value for money and submit these as part of your claim. You will also need to provide an explanation should you not select the lowest quote.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>What you will need to make a funding claim for alternative sites</h3>

<p>There are a number of different scenarios where you may wish to make a claim for alternative site costs.</p>

<p><strong>State-funded schools or colleges that booked sites through the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service approved supplier</strong></p>

<p>Site costs will be covered automatically through the booking process when state-funded schools and colleges book through the service’s approved supplier. You should not make a separate claim for costs through the service.</p>

<p><strong>Independent schools and colleges or private exam centres that booked venues through the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service approved supplier</strong></p>

<p>You will be invoiced by the supplier for the cost of the site booking. You can then claim back the booking cost from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service.</p>

<p><strong>Schools and colleges that did not use the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service approved supplier and made their own arrangements</strong></p>

<p>If you made local arrangements to book sites, either acting individually or in collaboration with other schools or colleges, then the school or college that made the arrangement and paid for the site will be able to enter a claim through the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service.</p>

<p>In order to receive payments against any claim, you will need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe" class="govuk-link">provide information about your banking and payments to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>. You will also need to enter your 8-digit UK provider registration number (<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>). If you do not know the <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> for your school or college, you can find it on <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Get information about schools</a>. If you do not have a <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1" class="govuk-link">register as a UK learning provider</a>. If your school or college isn’t already set up with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> sign-in</a> or <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>, you should set this up in advance of making a claim so that payment is not delayed.</p>

<p>You will need to keep evidence of your expenditure for inspection, including invoices, along with evidence of seeking value for money, for example through a range of quotes. We will review claims and may refuse payment or require repayment for any claims that do not meet the criteria set out in this guidance. You should therefore ensure that you keep records of this expenditure and the related evidence for at least one year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Support for invigilation</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service will provide logistical and financial support to schools and colleges to book invigilators for the autumn exams.</p>

<p>You can use the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service to book Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) checked individuals who are suitable for the invigilator role through an approved supplier. Alternatively, if you require additional invigilators, you can make local arrangements to book invigilators. You should follow procurement rules when making your own arrangements.</p>

<p>For either type of booking, you will be able to claim back invigilation costs for autumn exam invigilation costs which exceed the savings made on summer invigilation. The process for making claims is set out later in this guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Booking invigilators through an approved supplier</h3>

<p>In many cases, schools and colleges will already have a pool of invigilators available to use for the autumn exams. In some instances, however, they may not have sufficient invigilators available. Where you do not have sufficient invigilators, you can use the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service to book additional <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checked individuals. Your school or college will be invoiced for the cost of this directly by the supplier.</p>

<h4>How to book invigilators</h4>

<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.randstad.co.uk/employers/areas-of-expertise/education/find-invigilators/" class="govuk-link">book <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checked individuals through an approved supplier</a> by completing the online form.</p>

<p>You will need to enter your 8-digit UK Provider Registration Number (<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>). If you do not know the <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> for your centre, you can find it on <a rel="external" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Get information about schools</a>. If you do not have a <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> you can <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1" class="govuk-link">register as a UK learning provider</a> and should do this as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In order to complete the form to book <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checked individuals for invigilation, you will need the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name, address and postcode of your school or college</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> of your school or college</li>
  <li>name, email address and phone number of the main contact (usually the exams officer) for the school or college</li>
  <li>dates and times you wish to book invigilation for (this should include time for both invigilator training and the exams)</li>
  <li>number of <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checked individuals required</li>
  <li>address that <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> checked individuals will need to attend for exams or training</li>
</ul>

<h4>Responsibilities of the school or college</h4>

<p>If you use the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service to book <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>-checked individuals, you still retain responsibility to ensure that exams operate in line with <a href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">JCQ’s instructions for conducting exams</a> or appropriate guidance for <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> and <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> set by the awarding organisation as usual. This means that you will need to ensure that invigilators have received suitable training and are briefed on how to run the exams.</p>

<p>You will need to consider how and when to deliver training to the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>-checked individuals that you book through the approved supplier. You should allow sufficient time to arrange training in advance of exams taking place when making your booking.</p>

<p>Please refer to <a rel="external" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations/" class="govuk-link">JCQ’s instructions for conducting exams</a> for information about the roles and responsibilities of invigilators, the ratios of invigilators to candidates and the training requirements for invigilators. For those <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> and <abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> in scope, please refer to the guidance issued by the awarding organisation you are working with.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Funding eligibility criteria for invigilation costs</h3>

<p>Most schools and colleges will have made savings on invigilation costs, following the cancellation of summer exams. Whether you book through our preferred supplier or make your own arrangements for invigilators, you will be able to claim back the deficit if your autumn invigilation costs exceed your summer invigilation savings, following the cancellation of exams and assessments - this includes training time. You should not make any changes to the arrangements you have already made for summer invigilator payments as a result of this guidance, this applies to <abbr title="General Certificates of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>, <abbr title="Advanced level">A level</abbr>, <abbr title="Advanced Subsidiary level">AS level</abbr> and <abbr title="vocational and technical qualifications">VTQs</abbr> only (<abbr title="Functional Skills Qualifications">FSQs</abbr> are only eligible as set out in section 1.2).</p>

<p>You should keep records of exams administered and you may be asked to provide an explanation if you are claiming for high invigilator to student ratios. We would expect you to follow <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations/">JCQ’s instructions for conducting exams</a> or appropriate awarding organisation recommendations on the number of invigilators required for each exam, unless you can demonstrate exceptional circumstances, for example those relating to reasonable adjustments or access arrangements. The service will not provide funding for travel costs. You should submit your claim after the exam has taken place because we will not cover cancellation charges unless you can show there were exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h4>What you’ll need to make a funding claim for invigilation</h4>

<p>You can claim to cover the costs of invigilation for the autumn exams from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> exam support service if your autumn invigilation fees exceed invigilation savings you have made in the summer, following the cancellation of exams and assessments.</p>

<p>You will need to keep evidence of your expenditure for inspection, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>records of actual summer 2020 invigilation costs - for example, any payments made to invigilation in relation to coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
  <li>evidence of the school or college’s usual summer invigilation costs, including any training costs - we would expect this to be costs of invigilation for 2019</li>
  <li>records of autumn 2020 invigilation costs, including any training costs</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to receive payments against any claim, you will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provide-information-about-your-banking-and-payments-to-dfe">provide information about your banking and payments to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>. You will also need to enter your 8-digit UK provider registration number (<abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>). If you do not know the <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> for your school or college, you can find it on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/">Get information about schools</a>. If you do not have a <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr> you can <a href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1" class="govuk-link" rel="external">register as a UK learning provider</a>. If your school or college isn’t already set up with a <a rel="external" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> sign-in</a> or <abbr title="UK Provider Registration Number">UKPRN</abbr>, you should set this up in advance of making a claim so that payment is not delayed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will review claims and may refuse payment or require repayment for any claims that do not meet the criteria set out in this guidance. You should therefore ensure that you keep records of this expenditure and the related evidence for at least a year.</p>
