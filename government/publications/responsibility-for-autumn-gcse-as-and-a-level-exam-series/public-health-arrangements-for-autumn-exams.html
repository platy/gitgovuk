<h2>Preparing for and running exams</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 infection prevention measures</h3>

<p>Centres should continue to implement the latest COVID-19 infection prevention measures. See the sector guidance relevant for your setting for the latest measures (links are at the top of this document).</p>

<p>Information on what circumstances might lead you to consider taking additional action, and the steps you should work through, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings">contingency framework</a>.</p>

<h2>Arrival and departure of candidates</h2>

<p>Candidates should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">safer travel guidance</a> before planning their journey to their exam, especially where the exam is being held in a location to which the candidate does not normally travel.</p>

<p>Staff and candidates should follow wider advice on face coverings outside of education settings, including on transport to and from education. Face coverings are no longer advised within education settings whilst arriving for or leaving exams.</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>

<p>Centres should put in place and maintain an appropriate cleaning schedule for rooms where exams are being sat.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has published guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning of non-healthcare settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Set up of the exam room</h3>

<p>Exam rooms should be set up in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ICE_21-22_v6.pdf" rel="external">Joint Council of Qualifications (<abbr title="Joint Council of Qualifications">JCQ</abbr>) guidance</a>. Additional steps - for example greater spacing between desks - are no longer necessary.</p>

<h3>Face coverings during exams</h3>

<p>We would not ordinarily expect candidates and invigilators to wear face coverings during exams but they may wear them if they wish to do so and settings should be sensitive to the needs of individuals.</p>

<p>If your education setting operates commercial training environments, such as hairdressing, barbering and beauty salons, sports and fitness facilities or restaurants, they must comply with any relevant sector guidance in working safely during COVID-19.</p>

<p>For the latest guidance on face coverings -– see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">face coverings, when to wear one, exemptions and how to make your own</a>.</p>

<p>No candidate should be denied access to an exam on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering.</p>

<h3>Invigilators</h3>

<p>Your centre will have protocols in place for visitors and temporary staff. Invigilators can move between different centres and should be treated in the same way as supply and peripatetic staff. Further guidance about supply and peripatetic staff is in the school workforce section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak#school-workforce">actions for schools during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>Face coverings are no longer advised for invigilators, but they may wear them if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>Invigilators do not need to wear gloves when collecting exam scripts from candidates but should wash their hands thoroughly and more frequently than usual and particularly after handling exam papers.</p>

<h3>Exam support service</h3>

<p>We have provided an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series/dfe-exam-support-service-autumn-exam-fees-sites-and-invigilators">exam support service</a> for the autumn exam series, including <abbr title="vocational and technical qualification">VTQ</abbr> exams in autumn 2021 and spring 2022 which are being used as a resit opportunity for students awarded a TAG in 2021. This allows centres to claim for essential costs associated with running exams, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>additional venue space</li>
  <li>invigilation</li>
  <li>invigilator training</li>
  <li>exam fees charged by awarding organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>Centres supporting students resitting GCSE English or maths under the condition of funding will be able to claim for costs relating to additional venue space and invigilation.</p>

<p>In addition we have extended  the exam support service to centres running exams and assessments in January, February and March 2022 that are not being run as part of the autumn series (that is, are not a resit opportunity for students who received a teacher assessed grade in summer 2021), for costs related to additional invigilators required as a result of staff absences only.</p>

<p>Further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series/dfe-exam-support-service-autumn-exam-fees-sites-and-invigilators">exam support service guidance</a> and guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/responsibility-for-autumn-gcse-as-and-a-level-exam-series/dfe-exam-support-service-autumn-exam-fees-sites-and-invigilators#support-for-invigilation">how to make claims for exams</a> is available. Funding for the exam support service is only available for exams and assessments taking place up to 31 March 2022.</p>

<h2>Candidate health</h2>

<h3>Candidates with symptoms or who have tested positive</h3>

<p>Candidates should follow guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a> if they have COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<h3>Candidates who are isolating in line with public health advice</h3>

<p>Public health advice for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">people with COVID-19 and their contacts</a> changed from 24 February. Contacts are no longer required to self-isolate or advised to take daily tests, and contact tracing has ended.</p>

<p>Candidates in quarantine following foreign travel must not attend exams during their period of quarantine. Families should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Travel to England from another country during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h3>What to do if a candidate cannot attend an exam</h3>

<p>Where a candidate is unable to attend an exam, the centre should contact the awarding organisation on the candidate’s behalf to determine the next available assessment opportunity or whether special consideration might be available.</p>

<h3>Candidates who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID-19</h3>

<p>Candidates with a weakened immune system should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk">guidance for people whose immune system means they are at higher risk</a> from COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Reasonable adjustments</h2>

<p>Educational establishments, as employers, have a duty to comply with the Equality Act 2010 which includes making reasonable adjustments for disabled staff. They also have a duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled pupils and students, to support them to access education successfully.</p>

<p>Centres must, under their Equality Act 2010 obligations, continue to make reasonable adjustments for candidates with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

<p>Each awarding organisation will have their own policy on reasonable adjustments, with which we expect centres to be familiar.</p>

<p>The special educational needs coordinator (<abbr title="special educational needs co-ordinator">SENCo</abbr>) will need to ensure that the access arrangement is still appropriate, practicable and reasonable.</p>

<p>In the event of a candidate’s circumstances changing, the <abbr title="special educational needs co-ordinator">SENCo</abbr> may (where required) need to produce evidence and process an online application.</p>
