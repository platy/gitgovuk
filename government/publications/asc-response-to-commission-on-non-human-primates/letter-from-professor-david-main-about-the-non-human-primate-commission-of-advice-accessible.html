<h2>Response to Animals in Science Policy and Co-ordination Unit commission of work on non-human primates bred for use in scientific procedures</h2>

<p>Thank you for your correspondence of 23 June 2022, commissioning advice from the Animals in Science Committee (ASC) on non-human primates bred for use in scientific procedures. The Committee has accepted this commission and has formed a subgroup to take this work forward.</p>

<p>As set out in your communication, the significant impacts on animal welfare and health, and the ethical issues associated with supply systems that involve the capture of non-human primates from the wild, must be key factors in considerations of policy in this area.</p>

<p>These impacts are well evidenced and have been acknowledged and highlighted in numerous reports over many years.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> We do not intend to repeat this work - although we will clearly incorporate and pay due regard to that existing evidence as we formulate our advice as regards the merits and potential consequences of the policy options as set out.</p>

<p>Given the short timeframe for us to provide our advice, and noting the questions on which you are seeking our advice and the specific current evidence gaps that exist, we intend to focus our evidence gathering on clarifying the breeding status of the NHPs currently supplied and used in the UK (as at July 2022) and the factors that may or may not potentially impact on this in the short and longer term. In all cases, we will be seeking clear evidence to support any position statements or other information and comment provided to us.</p>

<p>We intend to engage with organisations directly involved in the breeding, supply or use of non-human primates under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 within the UK. Other organisations relevant to the funding of studies involving NHPs in the UK, or bodies utilising the results of these, may also be contacted. This will mean that the scope of our consideration will include all species of NHPs, and both commercial and academic establishments.</p>

<p>In carrying out this commission, and in formulating our advice, we note the requirement under A(SP)A 1986 for the Animals in Science Committee to have regard both to the legitimate requirements of science and industry and to the protection of animals against avoidable suffering and unnecessary use in scientific procedures.</p>

<p>We look forward to providing you with our findings and advice, as requested, by 12 September 2022.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Professor David Main</p>

<p>Chair of the ASC</p>
