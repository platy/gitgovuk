<p>We have now reached the start of the summer series, with exams and formal assessments taking place for the first summer since 2019, representing a major step back to normality.</p>

<p>I’ve been fortunate enough to visit schools and colleges up and down the country in recent months, and have heard first hand from hundreds of students, as well as you their leaders and teachers. What has come across loud and clear from students is just how much they want exams to go ahead. Students want the opportunity to show what they know and can do.</p>

<p>They’ve also been keen to emphasise how brilliantly supported they have been by their school or college. 
So I wanted to write to you to thank you for everything that you and your colleagues do to support the smooth running of exams and assessments. Your role is vital in making sure that they go ahead effectively.</p>

<p>I also know from my conversations with school and college leaders that thinking has turned to results days. So as exams start, I want to remind you what to expect from this year’s results. And while I am sure that you are aware of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/additional-help-for-students-taking-exams-in-summer-2022-postcard">the adaptations in place for exams and assessments this year</a>, I also wanted to remind you about some key information, as well as the resources available, for schools, colleges and students that you may find helpful as we enter the exam season.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>We want to get back to pre-pandemic grading, but I don’t think it would be fair to do so in one jump. So, in 2022, rather than going straight back to pre-pandemic standards, results will reflect a staging post between 2021 and 2019.</p>

<p>Ofqual will ask the exam boards to set grade boundaries to reflect the pandemic context, to avoid disadvantaging some students who might otherwise have just missed out on a higher grade. It means that overall, 2022 results are likely to be higher than in 2019, when summer grades were last determined by exams, but lower than we saw in 2021.</p>

<p>As in any other year, grade boundaries will be set at a national level, but only after students have taken their exams, and only after their papers have been marked.  To be clear, there is no quota of students that get a particular grade. It absolutely isn’t something that is decided in advance.</p>

<h2>Information available for schools and colleges</h2>

<p>I’d also like to acknowledge the pivotal role that exams officers play in the smooth running of exams. As a former school leader, I know only too well that they are often the unsung heroes of the exam season. I know the importance of ensuring that they have the support in place that they need to do this effectively, and that contingency plans are also in place should exams officers fall ill or be unable to attend.</p>

<p>I have heard from some school and college leaders about the challenges faced in recruiting invigilators this year. JCQ have recently provided <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Guidance-for-centres-managing-exams_June22_v4.pdf" rel="external">guidance for centres managing exams in summer 2022</a>, which includes additional information about invigilation requirements. Recognising the challenges, I’m sure that you have contingency plans in place should invigilators become unavailable at short notice.</p>

<p>Another issue that has come up during my visits to schools and colleges since the start of the year relates to the arrangements for special consideration this year, including about what happens if students are unwell when they are due to take exams. JCQ has recently updated its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/A-guide-to-the-special-consideration-process-202122-%E2%80%93-General-and-Vocational-qualifications-Updated-8-April-2022.pdf" rel="external">guide to the special consideration process</a>, which now includes detailed supplementary guidance for centres in relation to this year’s exams.</p>

<p>While in any year there may be a small number of students who are unable to sit some exams and assessments, I know that schools and colleges will do all that they can to support students to take their examinations this summer. The changes made to the exam timetable, with the spacing out of exams so there are at least 10 days between the first and last exam in a subject, are intended to significantly reduce the risk that students who are due to take their exams are unable to sit all assessments in a qualification.</p>

<p>As we return to students taking exams and formal assessments this year, you may find it helpful to refer to our recently republished ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulating-gcses-as-and-a-levels-guide-for-schools-and-colleges-2022">Guide for Schools and Colleges 2022: GCSE, AS and A levels</a>’ and our ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-centres-awarding-vtqs-in-2021-and-2022">Guidance for centres: awarding VTQs in 2021 and 2022</a>’. The guides bring together information on what schools and colleges can expect from exam boards and awarding organisations and what is expected of you.</p>

<p>We have also recently published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ofqual.blog.gov.uk/2022/05/10/exams-are-starting-2/" rel="external">a short summary, in blog form, which contains some reminders for both schools and colleges and students on how to make sure exams run smoothly</a>. I hope this will serve as a helpful refresher, especially as you may have colleagues, including exams officers, who have not previously experienced a full summer exam series.</p>

<h2>Information for students</h2>

<p>Ofqual has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-guide-to-exams-and-formal-assessments-in-2021-to-2022">student guide</a>, which contains information on the arrangements in place for awarding both GCSE, AS and A levels, and vocational and other qualifications, in 2022. We’d be really grateful if you could point students to it, as well as the other resources we’ve published this year to support them which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-exam-pressure-a-guide-for-students/coping-with-exam-pressure-a-guide-for-students">guide to coping with exam pressure</a>, produced with Professor David Putwain, a researcher (and a former school and college teacher) at Liverpool John Moores University</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ofqual.blog.gov.uk/2022/02/10/what-sorts-of-things-might-help-you-prepare-for-exams/" rel="external">blog by Professor Kevin Woods and Dr Tee McCaldin outlining the sorts of things that might help students to prepare for exams</a>
</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OfqualGovUk/videos" rel="external">videos on our social media channels</a> of tips for students from other students</li>
</ul>

<p>As this will be the first time that many students have taken formal exams, it’s also important that they’re fully aware of the rules that apply in the exam hall— and in particular that students don’t bring in their watches or other prohibited devices such as mobile phones.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>Finally, I’d like to close as I started by offering a heartfelt thank you— to teaching and support staff— for all that you do to make the exam season successful for your students: from the hard work that goes into preparing students, to supporting the effective running of the series in your centres.</p>

<p>I would like to extend my best wishes to each and every student sitting exams and assessments this summer, wishing them every success in their upcoming assessments and with their future plans.</p>

<p>Yours Faithfully,</p>
