<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Before you apply for Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) 2022, you should check all land parcels you intend to include on your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application. If you need to make changes to your land parcels, it is important that you do this as soon as possible so that the most up to date information can be included on your application.</p>

<p>Before applying you should also read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-on-agri-environment-agreements-cs-and-es-and-bps">Guidance on agri-environment agreements (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> and <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) and Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>)</a> (which is mainly focused on existing agreement but includes information about land cover and non-agricultural land which is relevant for all applicants)</li>

</ul>

<h2>What to check on your digital maps before applying</h2>
<p>You should check all land parcels you intend to include on your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service. To do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ruralpayments.service.gov.uk" rel="external">Rural Payments Service</a>
</li>
  <li>From the ‘Business overview’ screen, click ‘View land’ link</li>
  <li>To view individual land parcel details, select the land parcel you need. The ‘Parcel details’ screen shows you a digital map and some land parcel details, for example land cover and total area.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the land parcels being included in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application are registered and linked to your Single Business Identifier (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). This means the land parcels need to show on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service. All agricultural and non-agricultural land parcels which are 0.0100 hectares or above must be registered and linked to your holding (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). Non-agricultural land covers such as buildings and farmyards on which you want to apply for management options or capital items can be mapped as non-agricultural land covers within larger parcels. 
For example:
    <ul>
      <li>Options HS1 or HS8 for maintenance or weatherproof traditional farm buildings</li>
      <li>any capital works in a farmyard, such as those for water and air quality improvements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the permanent land parcel boundaries are shown correctly. This includes the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Hedges you’re intending to use for options BE3 (management of hedgerows)</li>
      <li>BN5 (hedgerow laying)</li>
      <li>BN6 (hedgerow coppicing) in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can view permanent land parcel boundaries on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service. Tick ‘Hedges’ on the relevant map on ‘View land’. For more information read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use"><abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ‘land cover’ is shown correctly. Agricultural and non-agricultural land must have an appropriate land cover.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: land cover is not the same as land use. We classify land by identifying the physical nature of the land. These categories are referred to as land covers. We then look at the activities the land is used for, these sub-categories are referred to as land uses:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Land cover categories</th>
      <th scope="col">Examples of land use</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arable land</td>
      <td>Temporary grassland, fallow land, winter wheat, spring barley</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Permanent grassland</td>
      <td>Permanent grassland</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Permanent crops</td>
      <td>Permanent crops</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Non-agricultural area</td>
      <td>Woodland, farm building, ungrazeable scrub, reedbed</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We only map the land cover, not the land use. For a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application being submitted in 2022, the land cover shown on your digital maps must reflect the land use declared for that land parcel as of 16 May 2022 (the year before the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement starts).</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="#appsandland"><abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> applications and land uses</a> below.</p>

<p>The management required under some <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> options means the land becomes non-agricultural. The land cover for non-agricultural land that is managed (or intended to be managed) under an agri-environment scheme needs to show correctly on your digital maps in the Rural Payments service.</p>

<p>For more information read <a class="govuk-link" href="#regorupdate">Registering or updating land cover</a> below.</p>

<h2>How to update your digital maps</h2>

<h3>Linking a registered land parcel to your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>
</h3>
<p>If a land parcel is already registered in our Rural Payment Service (Land Parcel Identification System (<abbr title="Land Parcel Identification System">LPIS</abbr>)) but is not shown as linked to your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>, you may need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask the previous occupier to transfer it to you. This can be done online using the Rural Payments service if the land parcel shows as 100% owned. If the Holding type shows as ‘Tenant’ or it’s less than 100% owned, it cannot be transferred online. The Change land tenure form can be used to update the land tenure if it’s incorrect. Once RPA have made this change it should then be possible to transfer that land online.</li>
  <li>If it’s not possible to transfer the land online, you should submit an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form to us and ask that it’s added to your holding (<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>). The effective date for transfer must be when the land was legally transferred to you and must be before the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement start date.</li>
  <li>If you wish to maintain a dual link with the existing occupier, use the ‘Add land’ email route. This adds a link between the land parcel and your <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>, but it keeps any existing link between the land parcel and another <abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>. To remove that existing link, an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form should be submitted by the existing occupier.
For more information, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2021-for-electronic-and-paper-use">RLE guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registering a land parcel for the first time</h3>
<p>If a land parcel is not already mapped in our Rural Payments service (<abbr title="Land Parcel Identification System">LPIS</abbr>), you will need to submit an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form and sketch map to request it is mapped for the first time. This may include land that is not eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) such as farmyards.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use"><abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> guidance</a> for more details, in particular ‘Part D: Register a land parcel to your holding’.</p>

<p>The ‘Effective date of change’ on the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form (column D5 in Part D) should be the date that you took legal responsibility for the land parcel. If the date you took responsibility was 1 January 2022 fill in the effective date of change as 31 December 2021 (the day before the agreement start date).</p>

<h3>Updating permanent land parcel boundaries</h3>
<p>To update a permanent land parcel boundary, including adding hedges particularly where you intend to use for BE3 (Management of hedgerows), BN5 (Hedgerow laying) or BN6 (Hedgerow coppicing), submit an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form and sketch map.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use"><abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> guidance</a> for guidance on updating permanent land parcel boundaries and what to include on a sketch map.</p>

<h3>Registering or updating ‘land cover’</h3>
<p>To register or update the land cover, fill in an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form and provide a sketch map.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use"><abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> guidance</a> for more details, in particular ‘Part D: Add a permanent non-agricultural area or feature’ or ‘Change land cover’.</p>

<p>Write ‘Land cover change’ at the top of your sketch map. Clearly label the land parcel with the new land cover (arable, permanent grassland, permanent crops or non-agricultural). If the land cover is non-agricultural, write the relevant land use code to identify the appropriate type of non-agricultural land cover for the land parcel(s). For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>WO12 (woodland)</li>
  <li>WO25 (ungrazeable scrub)</li>
  <li>IW05 (shingle)</li>
  <li>IW07 (bog)</li>
  <li>MW02 (tidal area)</li>
  <li>MW03 (reed bed)</li>
  <li>MW04 (intertidal habitat)</li>
  <li>MW05 (saline habitat)</li>
  <li>CF02 (vegetated shingle)</li>
  <li>CF03 (sand dunes)</li>
</ol>

<p>The table below lists the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> options that typically mean agricultural land is classed as non-agricultural. It also provides some useful non-agricultural land use codes you can use on your sketch map to support an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form to register or update land cover.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Higher Tier, Mid Tier or Wildlife Offer agreements with a start date of 1 January 2023, the ‘Effective date of change’ on the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form (column D5 in Part D) should be 31 December 2022 (the day before the agreement start date).</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Woodland Creation, if the agreement start date will be after the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application deadline (16 May in 2022), the ‘Effective date change’ on the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form should be 1 January 2023. If the agreement start date is before the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application deadline, the ‘Effective date of change’ should be the actual agreement start date.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> applications and land use</h2>
<p>When you include land parcels in a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Higher Tier, Mid Tier or Wildlife Offer application that has been used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> in the same year, we will check that the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> management option applied for is compatible with the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> land use declared for that land parcel. This should be the land use for that land parcel as of 16 May 2022. It is the ‘land use’ declared in the year you apply that we will check for your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application, even though the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement start date is 1 January 2023.</p>

<p>If the land use is changed after 16 May 2022, you do not need to change the land use declaration for your 2022 <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> application but you may need to change the land use for future <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> applications.</p>

<p><abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Wildlife Offers starting 1 January 2023 can only be located on agricultural land declared on the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 application with an arable or permanent grassland use.</p>

<p>For a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Higher Tier, Mid Tier or Wildlife Offer application being submitted in 2022 (with an agreement start date of 1 January 2023), the land cover shown on your digital maps must reflect the land use declared on the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 application. This should be the land cover for that land parcel as of 16 May 2022 (the year before the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> agreement starts on 1 January 2023).</p>

<p>Where the land cover is changed after 16 May 2022, the land cover on your digital maps must also be changed by submitting an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form. If the same land is used to claim <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> payment in 2022, the ‘Effective date of change’ on the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form (column D5 in part D) should be 31 December 2022 (the day before the agreement start date).</p>

<p>When including land parcels in your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application (for a 1 January 2023 start date), you should note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> grassland options can only be located on land declared with a land use of permanent grassland on the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 application (with a corresponding ‘land cover’ shown on your digital maps)</li>
  <li>you can usually only locate <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> arable options on land declared with a land use of temporary grassland or other arable land use (matching the option requirements) on the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 application (with the corresponding arable ‘land cover’ shown on your digital maps).</li>
</ul>

<p>You may need to submit an <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form and sketch map to request the ‘land cover’ is updated to correspond with the land use declared on the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> 2022 application.</p>

<h2>Completing the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form</h2>
<p>The electronic <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form can be completed and emailed to us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a>. Please make sure that your <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form and any associated sketch maps are sent in a separate email to any other documents you need to send us, using the subject heading ‘<abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> Land Change [<abbr title="Single Business Identifier">SBI</abbr>]’.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rural-land-and-entitlements-rle1-guidance-2022-for-electronic-and-paper-use"><abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> guidance</a> about completing the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form. For additional information read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tell-the-rural-payments-agency-about-land-changes-and-entitlement-transfers">‘How to use the electronic <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form’</a>.</p>

<p>Important: make sure you submit the <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> form to the RPA before you submit your <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application. Try to do this do this as early as possible, or at least one month before the <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> application window closes. This will allow RPA to make the requested changes to your digital maps so your application will have the most up to date information.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep a copy of all completed/ submitted <abbr title="Rural Land Entitlement">RLE1</abbr> forms and sketch maps for your records.</p>
