<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The language used is intended to be general and factual and is not meant to cause offence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 1500.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, you can find the contact details of the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British High Commission online</a>. The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>

<p>When someone dies in Uganda and the next of kin is in the UK or abroad, Ugandan authorities normally notify the British High Commission.</p>

<p>The British High Commission will do whatever they can to trace the next of kin as soon as possible and would ask the UK police to pass on the sad news. However, you might also be notified about the death directly by someone else, for example a local friend of the deceased, a doctor, or a Ugandan police officer.</p>

<p>There is no definition of next of kin in Uganda. However, a living partner/spouse/civil partner, a child, a parent, or an adult with sufficient relationship to the deceased (in that order), will be recognized by the authorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Release of information to next of kin</h3>

<p>Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this may be only available to next of kin. Consular officers may be able to obtain this themselves, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. They may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>Inquiries into deaths in Uganda are not public. Access to information concerning a death such as post-mortem reports, toxicology and histopathology results and police reports may be restricted until the Investigating Judge has reviewed the evidence.</p>

<p>The Ugandan authorities will not usually provide this information directly to next of kin, nor to third parties, including to the British High Commission until after the conclusion of the preliminary investigation. The release of any information will usually take several months and in some more complicated instances, years. In some cases in order to have access to the investigation and obtain information from the court files, the next of kin may have to make their request via a lawyer.</p>

<p>If you want to apply for a copy of the post-mortem and police reports or test results, you must apply through a lawyer. Our consular staff can provide lists of English-speaking lawyers throughout Uganda. The release of any information can take many months.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. They may have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, or be able to cover some of the costs.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will usually be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to bring the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors</a> based in the UK.</p>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Uganda you can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uganda-list-of-funeral-directors">list of funeral directors in Uganda online</a>.</p>

<p>Funeral directors in Uganda are equipped to carry out repatriation procedures and will provide the special caskets required. They will also arrange any necessary documentation such as a local civil registry death certificate, a certificate of embalming and a certificate giving permission to transfer the person who died to the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. Sometimes a funeral director can do this for you. You will usually need documents about you and the person who has died, which include information such as full name, date of birth and passport number</p>

<p>You can apply for a death certificate through the funeral director or in person via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nira.go.ug/" rel="external">National Identification and Registration Authority website</a>.</p>

<p>In order to register the death, the funeral director will ask for documents about you and the person who has died, which include information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name of the deceased</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>date and place of birth</li>
  <li>date and place of death</li>
  <li>medical certificate of cause of death</li>
  <li>police report (where applicable)</li>
  <li>passport details</li>
  <li>residential address</li>

<p>If the funeral arrangements are in the UK other information maybe required like the town of final destination. A fee is charged for the death certificate</p>

<p>In Uganda, the cause of death does not appear on the death certificate.</p>

<p>The local authorities will need to be told if the person who died suffered from an infectious condition such as hepatitis or HIV so they can take precautions against infection.</p>

<p>The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. It will be in English.

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Consular death registration</h2>

<p>You do not have to register the death of a British national that occurs overseas with the UK authorities. You can sometimes apply for a consular death registration. This is not mandatory and cannot be used instead of a death certificate from the country where the person died. It is only available in some countries. If you wish to do this, you can find more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-a-death">registering a death</a> and apply online.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>Post-mortems are performed in all cases involving the death of a foreign national. This is regardless of the cause of death.</p>

<p>Post-mortems in Uganda are carried out by forensic doctors / pathologists appointed by the hospital or by the court. During a post-mortem, small tissue samples may be removed and retained for testing, including toxicological studies, at the discretion of the doctor, without consent of next of kin. You will not automatically be told if this happens.</p>

<p>This is done in order to better understand the cause of death and to evaluate any disease or injury that might be present. It can be crucial to establish cause of death in cases where criminal or civil legal procedures may eventuate. Some pathologists charge for the post-mortem examinations. In some instances there can be delays in getting the post mortem results.</p>

<p>The deceased can be buried or cremated in Uganda or returned to the UK before tests on removed organs are completed.</p>

<p>In some cases it may be necessary to have a further autopsy in the UK even though one has been carried out overseas. When repatriation is planned to England or Wales, it is probable that the coroner will wish to hold an inquest. The decision to hold a post-mortem is entirely taken by the Coroner. They will often take into account the next of kin’s views but the Coroner’s decision is final.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Mortuary facilities</h2>
<p>Mortuaries are usually attached to local hospitals, and there are also dedicated state mortuary facilities in the capital city. In private mortuaries, there may be a cost to the next of kin if the person who died is kept there for longer than necessary.</p>

<p>Most mortuaries in Uganda will not be the same standard as those in the UK. The condition of storage facilities varies depending on the area of Uganda where the person has died from. Cold storage facilities are generally available, though sometimes not in more remote areas of Uganda.</p>

<p>Although we will do everything we can do to ensure that the deceased is placed in appropriate storage we cannot guarantee the condition of the body.</p>

<p>It is not normally necessary for the deceased to be identified by the next of kin in Uganda – they can be identified by someone who knew the deceased when they were alive. Identification may also be carried out by means of documentation such as a passport or driving licence or by fingerprints.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who has died will usually need to decide between a local burial, local cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation. Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Local burial</h2>
<p>If you choose to proceed with a local burial in Uganda, you will need to instruct a funeral director or do it privately with the help of family/ friends. The British High Commission in Uganda can provide a list of local and international funeral directors on request.</p>

<p>If the deceased/next of kin do not own land in Uganda where they will bury the deceased your funeral director can apply to the local authorities for permission to bury in the government cemetery. A fee may be charged for this.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances immediate burial or repatriation may not always be possible. For example an autopsy might be performed to ascertain the cause of death</p>

<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on UK coroners and inquests.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Cremation</h2>
<p>If you are thinking of arranging a local cremation, please take advice from your local funeral director. Crematoriums are not located in every region therefore there might be longer waiting times depending on the area where the death occurred.</p>

<p>As local customs and beliefs tend to see more burial than cremation, the facilities for cremation are very basic. Standards are very different from those in the UK.</p>

<p>Normally the repatriation of the ashes will be arranged by your funeral director - for more information about the repatriation requirements please refer to the Repatriation section below. If you wish to transport the ashes to the UK in person you can do so. We advise to check in advance with the airline about specific airline restrictions.
If you live in Uganda you might be able to keep the ashes of your loved one at home or scatter them.</p>

<p>Authorisation to cremate at the Hindu Crematorium is required. The authorisation for the cremation can be issued upon production of a medical certificate of cause of death and there is no objection to the cremation. A fee is payable for using the crematorium.</p>

<p>Please note that if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on UK coroners and inquests.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Repatriation</h2>
<p>If you decide on a repatriation and the person who died is covered by travel insurance, you should immediately contact the insurance company to establish if they are able to cover for the repatriation expenses and make the relevant arrangements. If the insurance company confirms that there is a current policy you should not appoint your own funeral director or be pressurised by local funeral agencies to do so.</p>

<p>The insurance company will normally have a standing agreement with an international funeral director in the UK to arrange repatriations.</p>

<p>If the person who died is not covered by insurance, you will need to appoint a funeral director in Uganda or an international funeral director yourself.</p>

<p>Ugandan funeral directors have links with international funeral directors in the UK and they will work well together to ensure that all the necessary requirements are met in Uganda and in the UK. Funeral directors in Uganda are equipped to carry out repatriation procedures and will provide the special caskets required.</p>

<p>They will also arrange any necessary documentation such as a local death certificate, a certificate of embalming and a certificate giving permission to transfer the remains to the UK.</p>

<p>Local formalities for repatriation normally take 8 to 10 days to complete. In certain circumstances, immediate repatriation may not always be possible. Our consular staff will try to tell you as soon as possible if this is the case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Return of personal belongings</h2>

<p>Personal belongings found on the deceased at the time of death are either handed over to the family if they are present or taken by the police to be handed over to the Court. If the next of kin chooses repatriation, it is advisable to instruct the local funeral director to ship personal belongings together with the deceased, or to collect them in advance.</p>

<p>If there is an investigation, the deceased’s clothing and belongings can be retained as evidence and are not returned until the court case is finished.</p>

<p>Please note, the British High Commission cannot take responsibility for the personal belongings of the person who died</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Steps to take in the UK</h2>

<p>You can find more information on the steps to take in the UK online. This includes information on arranging the funeral, telling the government about the death, UK pensions and benefits, and dealing with the estate of the person who died. There is a step-by-step guide about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">what to do when someone dies</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>British passport cancellation</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a “D1 form”.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">form and instructions on where to send the passport</a> is available online</p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport to do this. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Child deaths</h2>

<p>Police in Uganda will hold a full investigation into any death, other than those of natural causes; there are no separate procedures for deaths involving children.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>Deaths in road traffic accidents</h2>

<p>Police in Uganda will hold an investigation into any road death. There are no separate procedures for deaths involving road traffic accidents.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter</h2>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as a murder or manslaughter a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide support, including by referring you to a specialised organisation. You can find more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/helping-british-people-abroad-murder-and-manslaughter">how the FCDO can help with murder and manslaughter abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You should note that if the deceased is repatriated to parts of the UK a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest. See the section on UK Coroners and inquests below.</p>

<p>If a death is regarded as suspicious, the Police will investigate in full. If a perpetrator is identified, they will be charged by the relevant Public Prosecutor and normally detained until the trial hearing. The time from arrest to trial can be lengthy and in some complicated cases can take several months to years.</p>

<p>We strongly advise next of kin to appoint legal representation in order to be kept fully informed on the investigation and to be advised on steps to take.</p>

<p>In Uganda there are no family liaison police officers allocated to families of foreign nationals while the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>UK coroners and inquests</h2>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner. Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<p>Please note, Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>

<p>You can find more information on Coroners and the Procurator Fiscal in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">FCDO guide on death abroad</a>.</p>
