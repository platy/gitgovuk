<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In November 2020, the Office for Statistics Regulation (<abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/assessment-report-benefit-statistics/" rel="external">published a report</a> assessing the quarterly Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Benefit Statistics publication for compliance with the Code of Practice for Statistics.</p>

<p>This report identified 9 requirements for improvements to be made to this publication in order to maintain National Statistics badging. Subsequent to this report, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have developed plans to address these requirements which have been agreed with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Head of Profession for Statistics.</p>

<p>The requirements can be broken down into those relating to the Benefit Statistics publication and data and strategic requirements around the theme of user engagement.</p>

<p>This document presents actions taken on the requirements as of April 2021, and planned future actions, with those addressing the user engagement aspects presented separately at the end.</p>

<h2>Requirement 1</h2>

<h2>Actions on user engagement</h2>

<h3>Actions taken as of April 2021 (requirement partially met)</h3>

<p>Created an email address for the Benefit Statistics publication, accessible by all members of the team.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have created an email address inbox for the purpose of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> wide user engagement. This email address will be linked to the external publication of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Statistics User Engagement Strategy, to be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>A comprehensive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dwp-statistics-user-engagement-strategy"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Statistics User Engagement Strategy</a> has been published.</p>

<p>Fed into the development of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Statistics User Engagement Strategy, ensuring that the feedback from the <abbr title="Office for Statistics Regulation">OSR</abbr> was incorporated and addressed within the Strategy.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have created a network of User Engagement Champions (reporting to the wider government statistical community with regards to user engagement in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and User Engagement Representatives (assigned to each statistical publication in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and reporting to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> User Engagement Champion). This ensures that both at the wider government level and individual statistical publication level, there is a community dedicated to ensuring user engagement remains a priority. Further, it provides a resource for support and skill sharing with regards to user engagement, to ensure that knowledge gaps do not prevent user engagement progressing both at the departmental and individual statistical publication level.</p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Strategy, the Benefit Statistics publication now has a Statistical Publication Representative for user engagement.</p>

<h3>Future actions to meet user engagement requirement</h3>

<p>Provide the new Benefit Statistics email address as contact detail for future publications, on Stat-Xplore and other platforms as appropriate. Use this to create a mailing list in accordance with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, to notify users of new publications, and promote user engagement efforts in general. The inbox will also be used to answer user queries.</p>

<p>As part of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Strategy, participate in developing the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>-wide survey to go out to the public this year, ensuring that the questions cover areas of development and interest for the publication.</p>

<p>Our Statistical Publication Representative will remain an active member of the User Engagement Champions and Representatives community in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, ensuring that best practice is shared and we continuously seek out opportunities to develop opportunities to more effectively conduct user engagement.</p>

<p>Potential to develop a survey specific to Benefit Statistics with questions around particular development areas, for instance the timeliness vs accuracy trade-off. This would go out to users around summer 2021.</p>

<p>Publish the results of any specific survey or user engagement activity on the statistics collection page.</p>
