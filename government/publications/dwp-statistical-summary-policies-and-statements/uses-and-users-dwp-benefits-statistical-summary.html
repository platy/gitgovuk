<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) publish a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-statistical-summaries">statistical summary</a> document on a 6-monthly basis and related data quarterly. It is used for the release of a wide range of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical summary brings together key National Statistics on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> administered benefits, including <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit combinations. To provide a more complete picture of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> responsibility, statistics on Housing Benefit (administered by local authorities) and Universal Credit are also included in the collection.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits statistics collection publishes data quarterly, on the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Bereavement benefits (<abbr title="Bereavement benefits">BB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance (<abbr title="Carer’s Allowance">CA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit (<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Income Support (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Pension Credit (<abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>State Pension (<abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Widow’s Benefit (<abbr title="Widow’s Benefit">WB</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each February and August, a summary document is also published, containing a high level summary of the latest National Statistics for the benefits listed above, and where relevant messages about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</li>
  <li>Universal Credit (UC)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit combinations</li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside the statistical summary, there are a large number of tables which enable the user to delve in to the detail. These are provided to the user as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> – an online tool that allows the creation and download of customised statistical tables, and data visualisations through interactive charts - there is a  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/online-help/User-Guide.html" rel="external">Stat-Xplore user guide</a> to help users</p>
  </li>
  <li>old <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> datasets via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/Default.asp" rel="external">NOMIS</a>, however these stopped being updated in 2019 – related Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures are available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/Default.asp" rel="external">NOMIS</a>
</li>
  <li>separate detailed tables on Housing Benefit flows, Bereavement Support Payment, Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, Maternity Allowance and State Pension</li>
</ul>

<p>For the rest of this document, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits statistics should be taken to include all the products and tables outlined above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Known Uses of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit statistics</h3>

<p>The summary (and underlying datasets) are used by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing the evidence base for assessing the potential effect of policy options</li>
  <li>monitoring current <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy and evaluating recent changes</li>
  <li>monitoring the effect on the benefit system of the economic cycle</li>
  <li>answering Parliamentary Questions (PQs) and Freedom of Information (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) requests</li>
  <li>forecasting benefit expenditure (in conjunction with expenditure statistics)</li>
  <li>monitoring the performance of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> as they process Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit claims on behalf of the department</li>
  <li>producing other statistical series (for example, Children in Out-of-work Benefit Households, Neighbourhood statistics, Disadvantage Indicators)</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, the internet based publication mechanism for the Summary means that we cannot understand all the varied uses of these numbers. However, through correspondence with stakeholders and use of Google Analytics we do know that the Summary (and underlying datasets) are used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing general information on the benefit system in Great Britain</li>
  <li>measuring government targets relating to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>producing indices of deprivation in England, Wales and Scotland</li>
  <li>improving population estimates, especially at a small area level</li>
  <li>academic research</li>
  <li>policy development and evaluation by local authorities and other welfare and pensions stakeholders and providers</li>
  <li>administration by other government departments such as Department for Education and Ministry of Justice</li>
  <li>for information by devolved governments</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Analysis of users</h2>

<p>We periodically conduct an analysis of the  users of our main benefit statistics through Google Analytics and through monitoring the types of emails we receive from users. There are two ways to access the Benefits data; via the statistical summary and attached data table and via Stat-Xplore.</p>

<h4>Statistical summary</h4>

<p>Some information on users of the statistical summary and other GOV.UK pages we publish on can be found using Google Analytics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>analysis of the Service Provider dimension shows some groups of users are those from other government departments, local authorities and universities</li>
  <li>analysis of the Source dimension shows that as well as entering the summary from a search engine or directly through typing the web address, users also enter from Facebook, Stat-Xplore and Civil Service Jobs</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stat-Xplore</h4>

<p>We are not currently able to see which users are accessing which datasets on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> but we are happy to hear from users about their experience of Stat-Xplore.</p>

<p>The team responsible for Stat-Xplore are developing methods to analyse the Stat-Xplore user logs in order to understand more about users’ behavourial patterns, while maintaining high standards of security and privacy. This process is early in the development phase but we anticipate when it is completed we will have access to more information about the users of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit statistics data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Valid Uses of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical summary</h3>

<p>The summary can be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtaining the definitive numbers of people claiming <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits</li>
  <li>exploring the characteristics of those claiming benefits</li>
  <li>evaluating <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes and benefits. However, users should be aware that administrative changes in the benefit system can and do affect the published numbers. Therefore, users should read footnotes carefully.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the numbers should not be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/product.asp?vlnk=1944" rel="external">statistics on unemployment</a> – here are a number of measures of unemployment, all of which are published by the Office for National Statistics. However, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistics can provide additional details and context to support the main labour market statistics</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/series/benefit-expenditure-tables">calculation of expenditure on benefits</a> (by multiplication of caseloads and averages)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Areas of unmet user need</h3>

<p>Customers (both within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and externally) sometimes request the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more timely release of statistics. National Statistics are released around 6 months after the reference period. This is to allow for late notification of claims and processing time. This is called retrospection.</li>
  <li>statistics relating to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> process. For example, sometimes information on the number of changes of circumstances is requested. There is no readily available quality assured dataset regarding <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> administrative processing</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> How to comment and get involved</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would like to hear your views on our statistical publications.
