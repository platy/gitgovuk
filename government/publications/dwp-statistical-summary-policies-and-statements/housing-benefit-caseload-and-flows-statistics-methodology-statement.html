<p>The main purpose of this document is to provide users with information about the methods used to produce the Housing Benefit caseload and flows statistics, in accordance with practices set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Housing Benefit statistics form part of the Department of Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-statistical-summaries">benefits statistics collection</a>, which brings together summary National and Official statistics for a range of different benefits.</p>

<p>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) provides people with help in paying their rents if they are unemployed, on a low income or in receipt of another qualifying income related benefit. <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is being replaced by Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) for Working Age claimants, and the number of people claiming <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> has been gradually decreasing and will continue to fall.
<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is different to other <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits because it is administered by Local Authorities on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Responsibility for producing <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics sits with two teams who work closely together within <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Digital Data and Analytics.</p>

<p>The Data Delivery Team collate Housing Benefit data returns from Local Authorities to produce a single data file called the Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>). This extract contains administrative data derived from Local Authority computer systems. Local Authorities return data to <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> once a month. Because they return extracts at different times during the month, there is no common time stamp on the extract.</p>

<p>The Client Statistics Team will combine data from two consecutive <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extracts to produce a <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload dataset; representing the number of live <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims on a given date (the second Thursday of the month). This dataset will then be used to create <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload statistics for a particular month.</p>

<p>By further combining 2 <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload datasets, we can also provide information about any claims ending and new claims starting in the intervening time period between two <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> scans. We call these statistics <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Flows.</p>

<h2>Housing Benefit caseload statistics</h2>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<h4>Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> dataset is the primary source used to create <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics. It contains data about all <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and Council Tax Benefit claims, and is collated from returns from administering Local Authorities. Local Authorities use a range of software suppliers to provide the systems to administer <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and to provide data to <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Data are collected using a well-defined set of specifications which helps to ensure both consistency and quality.
The data returns are monthly and cover a range of different characteristics about the status of each claim, the personal characteristics of claimants, payable amounts and any deductions that may have been made. The data also provides information about which Local Authority is administering each claim.</p>

<h4>Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>) is a system used by <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to collect information about customers. It provides the latest customer information including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details such as date of birth, gender and geographic information</li>
  <li>benefit awards</li>
  <li>preferred method of contact</li>
</ul>

<p>We use two different data feeds from <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> in the production of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload statistics. Firstly, we use an address history file to provide residential based geographic information. Secondly, we use date of birth and gender fields from a weekly view <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> data to verify the age and gender data supplied from the <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extract.</p>

<h3>How we process data</h3>

<p>All of the data sources we access are held securely in a UNIX environment, and only analysts with specific permissions may gain access to it. The data we access have a lot of personal details removed, and are provided in a ‘Masked’ format to protect claimant identities. Personal identifiers such as National Insurance Numbers are encrypted as a security measure.</p>

<p>We use a statistical software package called SAS Enterprise Guide to combine and manipulate data following a process of well-defined rules. SAS coding programs are set up as a process flow to take raw data and turn them into publishable statistics.</p>

<h3>Creating a liveload</h3>

<p>We use 2 consecutive <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extracts in combination to create a caseload snapshot of live cases at the second Thursday of the month (the count date). We use a combination the claim status field with claim start dates and claim end dates to determine which claims are live at that time point. We use data from two extracts so that we can gain information from the second scan on any cases who may have closed or recently opened on or before the count date.</p>

<p>The key points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we can only use records with a valid National Insurance number and identifiable start dates (missing values are filtered out at the beginning)</li>
  <li>processing takes account of the fact that some Local Authorities return data before the count date and some data are returned after the count date</li>
  <li>we include data on closed claims to give us visibility of any short term claims which were live on the count date</li>
  <li>when removing duplication from the data to arrive at 1 row per claimant, live records are retained in preference to closed records, and we keep the observation closest to the count date</li>
  <li>only claims with an award greater than 50p are included in our statistics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dealing with data quality issues</h3>

<p><abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> data is sometimes prone to known data quality issues where information supplied by Local Authorities may be incomplete or missing for a given month. After we create an initial liveload, we apply threshold based quality checks to determine where issues in Local Authority level data may present. If data returned by a Local Authority fall outside acceptable thresholds, we make a determination about whether they should be replaced. If we need to replace data from a Local Authority, we will bring forward the caseload data from the previous month to represent the best available evidence for the current month being reported. This is a process known as “substitution”. Where substitutions occur we maintain a count of how often data are substituted for each Local Authority so that any emerging or persistent quality issues can be fed back and kept in view.</p>

<h3>Adding data from Customer Information System and correcting timing issues</h3>

<p>Once a liveload has been determined and quality issues dealt with, further programs are used to verify dates of birth and gender information from <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> against the latest data held on the <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>. We can then apply additional variables such as a State Pension Age for each individual associated with a claim. From there, we can determine whether claims are “Working Age” or “Pension Age” using rules agreed with Policy colleagues.</p>

<p>Coding rules will address other timing issues in the data, such as correcting any <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> reduction amounts where we find a claim may no longer meet the criteria on the count date. SAS codes will also apply appropriate data formats to the data in preparation for its publication.</p>

<p>A final SAS program will add on geographic information to the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload dataset. This consists of 2 different types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Administration Based Geographies</li>
  <li>Residential Based Geographies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Administration Based Geographies</h3>

<p>This describes which Local Authority is administering each claim.</p>

<h3>Residential Based Geographies</h3>

<p>This describes where claimants are living. This information is derived from the <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> Address History File, which allows us to add on the Census Output Area associated with the residential address. From that, we can determine a full geographic hierarchy using the National Statistics Postcode Lookup file (<abbr title="National Statistics Postcode Lookup file">NSPL</abbr>).</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload dataset has been produced, we perform a series of quality checks before creating a summarised file for uploading onto the Stat-xplore tool. Please see below.</p>

<h2>Housing Benefit flows statistics</h2>

<p>To supplement <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload statistics, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> flows datasets provide counts of new Housing Benefit claims starting, and the number of claims ending.</p>

<p>As described above, the count date for published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload data is always the second Thursday of any given month.</p>

<p>Housing Benefit flows are created by comparing 2 <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload datasets which are set one month apart. We determine which claims are “live” only at the count date for Month 1 and which claims are “live” only at the count date for Month 2.</p>

<p>An off-flow is defined as the end of an existing Housing Benefit claim. An off-flow is identified where a claim appears on the previous month’s Housing Benefit data and is not present on subsequent month’s data, for example May 2020 off-flow figure is calculated by counting claimants that are shown as live on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload data in April 2020 and who do not appear on the corresponding data for May.</p>

<p>An on-flow is defined as the start of a new Housing Benefit claim. An on-flow is identified where a claim appears data for the later month and is not present on the first month’s data, for example May 2020 on-flow figure is calculated by counting claimants that are shown as live on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload data in May 2020 and who do not appear on the corresponding data for April.</p>

<h2>How are the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload and flows data different?</h2>

<p>The presence-based methodology for creating flows uses two separate <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload datasets. In the initial stage, only the National Insurance Number for ‘lead’ claimant is used to a create a dataset showing the on-flowing and off-flowing cases.</p>

<p>The caseload characteristics are then merged on from the relevant month’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload dataset.</p>

<ul>
  <li>off-flows take caseload characteristics from Month 1, as they do not appear as a live case in Month 2</li>
  <li>on-flows take caseload characteristics from Month 2, as the claims were not live in Month 1</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this feature, there are natural timing differences that appear between caseload characteristics for on-flows and off-flows.</p>

<p>Additionally, quality checks have shown that off-flowing claims from Month 1 are more likely to have missing payment amounts than cases who remain on the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload into Month 2.</p>

<p>At the highest level, changes in <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload can be reconciled using the number of on-flows and off-flows. However, when looking at specific characteristics, this is no longer possible as variations in caseload characteristics between two months may be driven by other events that are not captured by our flows methodology. For instance, if a claimant reaches State Pension Age, and moves from Working Age to Pension Age, then in practice their claim would not close and never present as a flow. Meanwhile, the client type volumes will have changed slightly as a result.</p>

<h2>Designation of statistics</h2>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload statistics have been designated National Statistics status, which means they have been prepared in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">UK Statistics Authority Code of Practice for Official Statistics</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Flows statistics have been designation as Experimental Official Statistics.</p>

<p>Labelling the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Flows figures as experimental is consistent with UK Statistical Authority guidance on new statistical outputs. It helps to identify the figures as new and demonstrates that we are open to feedback on their usefulness. Find more information and guidance on the use of experimental statistics on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics" rel="external">Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) website</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback on the usefulness of the flows statistics, then we would be pleased to receive this using the following email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:stats-consultation@dwp.gov.uk">stats-consultation@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Quality statement</h2>

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) is committed to producing accurate, timely, high quality official statistics publications that take into account user needs and which are produced and disseminated in accordance with the UK Statistics Authority’s (UKSA) Code of Practice. The 3 pillars of the Code of Practice are trustworthiness, quality and value. The quality pillar of is further split into these areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>suitable data sources</li>
  <li>sound methods</li>
  <li>assured quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Read about our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-statistical-summary-policies-and-statements/quality-statement-dwp-benefits-statistical-summary#suitable-data-sources">wider approach to quality for the <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits statistics release</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Caseload and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Flows statistics methodologies cover a range of quality assurance activities to provide assurance across the 3 areas, these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when we receive data from suppliers, we routinely check the quality statements and assurances that are supplied with the monthly <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> data. We gain an appreciation of any data gaps or where a Local Authority has not returned any data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we run quality checks on the data supplied to identify any potential cases that may be incorrectly removed by our methodology</p>
  </li>
  <li>as we move through the caseload creation, we create counts to check assumptions and methods are working correctly</li>
  <li>we use data from other sources to improve the quality of our breakdowns for age, gender and geography</li>
  <li>
    <p>before data are moved onto Stat-xplore, we perform a thorough check of the statistics to check for anomalies, outliers and the impacts of any missing data</p>
  </li>
  <li>issues are recorded onto a quality log and rated according their impact. Any issues that are detrimental to the quality of our published statistics are communicated to users</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible we use a standardised framework for the dissemination of statistics on Stat-xplore so that the data we provide can be compared across multiple time periods and across different benefits. For instance, residential geographies across all of <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit statistics are underpinned by the same geographical reference file (National Statistics Postcode Lookup).</p>

<p>We check and review our methodologies regularly against any policy changes that may impact the meaning and interpretation of data. The rules we follow to create the variable groupings such as Client Type are continually reviewed. We receive <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> Policy circulars and engage purposefully with wider analytical and policy stakeholder groups to consider changes either the Housing Benefit policy, the source data we receive and to pre-empt changing user needs.</p>

<p>On the Stat-xplore dissemination tool, against each available variable, users can find background information and a quality statement to make them aware of any issues that may impact its quality.</p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<p>Data may sometimes be supplied with missing start dates for a section of newer claims. We monitor how many cases are impacted, and where a start date is missing we use a proxy variable called the “Treat as Made” date, which represents the date at which we can treat a decision to award <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> as having been taken.</p>

<p>On rare occasions, a Local Authority may fail to supply any data for a given month. Where this happens, we have a process known as substitution that effectively uses the best available evidence in order to allow us to create reliable counts for the whole of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Some timing issues can occur when there is a time lag between the data return date and the count date used for publication. As noted elsewhere, some recoding of information takes place where this timing difference may account for changes to the status of a claim, its categorisation or in consideration of any award reductions.</p>

<p>As highlighted earlier, cases identified as off-flows are more likely to have missing payment information.</p>

<h2>Pre-publication and release</h2>

<p>As noted earlier, <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics are released as part of a wider publication called <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Benefit Statistics. Commentary about <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics can be found in the Bi-Annual Statistical Summary that forms part of this collection.</p>
