<p>This page gives explanation behind the background and methodology used to derive the Benefit Combination statistics.</p>

<p>These statistics are published quarterly on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Background</h2>

<p>The aim of the Benefit Combination statistics is to provide a count of the number of individuals claiming a <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit in total (i.e. only counting each individual claimant once). They are also to show the key combinations of benefits claimed.</p>

<p>These statistics should only be used for looking at the whole, combined picture for <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit claimants. For more complete and detailed data on individual benefits, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/statistics">individual publications for separate benefits</a>.</p>

<p>The Benefit Combination statistics cover the following <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> paid or administered benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Bereavement Benefit (<abbr title="Bereavement Benefit">BB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Bereavement Support Payment (<abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance (<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit (<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Income Support (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Pension Credit (<abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>State Pension (<abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Widow’s Benefit (<abbr title="Widow's Benefit">WB</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>For household level benefits (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, <abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>), both the main claimant and partner (if applicable) are included in the statistics as separate individuals. This differs from publication elsewhere of <abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics where figures show number of claims regardless of whether for a single person or a couple. An individual is not counted as a benefit claimant if they are a beneficiary of another person’s benefit claim but are not claiming any benefit in their own right.</p>

<p><abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> administered benefits such as Tax Credits and Child Benefit are NOT included in the statistics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Definitions</h2>

<p>In the Benefit Combination statistics, some terms are defined differently than in the individual published statistics for specific benefits, and some benefits are grouped together:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Claimant</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit claimant is defined for the purposes of these statistics as the individual who is claiming benefit on their own behalf, or in the case of Universal Credit, Pension Credit and Housing Benefit, an individual who is part of a single or couple claim for benefit. An individual is not counted as a benefit claimant if they are a beneficiary of another person’s benefit claim but are not claiming any benefit in their own right.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Reference date</h3>

<p>These statistics represent the situation at a point in time, called the reference date. The reference date is given as a specific month but due to variation across the systems and methodologies within the data sources for different benefits, the point within a given month does vary across benefits. For almost all benefits, the reference date used is the last day of the month. However, for Housing Benefit (<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>) and Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) the date that is used is the 2nd Thursday of the month. Thus in a small number of cases, benefit combinations will reflect different claim start and end dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for example, if an individual starts new claims for both <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> after the 2nd Thursday of a month, the <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> data with reference date at the end of the month will show the individual to be claiming <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> in that month, but the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data with reference date 2nd Thursday will not show the individual to be claiming in that month</li>
  <li>alternatively, if an individual stops claiming both <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> after the 2nd Thursday of a month, the <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> data with reference date at the end of the month will not show the individual to be claiming <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> in that month, but the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data with reference date 2nd Thursday will show the individual to be claiming in that month</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Caseload</h3>

<p>Number of individuals on the benefit caseload at the reference date. For most benefits, figures show the number of people in receipt of payment. Some benefits however also include those with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital. Benefits where both entitlement and allowance are included are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance (<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>some Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>) cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> <abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises PIP, DLA and AA for help with some of the extra costs caused by long-term disability, ill-health or terminal ill-health">PIP/DLA/AA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) is a benefit for people who became disabled before they reached state pension age and who need assistance with personal care or mobility. From 8 April 2013 <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> started to replace <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> for working age people with Personal Independence Payment (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>), and all new claims are now made to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> rather than <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, while existing <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claimants aged less than 65 on 8 April 2013 are gradually being invited to switch to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. However, people can continue to receive <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> or <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> after reaching state pension age if they continue to satisfy the entitlement conditions.</p>

<p>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>) is a benefit for people at state pension age or over who are so severely disabled that they need a great deal of help with personal care or supervision. Essentially these three benefits each offer help for similar sets of circumstances, although under slightly different qualifying conditions. As such they have been banded together and the benefit combinations statistics simply show <abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises PIP and DLA for help with some of the extra costs caused by long-term disability, ill-health or terminal ill-health">PIP/DLA</abbr> for Working Age individuals, or <abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises PIP, DLA and AA for help with some of the extra costs caused by long-term disability, ill-health or terminal ill-health">PIP/DLA/AA</abbr> for State Pension Age individuals, where the individual could be on any of the benefits shown at the reference date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> <abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises ESA, IB and SDA (and IS where IB is claimed at the same time), to help with living costs if a claimant is unable to work due to a disability or health condition">INCAP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Benefit Combination statistics refer to <abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises ESA, IB and SDA (and IS where IB is claimed at the same time), to help with living costs if a claimant is unable to work due to a disability or health condition">INCAP</abbr> which is short hand for <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>/<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>/<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>/<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>(<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>). Incapacity Benefit (<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>), Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>) (for those under <abbr title="State Pension age">SPA</abbr>), and Income Support for those claiming on the basis of incapacity (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>(<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>)) closed to new claimants from 2008, with existing claimants migrated to Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) on a rolling program since that date. Migration is not yet fully completed. Essentially these four benefits each offer help for similar sets of circumstances, although under slightly different qualifying conditions. As such they have been banded together and the benefit combinations statistics simply show <abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises ESA, IB and SDA (and IS where IB is claimed at the same time), to help with living costs if a claimant is unable to work due to a disability or health condition">INCAP</abbr>, where at the reference date the individual could be on any of <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>; <abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> (separately or in combination); and <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr> where <abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> is also in payment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>As with the published <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data, <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> refers to those who claim one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</li>
  <li>Reduced Earnings Allowance</li>
  <li>Retirement Allowance</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Income Support for those claiming on the basis of incapacity (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>(<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>)) closed to new claimants from 2008, with existing claimants migrated to Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) on a rolling program since that date. Migration is not yet fully completed. Benefit Combination statistics include <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>(<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>) cases in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#incap-1"><abbr title="a group of benefits which comprises ESA, IB and SDA (and IS where IB is claimed at the same time), to help with living costs if a claimant is unable to work due to a disability or health condition">INCAP</abbr> category</a>. Those claiming Income Support on the basis of something other than incapacity (for example carers, lone parents) are shown as <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr> within these statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Universal Credit was introduced in April 2013 in certain pathfinder areas of North West England. Since October 2013, it has progressively been rolled out to other areas. It is now available in all Jobcentre Plus areas to single claimants, and is being expanded across the country to include all claimant types. The following benefits will be replaced as Universal Credit rolls out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>An individual claiming Universal Credit may have to do work-related activity in order to get full entitlement to Universal Credit. Each eligible adult will fall into one of six conditionality regimes based on their capability and circumstances. The benefit combination statistics band together certain conditionality regimes and present <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claims as belonging to one of four categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Out-of-work</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> No Work Requirements</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Working</li>
  <li>and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> unknown</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Out-of-work comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>searching for work (Not working, or with very low earnings. Claimant is required to take action to secure work - or more / better paid work. The Work Coach supports them to plan their work search and preparation activity)</li>
  <li>planning for work (Expected to work in the future. Lone parent / lead carer of child aged 1 (or aged 1-2 prior to April 2017). Claimant required to attend periodic interviews to plan for their return to work)</li>
  <li>preparing for work (Expected to start preparing for future even with limited capability for work at the present time or a child aged 2 (or aged 3-4 prior to April 2017), the claimant is expected to take reasonable steps to prepare for work including Work Focused Interview)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> No Work Requirements comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who are not expected to work at present, such as those for whom Health or caring responsibility prevents claimant from working or preparing for work</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Working comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>working – with requirements (In work but could earn more, or not working but has a partner with low earnings)</li>
  <li>working – no requirements (Individual or household earnings over the level at which conditionality applies. Required to inform <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of changes of circumstances, particularly if at risk of decreasing earnings or losing job)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Unknown comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those where conditionality is not recorded on the source systems or is not available prior to April 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Figures in this, and future <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> publications, are affected by the introduction of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>). The main changes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increasing number of individuals claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> with corresponding decreasing number of individuals claiming <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>
</li>
  <li>increasing number of individuals claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> who would previously have claimed Working Tax Credit and/or Child Tax Credit and who would not have appeared in these statistics until their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claim began</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> Benefit Combinations</h3>

<p>The combinations of benefits that an individual can claim are many and varied. There are too many to usefully list them all in a single variable, although the fields for separate benefits on Stat-Xplore can be used to find any specific combination if required. Instead, three fields have been created to show the most common combinations that occur for each of three separate groupings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Out of Work</li>
  <li>State Pension Age</li>
  <li>Working Age</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, the categories of these fields are mutually exclusive and therefore can be summed without double counting.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span> Benefit Combination (Out of Work)</h3>

<p>The Out of Work benefit combinations cover 100% of claimants for a specific list of out-of-work benefits. This measure enables users to bridge the gap between previously published Working Age Client Group NOMIS data and the benefit combination statistics in Stat-Xplore. For the purposes of this field, out-of-work benefits are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Incapacity Benefit (<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Income Support (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>) where Carer’s Allowance (<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>) not also in payment</li>
  <li>Pension Credit (<abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr>) where Carer’s Allowance (<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>) not also in payment</li>
  <li>Universal Credit Out of Work (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> OOW) where conditionality regime is one of Searching for Work, Preparing for Work or Planning for Work.</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Explanation of key differences</h2>

<p>This section covers key differences between the caseloads that can be obtained through the Benefit Combination statistics and the published caseloads.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Methodological differences – <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The published <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics do not remove duplicate cases by <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>, but by Warehouse ID (<abbr title="Warehouse ID">WH_PIP_ID</abbr>). Administrative complications have led to a very small number of cases where the same <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> is attached to more than one <abbr title="Warehouse ID">WH_PIP_ID</abbr>. However, in order for the sorting and merging step 2 to work correctly we must first remove any duplicate records by <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> during step 1. This means that the benefit combination statistics show slightly fewer people claiming <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> at a given point in time than the official <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> statistics.</p>

<p>However, the difference is insignificant – as at May 2020, there were 1,300 fewer cases in the combined benefit dataset than the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> dataset, which is 0.05% of the <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> caseload.</p>

<p>Child Disability Payment is the first of the application-based disability benefits to be introduced by the Scottish Government. It replaces Disability Living Allowance for children living in Scotland. From July 2021, new applications were taken in Scotland for Child Disability Payment for children under 16 that live in the pilot areas of Dundee City, Na h-Eileanan Siar and Perth and Kinross. On 22 November 2021, Child Disability Payment launched nationwide to all new applicants living in Scotland.</p>

<p>The Disability Living Allowance figures presented to the end of August 2021 overlaps with the launch of Child Disability Payment in the pilot areas in Scotland detailed above. This overlap accounts for approximately five weeks where new applications for Child Disability Payment in these areas were taken. Data on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/about/statistics/social-security-scotland-statistics-publications" rel="external">applications and payments</a> made for this time period is available. Due to the short time period and limited areas that applicants could apply from, the number of applications received were small and have had a very limited impact on Disability Living Allowance for child numbers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Methodological differences – <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics give the number of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims at a point in time. Claims may be for individual (single) people or for couples, and the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> publication dataset contains one row per claim with the <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> of the main claimant but also gives the <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> of the partner (if there is one) in a separate field.</p>

<p>In order to create a dataset with one row per individual (for all individuals in the claim whether they are the main claimant or the partner), during step 1 every row with the partner <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> populated is copied and appended back on to the dataset with the <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> field populated by the partner <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is possible to get a figure for number of individuals from the published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics by looking at the ‘gender’ variable, where the gender for the claim is recorded as male/female for single claims and ‘couple’ for couple claims. However, there are some discrepancies in the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> dataset between the gender variable and whether the partner <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> is populated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>in May 2020, 1,700 cases were recorded as a couple according to the ‘gender’ classification but had no partner <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>, and 0 male and 1 female individuals were recorded as single claims but did have a partner <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> recorded</li>
</ul>

<p>Published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> figures also allow an individual to be in more than one claim at the same point in time, and counts each as a separate claim. The benefit combinations dataset removes duplicates since the dataset counts each individual once and records whether they are on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> or not at the caseload date.</p>

<ul>
  <li>in May 2020, there were 2,000 duplicate <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> records removed from the benefit combinations individual dataset</li>
  <li>note that these issues interact with one another, as some of the duplicates being removed are individuals who appear as the main claimant on one record and the partner on another. The difference is therefore smaller than 1,700+2,000 (=3,700)</li>
</ul>

<p>Further differences between published <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics and Benefit Combinations <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> figures are caused by cleaning rules for some overlapping <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claims, which are explained in section 4.5.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Methodological differences – <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Benefit Combinations <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> caseload estimates the caseload of individuals who were claiming Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (as defined in section 2.6) as at the last day of the calendar month. The source <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data (from the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit system 100% data) used for Benefit Combination statistics shows <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> claimants at a point five months previous to the last day of the Benefit Combinations calendar month.  To adjust for this lag, data from the Customer Information System (<abbr title="Centralised information System">CIS</abbr>) showing deaths has been used to be remove cases for individuals known to have died between the <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> time point and the Benefit Combinations time point.</p>

<p>The published <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> caseload for March 2020 was 265,000.  For February 2020, the Benefit Combinations <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> caseload (estimated using the latest published <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> caseload at the time (from September 2019) minus those who were known to have died) was 264,000, which represents a 0.4% undercount (1,100 fewer people) of the March 2020 caseload.</p>

<p>Please note that as this method does not account for people who leave <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> for any reason other than death or for those who join the caseload within the period, results in the estimate consistently undercount the published <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> figures (corresponding the one month later) by 0.1% to 1.1%.  Note further that these estimates, while imperfect, are consistently closer to the <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> caseload at the time of publishing than if the most recently available <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data were used when publishing the Benefit Combinations.</p>

<p>Also note that no <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data was published in June 2015 due to a data processing deficiency.  Accordingly, the March 2015 <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data was used when estimating both the August 2015 and November 2015 Benefit Combinations <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> caseloads.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Age and Gender</h3>

<p>In most existing published data series for individual benefits, the age and gender are published as recorded on the source system for that benefit. However, the combined benefit dataset uses the Customer Information System (<abbr title="Centralised information System">CIS</abbr>) record for each <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr> to bring through gender and date of birth.</p>

<p>In a small proportion of cases, a <abbr title="Centralised information System">CIS</abbr> record cannot be found. (For May 2020, 0.03% of records overall, with most benefits less than 0.01%, <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>/<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>/IIBD between 0.01% and 0.05%, and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> 0.11%). Where this occurs, a hierarchy is applied to populate the date of birth and gender with that recorded on the source benefit dataset as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if <abbr title="Centralised information System">CIS</abbr> not found, use <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>then <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>then the combined National Statistics dataset for all of <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>/<abbr title="Bereavement Benefit">BB</abbr>/<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>/<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>/<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>/<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>/<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>/<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>/<abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr>/<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>/<abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>/<abbr title="Widow's Benefit">WB</abbr>
</li>
  <li>then <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>then <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>
</li>
  <li>then <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This hierarchy still leaves a tiny proportion of cases where date of birth and gender are not known – these tend to be individuals claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are differences between the gender and date of birth as recorded on <abbr title="Centralised information System">CIS</abbr>, compared to that recorded on the individual benefit systems. For May 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ages differ by less than 0.2% for any benefit individually, ranging between 0.04% or less for most benefits and 0.14% for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>genders differ less than ages – the highest difference is for <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> at 0.03%</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also differences in the time points that difference benefits use to calculate the age at caseload based on date of birth:</p>

<ul>
  <li>legacy benefit (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>/<abbr title="Bereavement Benefit">BB</abbr>/<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>/<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>/<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>/<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>/<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>/<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>/<abbr title="Pension Credit">PC</abbr>/<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>/<abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr>/<abbr title="Widow's Benefit">WB</abbr>) and <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data calculates age as at the end of the caseload month</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> calculates age as at the start of the caseload month</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> calculate age as at the 2nd Thursday of the month</li>
</ul>

<p>The combined benefit dataset calculates age as at the end of the caseload month in order to maximise the number of benefits for which the methodology is the same, but this means that there are slight differences across age bands for <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr>, <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Cleaning</h3>

<p>Under some circumstances (such as administrative transitions between different systems, or differences in reference date across different sources) an individual appears in the raw data to be claiming a combination of benefits that should not be possible – for example Universal Credit and <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>. Cleaning rules are therefore applied to ensure that the published figures do not contain these “illegal combinations”.</p>

<p>The rules that are applied are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the person appears to be on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> then we do not allow them to also be on any of <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>, <abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>, <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> so any markers for these 3 benefits are set to blank</li>
  <li>if a person appears to be on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> then we check to see if the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claim is ongoing for more than 14 days beyond the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload date, and if not then the <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> marker is set to blank</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of cases affected by this cleaning is small and accounts for no more than 1% of the total caseload for each affected benefit or group of benefits. For the caseload at August 2021, the number of cases cleaned is shown in the following table.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Scottish Devolution</h2>

<p>The Scotland Act 2016 gives Scottish Parliament powers over a number of social security benefits which had been administered to Scottish claimants by the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>).  The benefits affected are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carer’s Allowance (<abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Personal Independence Payments (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In September 2018, <abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr> became the first of these benefits to have executive competency transferred from <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to Scottish Ministers.  On 1 April 2020, executive competence transferred to the Scottish Government for all remaining disability and industrial injuries benefits due to be devolved. While Social Security Scotland is building its delivery capacity, <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is administering these benefits on behalf of the Scottish Ministers for an interim period under agency agreements. The Scottish Government release summary statistics for <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>, <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, <abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr> and <abbr title="Carer's Allowance">CA</abbr> in Scotland, consistent with <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> figures.</p>

<p>Child Disability Payment is the first of the application-based disability benefits to be introduced by the Scottish Government. It replaces <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> for children living in Scotland. From July 2021, new applications were taken in Scotland for Child Disability Payment for children under 16 that live in the pilot areas of Dundee City, Na h-Eileanan Siar and Perth and Kinross. On 22 November 2021, Child Disability Payment launched nationwide to all new applicants living in Scotland.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> figures presented to the end of August 2021 overlap with the launch of Child Disability Payment in the pilot areas in Scotland detailed above. This overlap accounts for approximately five weeks where new applications for Child Disability Payment in these areas were taken. Data on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/about/statistics/social-security-scotland-statistics-publications" rel="external">applications and payments</a> made for this time period are available. Due to the short time period and limited areas that applicants could apply from, the number of applications received were small and have had a very limited impact on <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> for child numbers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Benefit Combinations visuals</h2>

<p>The Benefit Combinations section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-statistical-summaries">Benefit Statistical Summary release</a> contains illustrative diagrams known as Euler diagrams, included to demonstrate the complexity of the situation for many claimants.</p>

<p>An Euler (pronounced OY-lər) diagram is a means of representing sets and their relationships. They typically involve overlapping shapes, and may be scaled, such that the area of the shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains. They are particularly useful for explaining complex hierarchies and overlapping definitions. They are often confused with Venn diagrams. Unlike Venn diagrams, which show all possible relations between different sets, the Euler diagram shows only relevant relationships.</p>

<p>The Euler diagrams for the Benefit Combinations statistics are created using software which sizes and positions overlapping circles to represent the areas of each overlapping section as accurately as possible. However, it is not possible to represent every single combination that occurs in the data in a 2 dimensional diagram of overlapping circles, and it is not always possible for the areas to be exactly proportional to the number of cases for each combination.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Status of the statistics</h2>

<p>These statistics are badged as experimental. This means that the statistics have been developed using guidelines set out by the UK Statistics Authority, and as official statistics undergoing evaluation they have accordingly been badged as Experimental Statistics. Users are invited to comment on the development and relevancy of these statistics at this stage. As the data available evolves over time, the methodology used and definitions may develop also. Users of these statistics are asked to note the status as experimental official statistics and that subsequent releases may include revisions to the time series already released.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Disclosure control</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics (CoP)</a>, specifically <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/trustworthiness/t6-data-governance/" rel="external">Principle T6: Data Governance</a> set out principles for how we protect data on individuals from being disclosed.</p>

<h3>Introduced Random Error</h3>

<p>Figures in this publication are derived from Stat-Xplore and are subject to Introduced Random Error. This is to ensure that no data is released which could risk the identification of individuals.</p>

<p>Many classifications used within Benefit Combinations statistics have an uneven distribution of data throughout their categories, in particular across geographical areas. When geographical area is cross-tabulated with other breakdowns, such as age, gender and family type, the number in the table cell could be small. These small numbers increase the risk of identifying individuals in the statistics.</p>

<p>Even when variables are more evenly distributed in the classifications, the problem still occurs. The more detailed the classifications, and the more of them that are applied in constructing a table, the greater the incidence of very small cells.</p>

<p>Care is taken in the specification of tables to minimise the risk of identifying individuals. In addition, a technique has been developed to randomly adjust cell values. Random adjustment of the data is considered to be the most satisfactory technique for avoiding the release of identifiable data. When the technique is applied, all cells may be slightly adjusted to prevent any identifiable data being exposed. These adjustments result in small introduced random errors. However, the information value of the table as a whole is not impaired. The technique allows very large tables, for which there is a strong customer demand, to be produced even though they contain numbers of very small cells.</p>

<p>It is not possible to determine which individual figures have been affected by random error adjustments, but the small variance which may be associated with derived totals can, for the most part, be ignored.</p>

<p>No reliance should be placed on small cells as they are impacted by random adjustment, respondent and processing errors.</p>

<p>Many different classifications are used in Benefit Combinations statistics tables and the tables are produced for a variety of geographical areas. The effect of the introduced random error is minimised if the statistic required is found direct from a tabulation rather than from aggregating more finely classified data.</p>

<p>Similarly, rather than aggregating data from small areas to obtain statistics about a larger standard geographic area, published data for the larger area should be used wherever possible.</p>

<p>When calculating proportions, percentages or ratios from cross-classified or small area tables, the random error introduced can be ignored except when very small cells are involved, in which case the impact on percentages and ratios can be significant.</p>

<p>Other published sources of individual benefit data have varying methods of disclosure control – rounding, perturbation and use of rating factors. This can lead to differences when comparing the published figures across the sources, of up to a few hundred cases.</p>

<p>The figures quoted within this background information note and the release it accompanies generally adhere to standard <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> rounding policy as shown in the following table.</p>

<p>All changes, percentage changes and totals are calculated prior to rounding.</p>

<p>While we aim to adhere to the rounding policy there are some rare occasions where this policy prevents realistic comparison of two figures where there are small differences. In such cases additional significant figures may be used.</p>
