<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bereavement-support-payment">Bereavement Support Payment (<abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr>)</a> was introduced in April 2017 and replaced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bereavement Payment</li>
  <li>Bereavement Allowance</li>
  <li>Widowed Parent’s Allowance</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> is payable to widows, widowers or surviving civil partners who are bereaved on or after 6 April 2017. It consists of an initial lump-sum followed by up to 18 monthly instalments.</p>

<p>A claimant is eligible if their partner either paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks or died due to an accident at work or disease caused by work. When they died, the claimant must have been under State Pension age and living in the UK or a country that pays bereavement benefits. <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> is tax-free and does not affect entitlement to other benefits or count towards the benefit cap.</p>

<p>There are 2 rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>higher</li>
  <li>standard</li>
</ul>

<p>Claimants who are entitled to Child Benefit or who were pregnant when their husband, wife or civil partner died will get the higher rate. All other claimants will get the standard rate.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the statistics</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Latest statistics and a full back-series to April 2017 are available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a>. This platform replaces the quarterly ODS tables which, historically, remain available as data tables in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-statistical-summaries">Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits statistical summaries</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Data on Stat-Xplore may not match previously published ODS data  tables due to improvements in data sources, methodology and rounding policy.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> statistics show how many claims have been received by the department each month and how many people are receiving <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> at the end of each month. All claims include Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) claims and a small number which are made in European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) and European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) countries, or countries with which we have a reciprocal agreement.</p>

<p>The statistics will be used in the department’s evaluation of the benefit. They will also be used to answer Parliamentary Questions and requests under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<h2>Source of the statistics</h2>

<p><abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> claims made in <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> are predominantly processed via the Claim Manager (<abbr title="Claim Manager">CM</abbr>) service which determines eligibility and entitlement. A feed of <abbr title="Claim Manager">CM</abbr> data is made available to create analytic datasets from which the statistics are derived. In addition, data on abroad cases is collated clerically via a Tracker as are a small proportion of clerical <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> cases.</p>

<h2>Definitions and coverage of the statistics</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> statistics contain 2 measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Claims Received</li>
  <li>Claims in Payment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Claims Received</h3>

<p>Claims Received measure refers to the total number of claims made to Bereavement Support Payment and received by the department, up to the reference date (the last day of the reporting month). Claims that do not progress to the individual receiving <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> will be included. There are many reasons why they may not receive <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr>; for example, the individual’s spouse may not have paid enough National Insurance Contributions. Only claims that have been cleared and with a valid National Insurance Number have been included in this measure.</p>

<p>Data available on Stat-Xplore provides more granular breakdowns of the statistics including: allowed and disallowed claims and reasons for disallowance. This reflects the initial decision recorded at the time the claim is cleared and therefore does not include any retrospective adjustments to the higher rate (claims showing decisions with a standard rate may later change to higher rate, for example for a claimant awaiting Child Benefit eligibility, in which case they will receive backdated higher payments to when they became eligible for Child Benefit).</p>

<h3>Claims in Payment</h3>

<p>Claims in Payment measure refers to the number of people who are in receipt of Bereavement Support Payment at a specific point in time (the last day of the reporting month).</p>

<p>Data available on Stat-Xplore provides more granular breakdowns of the statistics including Payment rate for Allowed claims. This rate represents the payment rate at the time of the reference date and includes backdating of Higher rate.</p>

<p>A small number of claims are started on Claim Manager but are then paid manually. Such claims are not included.
Statistics are also available by Residency based geographies derived from address information as recorded on the Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>). <abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr> is a more reliable source of addresses as it links to all of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit systems and contains the most up to date address for each individual. All higher level geographies (Lower Layer Super Output Area and Data Zone, Middle Layer Super Output Area and Intermediate Zone, Local Authority, Region, Country) are derived from Census Output Area (<abbr title="Census Output Area">COA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Statistics are also available by Age (individual age and bands) and Gender.</p>

<h2>Data Confidentiality</h2>

<p>Statistics are subject to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/metadata/Data%20Confidentiality.html" rel="external">Introduced Random Error</a> to ensure that no data is released which could risk the identification of individuals.</p>

<p>The statistics have been developed using guidelines set out by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/" rel="external">UK Statistics Authority Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<h2>Status of the statistics</h2>

<h3>Experimental Official statistics</h3>

<p>Statistics are badged as ‘Experimental’ since they have been largely derived from a newly available administrative feed, the <abbr title="Bereavement Support Payment">BSP</abbr> Claim Manager system. Their Status will be reviewed pending publication of statistics and User feedback.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/guidance-on-experimental-statistics" rel="external">publishing experimental statistics</a> for more information.</p>
