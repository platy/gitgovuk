<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> extended the data available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> for the May 2019 release to include Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>) and Incapacity Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance (<abbr title="Incapacity Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance">IBSDA</abbr>). Housing Benefit Flows statistics were moved to Stat-Xplore at November 2020. At February 2021 Stat-Xplore was expanded further to include Bereavement Support Payment (<abbr title="Bereavement Support Payments">BSP</abbr>) statistics.</p>

<p><abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> datasets were first made available on Stat-Xplore in June 2021. <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> data were expanded at August 2021 to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reassessments dataset (mirroring breakdowns available in other datasets like claimant characteristics, type of claim, degree of disablement for reassessments)</li>
  <li>Awards and payments for Pneumoconiosis (Worker’s Compensation) Act 1979 and 2008 Mesothelioma scheme datasets</li>
  <li>Decision time for <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> Assessments dataset, showing the number of days between the claim being received and the assessment being completed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Stat-Xplore is now the main dissemination tool for DWP benefit statistics. Older DWP datasets have been left on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/" rel="external">NOMIS</a> but are no longer refreshed with new data.</p>

<p>We publish National and Official statistics on the following benefit breakdowns every 6 months in May and November via data tables within the statistics collection:</p>

</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> State Pension statistics</h2>

<p>Following the introduction of a new State Pension computer system and its effects on our administrative data, we are not able to refresh Stat-Xplore with the latest State Pension data until further notice. Instead, we have produced supplementary data tables presenting caseload and average amount estimates using an alternative data source to cover the short fall.</p>

<p>During 2019, a new <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> computer system called “Get Your State Pension” (<abbr title="Get Your State Pension">GYSP</abbr>) came online to handle some new State Pension claims. Initially, the <abbr title="Get Your State Pension">GYSP</abbr> system handled claims received online through the gov.uk site, where people have been sent invitations to claim in this new way.</p>

<p>The number of State Pension recipients being handled by the new system has been gradually building up, and at August 2021 there were approximately 260,000 cases in payment on the new system. This represents 2.1% of the total number of State Pension recipients.</p>

<p><abbr title="Get Your State Pension">GYSP</abbr> system data are not yet ready for publication. To maintain accurate headline estimates for State Pension, we determined that we could use data from our payment system and create an approximation of the new system caseload. Our derived figures were then quality assured against Management Information and caseload estimates provided by the <abbr title="Get Your State Pension">GYSP</abbr> project team.</p>

<p>Following quality checking, we believe they provide a reliable estimate of the new caseload. When combined with existing data from the legacy system, we are confident that our temporary statistics are a good representation of the total number of State Pension beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The data tables provide estimates for November 2020 to August 2021. However, they are very much a temporary measure only. They will be withdrawn and replaced with new Stat-Xplore data once the <abbr title="Get Your State Pension">GYSP</abbr> system data have been reliably developed and tested.</p>

<p>Once we are ready to restore regular <abbr title="State Pension">SP</abbr> updates to Stat-Xplore, we will announce further plans for their inclusion.</p>

<p>A biannual release of supplementary tables to show State Pension deferment increments and proportions of beneficiaries receiving a full amount has also been suspended. This release is normally based on a 5% sample of the legacy computer system. Given the absence of <abbr title="Get Your State Pension">GYSP</abbr> data, the figures are affected by the same issues as described above. A decision was taken to temporarily suspend this supplementary release while we develop alternative sources, and the latest available time period for these figures remains September 2020.</p>

<p>5% sample data is used to produce tables for some breakdowns of State Pension. To create these tables, the 5% sample data is scaled up by a factor of 20.</p>

<p>Both men’s and women’s State Pension age reached 66 at October 2020. The Pensions Bill 2013 to 2014 contains provision for a State Pension age of 67 to be reached by 2028.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Impacts of coronavirus on benefit statistics</h2>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led to a major increase in operational activity across <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. As a result, temporary procedural easements were put in place. Such changes were necessary to continue to process claims while keeping customers and staff safe, while ensuring those eligible received their benefits. Examples of these easements are temporarily relaxing requirements for benefits claimants to provide copies of documents by post, and a temporary cessation of all face-to-face contact with benefit claimants. Most of these easements have not had a direct impact on benefit statistics data. However, there may be backlogs in the processing of claims for some benefits, and <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>, <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> and <abbr title="Carer’s Allowance">CA</abbr> data were specifically affected as follows.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr></h3>

<p>From May 2020, the <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> source data contain greatly increased numbers of cases with ethnicity recorded as ‘Prefer not to say’ or ‘Unknown’. This is attributed to temporary changes in the claim process as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as the priority was to get customers paid on time. With the resumption of telephone interviews in August 2020, reporting began to improve. However, the Stat-Xplore data should not be viewed as proportions or percentages for ethnicity without first excluding the ‘Prefer not to say’ or ‘Unknown’ cases beforehand.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr></h3>

<p>Between March 2020 and October 2020 easements in the processing of new and existing Attendance Allowance claims within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> led to a large increase in the number of cases being recorded with an unknown Main Disabling Condition. These easements were intended to enable claims to be processed and customers paid on time.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr></h3>

<p>Between March 2020 and July 2020, the assessment process to confirm eligibility to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> was paused. This included the reassessment process for <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claimants aged 16 transferring to <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>. This caused a temporary increase in <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> claimants aged 16 to 17.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr></h3>

<p>The Work Capability Assessment process for <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> has been affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. For more information see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/esa-outcomes-of-work-capability-assessments-including-mandatory-reconsiderations-and-appeals-january-2021">most recent <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Work Capability Assessment statistics</a>.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr></h3>

<p>During the pandemic, the assessment process of <abbr title="Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit">IIDB</abbr> claims was paused. Therefore the figures for the February 2021 and May 2021 release are reduced.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Carer’s Allowance">CA</abbr></h3>

<p>During the pandemic, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> disregarded some COVID-19 related breaks in care and partially relaxed its definition of care. Carer’s Allowance easements lasted until September 2021. They resulted in a higher proportion of claimants receiving a payment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	<abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data quality: interruption in data supplied from Hackney Borough Council</h2>

<p><abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> is different to other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits because it is administered by Local Authorities on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. To produce <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data and statistics, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> collate data returns from each of the Local Authorities in Great Britain (<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>) to produce a single data file called the Single Housing Benefit Extract (<abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr>). This extract contains administrative data from Local Authority computer systems. We then use two consecutive <abbr title="Single Housing Benefit Extract">SHBE</abbr> extracts to create publishable <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics and estimates.</p>

<p>During October 2020 Hackney Borough Council was subjected to a cyber attack. As a result of this criminal activity the authority was unable to supply any <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The interruption lasted until August 2021, and Hackney have now restored the supply of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The Council is currently processing a backlog of new Housing Benefit claims and changes of circumstance that have been received since October 2020.</p>

<p>Hackney Borough is the seventh largest Local Authority in terms of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> caseload. It accounts for 1% of all <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> cases and approximately 5% of the London region count. In line with <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> and London areas, Hackney’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimant numbers are declining steadily as <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> replaces <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> for working age claimants. Compared to <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>, a higher proportion of Hackney’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claimants are in employment and average award amounts for Hackney are substantially higher than <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts considered the effects of the interruption across the full range of products where <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> data is used. We compared different strategies for handling the gaps in our data. The approach we adopted used the last complete data return from Hackney (October 2020) as an approximation each time we published data up until services were restored. We used other trusted data sources to amend or “clean” Hackney’s data to help improve its quality as far as possible, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removed cases who had gone on to receive the Universal Credit Housing element</li>
  <li>removed cases where the claimant had died</li>
  <li>removed some cases where an entitling <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> claim had ended</li>
</ul>

<p>We tested this approach across a range of different scenarios, and we believe it allowed us to maintain a good approximation of the number of cases still on <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> at Hackney for this period. The data cleaning process did not introduce any significant bias to the lower level data, and ensured we used the best available evidence.</p>

<p>Having said that, no process of forecasting or substituting data can provide the same level of accuracy as using regularly updated data. The key disadvantage of this approach was that it relied on retaining older data, and no new claims to <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> in Hackney were available. The timeliness of the data suffered slightly, since the characteristics of the data may have changed over time, for example: as claimants get older.</p>

<p>The impacts on data quality and accuracy are more severe for lower level breakdowns where any Hackney cases are involved in the data, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Authority, Parliamentary Constituency or other low level geographical breakdowns involving Hackney – a higher level of data quality impacts for age of claimant and average award amounts</li>
  <li>London Regional level data, medium level impacts – statistics represent a good estimation of the overall caseload. Some lower level breakdowns should be treated with caution</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> level data, low level impacts – statistics will still represent a good estimation of the overall number of <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> claims across a full range of breakdowns</li>
  <li>all other geographical breakdowns not involving Hackney – no impacts on data quality</li>
</ul>

<p>During the interruption period, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> analysts routinely reviewed Hackney’s <abbr title="Housing Benefit">HB</abbr> statistics, and built in a range of additional quality checks to ensure estimates remained fit for publication. However, users should exercise additional caution wherever they produce lower level breakdowns for either London or Hackney over this period.</p>

<p>Hackney Borough Council have now resumed the supply of Housing Benefit data to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Since August 2021 data have been based on their more recent returns. However, it should be noted that while recovery work in Hackney is still ongoing statistics for this period are presented as a best available estimate, and have required some additional data management.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span> Revisions to medical condition <abbr title="International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems">ICD</abbr> high level grouping codes for <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> and <abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>/<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>In March 2018, the Department for Work and Pensions, as part of their quality assurance process, noticed discrepancies regarding the published figures for some disability benefit claimants by medical condition. The releases affected were <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> and <abbr title="Incapacity Benefit">IB</abbr>/<abbr title="Severe Disablement Allowance">SDA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>-<abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> sanctions; <abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr> and <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> were not impacted. Whilst the issues were investigated, all the information relating to medical conditions was removed from our online sources and a note was attached asking users to exercise caution whilst using these statistics.</p>

<p>The issues stemmed from the mapping of medical conditions on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> administrative system from <abbr title="Incapacity Reference Guide">IRG</abbr> (Incapacity Reference Guide) to <abbr title="International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems">ICD</abbr> (International Classification of Diseases), the form in which the statistics are published. In some cases, the <abbr title="Incapacity Reference Guide">IRG</abbr> framework had been changed without the relevant mapping having been updated to reflect this, whilst in others the mapping was found not to have been suitable from the outset. As such, certain medical conditions were being assigned to <abbr title="Incapacity Reference Guide">IRG</abbr> codes which were then being mapped to <abbr title="International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems">ICD</abbr> codes that did not correspond to the original conditions. The new mapping includes two new codes: External causes of morbidity and mortality and Codes for special purposes.</p>

<p>Having engaged with and received support from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> doctors, an updated mapping document was created and applied to the data, meaning that the statistics could be republished. Whilst many medical grouping caseload figures were unaffected, others have seen their numbers altered by the new system of mapping used with approximately 18% of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> medical codes now mapping to a different statistical medical condition group. At the higher-level at which the statistics are published, with the revised mapping applied to the data as of November 2017, 93% of the high level medical codes caseloads remain the same. We have no plans to reproduce a backseries as this would be extremely resource intensive to do, so we believe it’s better to use that resource to maintain production of existing statistics and develop new statistics that are being requested. We have provided explanatory notes for the historical data. Users are invited to use the updated statistics published in August 2018.</p>

<h3>Effect of revised mapping on high level <abbr title="International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems">ICD</abbr> codes for <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> as at November 2017</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Revisions to geographical outputs</h2>

<p>During 2018, improvements to the geography information in our statistics were brought into the majority of our legacy benefits. The changes reflect 2011 Census Output Areas and allow us to adhere to the latest geographical boundaries as defined by Office for National Statistics.</p>

<p>Part of these improvements included the use of a more reliable data source, the Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>), to obtain the geography information of our customers.</p>

<p>As a result:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residency based geographical breakdowns for Housing Benefits were refreshed in August and published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> with data from April 2018</li>
  <li>new geographies for most of our Legacy Benefits were refreshed in November and published on both <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">Stat-Xplore</a> with data from May 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-statistical-geographies-in-national-and-official-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> statistical geographies note</a>.</p>

<p>A Ward level hierarchy was introduced at August 2019 to enable the creation of Ward Level data.</p>

<p>In August 2021, as part of a periodic update, we refreshed the reference file used to assign geographies to our statistics in Stat-Xplore. For most geographical outputs, this change has had no impact. However, re-organisations have taken place at Local Authority and Ward level since the last release. Currently, our geography outputs are based on the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/" rel="external">National Statistics Postcode Lookup of May 2021</a>.</p>

<p>For users of Housing Benefit statistics, please note that following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, a new UK-managed international statistical geography - International Territorial Levels (<abbr title="International Territorial Levels">ITL</abbr>) – has been introduced from 1 January 2021, replacing the former Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (<abbr title="Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics">NUTS</abbr>) classification. Housing Benefit statistics on Stat-Xplore now provide the <abbr title="International Territorial Levels">ITL</abbr> hierarchy to reflect this. To help users manage this change, we plan to retain the <abbr title="Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics">NUTS</abbr> hierarchy on Stat-Xplore until May 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Scottish devolution</h2>

<p>On 1 April 2020, executive competence transferred to the Scottish Government for all remaining disability and industrial injuries benefits due to be devolved. While Social Security Scotland is building its delivery capacity <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is administering these benefits (Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payments, Attendance Allowance, Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance) on behalf of the Scottish Ministers for an interim period under agency agreements. The Scottish Government release summary statistics for Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance, Severe Disablement Allowance, and Carer’s Allowance in Scotland, consistent with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> figures.</p>

<p>The Scotland Act 2016 gives Scottish Parliament powers over a number of social security benefits which had been administered to Scottish claimants by the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>). In September 2018, Carer’s Allowance became the first of these benefits to have executive competency transferred from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to Scottish Ministers.</p>

<p>From that date <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is administering Carer’s Allowance on behalf of Scottish Ministers though an agency arrangement and recipients of Carer’s Allowance who live in Scotland have been eligible for Carer’s Allowance Supplement (<abbr title="Carer’s Allowance Supplement">CAS</abbr>), which will raise their Carer’s Allowance to the equivalent of the current rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance for 25 and over. <abbr title="Carer’s Allowance Supplement">CAS</abbr> payments are paid twice a year to people who are in receipt of Carer’s Allowance on eligibility dates set by the Scottish Government (April and October). Social Security Scotland have published information on recipients of <abbr title="Carer’s Allowance Supplement">CAS</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to publish the same Carer’s Allowance statistics as we do currently that cover the whole of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The Scottish Government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/about/statistics/social-security-scotland-statistics-publications" rel="external">publish summary statistics</a> for Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance, Severe Disablement Allowance, and Carer’s Allowance, consistent with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> figures.</p>

<p>Child Disability Payment is the first of the application-based disability benefits to be introduced by the Scottish Government. It replaces Disability Living Allowance for children living in Scotland. From July 2021, new applications were taken in Scotland for Child Disability Payment for children under 16 that live in the pilot areas of Dundee City, Na h-Eileanan Siar and Perth and Kinross. On 22 November 2021, Child Disability Payment launched nationwide to all new applicants living in Scotland.</p>

<p>The Disability Living Allowance figures presented to the end of August 2021 overlaps with the launch of Child Disability Payment in the pilot areas in Scotland detailed above.  This overlap accounts for approximately five weeks where new applications for Child Disability Payment in these areas were taken. Data on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov.scot/about/statistics/social-security-scotland-statistics-publications" rel="external">applications and payments</a> made for this time period is available. Due to the short time period and limited areas that applicants could apply from, the number of applications received were small and have had a very limited impact on Disability Living Allowance for child numbers.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span> <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> and <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> statistics on Stat-Xplore</h2>

<h3>Disability Living Allowance (<abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr>) payments</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> award is made up of two components; care and mobility.</p>

<p>Care component is for people who have needed help with personal care for at least 3 months and are likely to go on needing that help for at least a further 6 months. It is paid at 3 rates as shown in the following table.</p>

      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Highest</td>
      <td>For people who need help or supervision throughout both day and night, or who are terminally ill.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Middle</td>
      <td>For people who need frequent help or constant supervision during the day, supervision at night or someone to help while on dialysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lowest</td>
      <td>For people who need help for some of the day or with preparing cooked meals.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Mobility component for people who have had walking difficulties for at least 3 months and are likely to continue to have those difficulties for at least a further 6 months. It paid at 2 rates as shown in the following table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Rate</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Lower</td>
      <td>For people who can walk, but need guidance or supervision from another person when walking out of doors on unfamiliar routes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Nil rates exist for either component. Total payment amounts can be made up of either or both components.</p>

<h3>Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr>) payments</h3>

<p>Attendance Allowance does not contain a mobility component and is paid at 2 different rates as shown in the following table.</p>

<h3>Changes of circumstances and payment adjustments</h3>

<p>Entitlement to <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> or <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> can be affected by changes in individual circumstances – for example hospital admission, etc. <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> care and mobility components can be adjusted independently of one another. Normally, where adjustments take place, award components move to a Nil rate. For a very small proportion of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> mobility awards, the awards have been adjusted from the higher rate to lower rate.</p>

<p>The following table shows the proportions of awards have been adjusted for a specific reason:</p>

<p>Source: <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study, August 2019</p>

<p>On Stat-Xplore <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> and <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> datasets are broken down into 2 distinct types:</p>

<p>Cases with Entitlement: Totals for all entitled cases show both the number of people in receipt of an allowance and those with entitlement where the payment has been adjusted or suspended.</p>

<p>Cases in payment: This is a subset of the Cases with Entitlement dataset. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance. The dataset excludes those who have had their total award adjusted to zero, for example if they are staying in a care home or hospital.</p>

<p>In both the entitlement and in payment datasets there are breakdowns showing award types for care and mobility award components in the case of <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> and for the overall award type in the case of Attendance Allowance.</p>

<p>In the <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> Cases in Payment dataset, both of the award type fields have been amended to take into account payment adjustments. However, cases with both a nil care and nil mobility rate after adjustments will be excluded from this dataset.</p>

<p>In the <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> Cases in Payment dataset, all cases with a payment adjustment are excluded because they are no longer deemed to be in payment.</p>

<h3>Minor update to <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> and <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> Main Disabling Condition</h3>

<p>At August 2021, we introduced two new medical descriptors to the field Main Disabling Condition field on <abbr title="Attendance Allowance">AA</abbr> and <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> datasets:</p>

<p>The preferred source of numbers for Jobseeker’s Allowance is the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) claimant count figure; these are more up to date and contain clerical cases. However, the reason we use the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Jobseeker’s Allowance">JSA</abbr> figures is that they are consistent with the other benefits used to produce <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> National Statistics, and permit a wider set of breakdowns.

<span class="number">9. </span> Comparisons of benefit statistics with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit expenditure and caseload tables</h2>

<p>These benefit statistics are not intended to estimate overall <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit expenditure. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/benefit-expenditure-tables"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit expenditure and caseload tables</a> provide details on past expenditure and forecasts. These are based on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> accounting data and for a variety of reasons are not directly comparable to data on Stat-Xplore. For instance, the benefit expenditure and caseload tables present average benefit caseload across the financial year rather than on a quarterly or monthly basis. Caseload and average award data on Stat-Xplore should not be used to estimate benefit expenditure, as they do not capture the full information on amounts of benefit paid or duration of benefit claims.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span> Northern Ireland statistics</h2>

<p>The statistics in this Summary cover Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) only. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/topics/benefits-statistics" rel="external">comparable benefit statistics for Northern Ireland</a> and for <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/public/Home.aspx" rel="external">geographical breakdowns</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, the Northern Ireland statistics use extracts from the benefit systems very similar to those used to create the 100% sample numbers for Great Britain. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml" rel="external">directly equivalent <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr> numbers on Stat-Xplore</a>.</p>

<p>Housing Benefit is a social security benefit paid by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. It helps people on a low income pay their rent and rates. In Northern Ireland, rates are paid instead of Council Tax. Limited Housing Benefit numbers are available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/topics/housing-statistics" rel="external">housing statistics report</a>.</p>

<p>Employment Programs are different in Northern Ireland. Hence, statistics are not directly comparable. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/employment-programme-statistics" rel="external">numbers on the various schemes</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal Independence Payment and <abbr title="Disability Living Allowance">DLA</abbr> reassessments</h3>

<p>From 8 April 2013, the government introduced a new benefit called Personal Independence Payment to replace Disability Living Allowance for eligible working age people aged 16 to 64.

<h3>Universal Credit</h3>

<p>A new benefit that has started to replace six existing benefits and tax credits with a single monthly payment and will eventually replace:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Child Tax Credit</li>

<h3>Fraud and error statistics</h3>

<p>National Statistics are published presenting annual estimates of fraud and error in claims for Income Support, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Pension Credit and Housing Benefit, along with an annual estimate of the level of fraud and error in the benefit system as a whole. One-off benefit reviews have been carried out from time to time to estimate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system">fraud and error in claims for other benefits</a>.</p>

<h3>Take-up of income-related benefits</h3>

<p>Publications contain information on the take-up of the main income-related benefits in Great Britain: Income Support, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Employment and Support Allowance (income related) and Jobseeker’s Allowance (income based). Take-up is measured in two ways. Expenditure take-up compares the total amount of benefit received in the course of a year with the total amount that would have been received if everyone took up their entitlement for the full period of entitlement. Caseload take-up compares the number of benefit claimants – averaged over the year – with the number who would be receiving if everyone took up their entitlement for the full period of entitlement.</p>
