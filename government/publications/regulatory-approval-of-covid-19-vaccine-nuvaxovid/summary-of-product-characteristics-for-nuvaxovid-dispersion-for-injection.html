<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Clinical particulars</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Therapeutic indications</h3>

<p>Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Posology and method of administration</h3>

<h4>Posology</h4>

<h4>Individuals 18 years of age and older</h4>

<p>Nuvaxovid is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose (see section 5.1).</p>

<p>There are no data available on the interchangeability of Nuvaxovid with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the primary vaccination course. Individuals who have received a first dose of Nuvaxovid should receive the second dose of Nuvaxovid to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The safety and efficacy of Nuvaxovid in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. No data are available.</p>

<h4>Elderly population</h4>

<p>No dose adjustment is required in elderly individuals â¥ 65 years of age.</p>

<h4>Method of administration</h4>

<p>Nuvaxovid is for intramuscular injection only, preferably into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>

<p>The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.</p>

<p>For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.</p>

<p>For instructions on handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Contraindications</h3>

<p>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Special warnings and precautions for use</h3>

<h4>Traceability</h4>

<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<h4>Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis</h4>

<p>Events of anaphylaxis have been reported with COVID-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. A second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose of Nuvaxovid.</p>

<h4>Anxiety-related reactions</h4>

<p>Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation, or stressârelated reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.</p>

<h4>Concurrent illness</h4>

<p>Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.</p>

<h4>Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders</h4>

<p>As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.</p>

<h4>Immunocompromised individuals</h4>

<p>The efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the vaccine has been assessed in a limited number of immunocompromised individuals. The efficacy of Nuvaxovid may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.</p>

<h4>Duration of protection</h4>

<p>The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<h4>Limitations of vaccine effectiveness</h4>

<p>Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, vaccination with Nuvaxovid may not protect all vaccine recipients.</p>

<h4>Excipients</h4>

<h4>Sodium</h4>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially âsodium-freeâ.</p>

<h4>Potassium</h4>

<p>This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 mL, that is to say, essentially âpotassium-freeâ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</h3>

<p>Co-administration of Nuvaxovid with inactivated influenza vaccines has been evaluated in a limited number of participants in an exploratory clinical trial sub-study, see section 4.8 and section 5.1.</p>

<p>The binding antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was lower when Nuvaxovid was given concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown.</p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Nuvaxovid with other vaccines has not been studied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h3>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4>

<p>There is limited experience with use of Nuvaxovid in pregnant women.</p>

<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/fetal development, parturition, or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</p>

<p>Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and fetus.</p>

<h4>Breast-feeding</h4>

<p>It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk.</p>

<h4>Fertility</h4>

<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Effects on ability to drive and use machines</h3>

<p>Nuvaxovid has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Undesirable effects</h3>

<h4>Summary of safety profile</h4>

<p>The safety of Nuvaxovid was evaluated from an interim analysis of pooled data from 5 ongoing clinical trials conducted in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. At the time of the analysis, a total of 49,950 participants age 18 years and older received at least one dose of Nuvaxovid (n=30,058) or placebo (n=19,892). At the time of vaccination, the median age was 48 years (range 18 to 95 years). The median duration of follow-up was 70 days post-Dose 2, with 32,993 (66%) participants completing more than 2 months follow-up post-Dose 2.</p>

<p>Of the pooled reactogenicity data, which includes participants age 18 years and older enrolled in the two phase 3 studies who received at least one dose of Nuvaxovid (n = 19,898) or placebo (n = 10,454), the most frequent adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (75%), injection site pain (62%), fatigue (53%), myalgia (51%), headache (50%), malaise (41%), arthralgia (24%), and nausea or vomiting (15%). Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of less than or equal to 2 days for local events and less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following vaccination.</p>

<p>Overall, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, and nausea or vomiting was higher in adults aged 18 to less than 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above.</p>

<p>Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1.</p>

<p>Licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were co-administered to participants on the same day as Dose 1 of Nuvaxovid (n = 217) or placebo (n = 214) in the opposite deltoid muscle of the arm in 431 participants enrolled in an exploratory Phase 3 (2019nCoV-302) sub-study. The frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions in the influenza sub-study population was higher than in the main study population following Dose 1 in both Nuvaxovid and placebo recipients.</p>

<p>Tabulated list of adverse reactions</p>

<p>Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories:</p>

<p>Very common (â¥ 1/10),</p>

<p>Common (â¥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10),</p>

<h4>Description of selected adverse reactions</h4>

<p>Throughout the clinical trials, an increased incidence of hypertension following vaccination with Nuvaxovid (n=46, 1.0%) as compared to placebo (n=22, 0.6%) was observed in older adults during the 3 days following vaccination.</p>

<p>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow card. Reporting forms and information can be found at https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk or you can search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. When reporting, please include the vaccine brand and batch/lot number, if available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with Nuvaxovid can be reported to Novavax at www.NovavaxCovidVaccine.com or via +44 020 3514 1838. Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Novavax and MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>

<p>No case of overdose has been reported. In the event of an overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>	Pharmacological properties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>  Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>

<p>Nuvaxovid is composed of purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein that is stabilised in its prefusion conformation. The addition of the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant facilitates activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S protein-specific immune response. The two vaccine components elicit B- and T-cell immune responses to the S protein, including neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.</p>

<h4>Clinical efficacy</h4>

<p>The clinical efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Nuvaxovid is being evaluated in two pivotal, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies, Study 1 (2019nCoV-301) conducted in North America and Study 2 (2019nCoV-302) conducted in the United Kingdom, and a Phase 2a/b study, Study 3, conducted in South Africa.</p>

<h4>Study 1 (2019nCoV-301)</h4>

<p>Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in participants 18 years of age and older in United States and Mexico. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years and â¥ 65 years) and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The study excluded participants who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; active cancer on chemotherapy; received chronic immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 90 days; were pregnant or breastfeeding; or had a history of laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with clinically stable underlying comorbidity were included as were participants with well-controlled HIV infection.</p>

<p>Enrolment of adults completed in February 2021. Participants will be followed for up to 24 months after the second dose for assessments of safety, and efficacy against COVID-19. Following collection of sufficient safety data to support application for emergency use authorisation, initial recipients of placebo were invited to receive two injections of Nuvaxovid 21 days apart and initial recipients of Nuvaxovid to receive two injections of placebo 21 days apart (âblinded crossoverâ). All participants were offered the opportunity to continue to be followed in the study.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Efficacy [PP-EFF] analysis set) included 25,452 participants who received either Nuvaxovid (n = 17,312) or placebo (n = 8,140), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 at day 21, median 21 days [IQR 21-23], range 14-60), did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after the second dose.</p>

<p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received Nuvaxovid and those who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who received Nuvaxovid, the median age was 47 years (range: 18 to 95 years); 88% (n = 15,264) were 18 to 64 years old and 12% (n = 2,048) were aged 65 and older; 48% were female; 94% were from the United States and 6% were from Mexico; 76% were White, 11% were Black or African American, 6% were American Indian (including Native Americans) or Alaskan Native, and 4% were Asian; 22% were Hispanic or Latino. At least one pre-existing comorbidity or lifestyle characteristic associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 was present in 16,493 (95%) participants. Comorbidities included: obesity (body mass index (BMI) â¥ 30 kg/m2); chronic lung disease; diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Other high-risk characteristics included age â¥65 years (with or without comorbidities) or age &lt;65 years with comorbidities and/or living or working conditions involving known frequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or to densely populated circumstances.</p>

<p>COVID-19 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) through a central laboratory. Vaccine efficacy is presented in Table 2.</p>

<p>Vaccine efficacy of Nuvaxovid to prevent the onset of COVID-19 from seven days after Dose 2 was 90.4% (95% CI 82.9 â 94.6). No cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 17,312 Nuvaxovid participants compared with 4 cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the 8,140 placebo recipients in the PP-EFF analysis set.</p>

<p>Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates for male and female participants and racial groups, and across participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19. There were no meaningful differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at increased risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. BMI â¥ 30 kg/m2, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease).</p>

<p>Efficacy results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when strains classified as 
Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest were predominantly circulating in the two countries (US and Mexico) where the study was conducted. Sequencing data were available for 61 of the 77 endpoint cases (79%). Of these, 48 out of 61 (79%) were identified as Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest. The most common Variants of Concern identified were: Alpha with 31/61 cases (51%), Beta (2/61, 4%) and Gamma (2/61, 4%), while the most common Variants of Interest were Iota with 8/61 cases (13%), and Epsilon (3/61, 5%).</p>

<h4>Study 2 (2019nCoV-302)</h4>

<p>Study 2 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in participants 18 to 84 years of age in the United Kingdom. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years; 65 to 84 years) to receive Nuvaxovid or placebo. The study excluded participants who were significantly immunocompromised due to immunodeficiency disease; current diagnosis or treatment for cancer; autoimmune disease/condition; received chronic immunosuppressive therapy or received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 90 days; bleeding disorder or continuous use of anticoagulants; history of allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis; were pregnant; or had a history of laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19. Participants with clinically stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 4 weeks before enrolment were included. Participants with known stable infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) were not excluded from enrolment.</p>

<p>Enrolment was completed in November 2020. Participants are being followed for up to 12 months after the primary vaccination series for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included 14,039 participants who received either Nuvaxovid (n = 7,020) or placebo (n = 7,019), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 at median 21 days (IQR 21-23), range 16-45, did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after the second dose.</p>

<p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who received Nuvaxovid, median age was 56.0 years (range: 18 to 84 years); 72% (n = 5,067) were 18 to 64 years old and 28% (n = 1,953) were aged 65 to 84; 49% were female; 94% were White; 3% were Asian; 1% were multiple races, &lt;1% were Black or African American; and &lt;1% were Hispanic or Latino; and 45% had at least one comorbid condition.</p>

<p>These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when the B.1.17 (Alpha) variant was circulating in the UK. Identification of the Alpha variant was based on S gene target failure by PCR. Data were available for 95 of the 106 endpoint cases (90%). Of these, 66 out of 95 (69%) were identified as the Alpha variant with the other cases classified as non-Alpha.</p>

<p>No cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the 7,020 Nuvaxovid participants compared with 4 cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the 7,019 placebo recipients in the PP-EFF analysis set.</p>

<h4>Licensed seasonal influenza vaccine co-administration sub-study</h4>

<p>Overall, 431 participants were co-vaccinated with inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines; 217 sub-study participants received Nuvaxovid and 214 received placebo. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the per-protocol immunogenicity (PP-IMM) analysis set for participants who received Nuvaxovid (n = 191), median age was 40 years (range: 22 to 70 years); 93% (n = 178) were 18 to 64 years old and 7% (n = 13) were aged 65 to 84; 43% were female; 75% were White; 23% were multiracial or from ethnic minorities; and 27% had at least one comorbid condition. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune responses as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. A 30% reduction in antibody responses to Nuvaxovid was noted as assessed by an anti-spike IgG assay with seroconversion rates similar to participants who did not receive concomitant influenza vaccine (see section 4.5 and section 4.8).</p>

<h4>Study 3 (2019nCoV-501)</h4>

<p>Study 3 is an ongoing Phase 2a/b, multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study in HIV-negative participants 18 to 84 years of age and people living with HIV (PLWH) 18 to 64 years of age in South Africa. PLWH were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections), receiving highly active and stable antiretroviral therapy, and having an HIV-1 viral load of &lt; 1000 copies/mL.</p>

<p>Enrolment was completed in November 2020.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy analysis set (PP-EFF) included 2,770 participants who received either Nuvaxovid (n = 1,408) or placebo (n = 1,362), received two doses (Dose 1 on day 0; Dose 2 on day 21), did not experience an exclusionary protocol deviation, and did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through 7 days after the second dose.</p>

<p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced amongst participants who received Nuvaxovid and participants who received placebo. In the PP-EFF analysis set for participants who received Nuvaxovid, median age was 28 years (range: 18 to 84 years); 40% were female; 91% were Black/African American; 2% were White; 3% were multiple races, 1% were Asian; and 2% were Hispanic or Latino; and 5.5% were HIV-positive.</p>

<p>A total of 147 symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 cases among all adult participants, seronegative (to SARS-CoV-2) at baseline, were accrued for the complete analysis (PP-EFF Analysis Set) of the primary efficacy endpoint, with 51 (3.62%) cases for Nuvaxovid versus 96 (7.05%) cases for placebo. The resultant vaccine efficacy of Nuvaxovid was 48.6% (95% CI: 28.4, 63.1).</p>

<p>These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when the B.1.351 (Beta) variant was circulating in South Africa.</p>

<h4>Elderly population</h4>

<p>Nuvaxovid was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older. The efficacy of Nuvaxovid was consistent between elderly (â¥ 65 years) and younger individuals (18 to 64 years).</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The licensing authority has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Nuvaxovid in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19, see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.</p>

<h4>Conditional approval</h4>

<p>This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called âconditional approvalâ scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited.  New information on this medicinal product will be reviewed at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.</p>
