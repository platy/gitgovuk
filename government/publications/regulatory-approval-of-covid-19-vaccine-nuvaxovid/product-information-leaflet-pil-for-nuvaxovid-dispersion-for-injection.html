<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What Nuvaxovid is and what it is used for</h2>

<p>Nuvaxovid is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>Nuvaxovid is given to adults 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and specialised white blood cells that work against the virus, to give protection against COVID-19. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What you need to know before you receive Nuvaxovid</h2>

<p>Nuvaxovid should not be given</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Warnings and precautions</h4>

<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have ever had a severe or life-threatening allergic reaction after receiving any other vaccine injection or after you were given Nuvaxovid in the past,</li>
  <li>you have ever fainted following any needle injection,</li>
  <li>you have a high fever (over 38°C) or severe infection. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold,</li>
  <li>you have bleeding problems, you bruise easily, or you use a medicine to prevent blood clots,</li>
  <li>your immune system does not work properly (immunodeficiency) or you are taking medicines that weaken the immune system (such as high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or cancer medicines).</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you are given Nuvaxovid.</p>

<p>As with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of Nuvaxovid may not fully protect all those who receive it, and it is not known how long you will be protected.</p>

<h4>Children and adolescents</h4>

<p>Nuvaxovid is not recommended for children aged below 18 years. Currently, there is no information available on the use of Nuvaxovid in children younger than 18 years of age.</p>

<h4>Other medicines and Nuvaxovid</h4>

<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines or vaccines.</p>

<h4>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</h4>

<p>If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse for advice before you receive this vaccine.</p>

<h4>Driving and using machines</h4>

<p>Some of the side effects of Nuvaxovid listed in section 4 (Possible side effects) may temporarily reduce your ability to drive and use machines (for example, feeing faint or lightheaded or feeling very tired).</p>

<p>Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination.  Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.</p>

<h4>Nuvaxovid contains sodium and potassium</h4>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 milligrams) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say, essentially ‘potassium-free’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How Nuvaxovid is given</h2>

<p>Nuvaxovid will be given to you as two separate 0.5 mL injections.</p>

<p>Your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle, usually in your upper arm.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you receive the second dose of Nuvaxovid 3 weeks after your first dose to receive the full course of this vaccine.</p>

<p>During and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>If you miss an appointment for your second injection of Nuvaxovid, ask your doctor or nurse for advice. If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected against COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Possible side effects</h2>

<p>Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects go away within a few days of appearing.  If symptoms persist, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.</p>

<p>As with other vaccines, you may feel pain or discomfort at the injection site, or you may see some redness and swelling at this site. However, these reactions usually clear up within a few days.</p>

<p>Get urgent medical attention if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feeling faint or light-headed</li>
  <li>changes in your heartbeat</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>

  <li>swelling of your lips, face, or throat</li>
  <li>hives or rash</li>
  <li>nausea or vomiting</li>
