<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document is part of a suite of documents which sets out our regulatory requirements for awarding organisations offering Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications at Level 3. These conditions and requirements come into effect at 12.30pm on Thursday 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>This document sets out the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our Qualification Level Conditions for Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications, which we have set using our powers under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/134" rel="external">section 134 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009</a>, and</li>
  <li>our requirements in relation to assessment strategies, qualification purposes, assessments, and standard setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to all Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications, awarding organisations must also comply with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook">General Conditions of Recognition</a>, which apply to all awarding organisations and qualifications, and</li>
  <li>all relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulatory-document-list">Regulatory Documents</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Condition ATQ1: Interpretation and Definitions</h3>

<h4>ATQ1.1</h4>

<p>The rules of interpretation and definitions outlined in General Condition J1 shall apply to the Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications Qualification Level Conditions.</p>

<h4>ATQ1.2</h4>

<p>Except in the circumstances described in Condition ATQ1.3, the requirements imposed by the Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications Qualification Level Conditions apply in addition to the requirements imposed by the General Conditions of Recognition.</p>

<h4>ATQ1.3</h4>

<p>To the extent that there is any inconsistency between –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) a requirement of an Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification Level Condition and an awarding organisation’s ability to provide either a particular type of Reasonable Adjustment or Special Consideration, such that the awarding organisation is prevented from providing that Reasonable Adjustment or Special Consideration, the awarding organisation may provide that Reasonable Adjustment or Special Consideration and is not obliged to comply with the requirement of the Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications Qualification Level Condition,</li>
  <li>(b) in all other cases, a requirement of an Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications Qualification Level Condition and a requirement of a General Condition of Recognition, such that an awarding organisation could not comply with both such requirements, the awarding organisation must comply with the requirement of the Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications Qualification Level Condition and is not obliged to comply with the requirement of the General Condition of Recognition.</li>
</ol>

<h4>ATQ 1.4</h4>

<p>In these Conditions, the following words shall have the meaning given to them below (and cognate expressions should be construed accordingly) –</p>

<h5>Alternative Academic Qualification</h5>

<p>A qualification –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) that is approved by the Secretary of State for Education on or after [DATE] for public funding as an [Alternative Academic Qualification],</li>
  <li>(b) to which an awarding organisation has assigned Level 3 under Condition E9.1, and</li>
  <li>(c) that is not –
    <ol>
      <li>(i) a qualification to which any Qualification Level Conditions other than the Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification Level Conditions apply,</li>
      <li>(i) an International Baccalaureate diploma,</li>
      <li>(i) a performing arts graded examination, or</li>
      <li>(i) a core maths qualification.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This includes a qualification that fell within paragraph (a) at any time on or after the date on which these conditions came into effect, but which is no longer publicly funded for any reason.</p>

<h5>Alternative Technical Qualification</h5>

<p>A qualification –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) that is approved by the Secretary of State for Education on or after [DATE] for public funding as a technical qualification,</li>
  <li>(b) to which an awarding organisation has assigned Level 3 under Condition E9.1,</li>
  <li>(c) that is not a Technical Qualification, and</li>
  <li>(d) that falls within one of the following categories as defined by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education –
    <ol>
      <li>(i)…</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This includes a qualification that fell within criterion (a) at any time on or after the date on which these conditions came into effect, but which is no longer publicly funded for any reason.</p>

<h5>Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification</h5>

<p>An Alternative Academic Qualification or Alternative Technical Qualification, as the case may be.</p>

<h5>Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications Qualification Level Condition</h5>

</ol>

<h2>Assessment strategy requirements</h2>

<p>Condition ATQ2.1(a) requires an awarding organisation to establish and maintain an assessment strategy for each Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available. Condition ATQ2.2 requires an awarding organisation to ensure that the assessment strategy for an Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification sets out how the awarding organisation intends to secure, on an ongoing basis, compliance with its Conditions of Recognition in respect of the assessments for that qualification.</p>

<p>Condition ATQ2.1(b) requires an awarding organisation to have regard to any requirements in relation to assessment strategies published by Ofqual.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition ATQ2.1(b) below.</p>

<h3>Assessment strategy requirements for Alternative Academic Qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition ATQ2.1(a) requires an awarding organisation to establish and maintain an assessment strategy for each Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available. Condition ATQ2.2 requires an awarding organisation to ensure that the assessment strategy for an Alternative Academic or&nbsp;Alternative Technical Qualification sets out how the awarding organisation intends to secure, on an ongoing basis, compliance with its Conditions of Recognition in respect of the assessments for that qualification.</p>

<p>Condition ATQ2.4 requires an awarding organisation to keep its assessment strategy under review, and to promptly notify Ofqual of any revisions made. An assessment strategy should be treated as a live working document which should be updated as necessary, considering evidence from assessment development, delivery and monitoring so qualifications and assessments continue to be fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Condition ATQ2.1(b) requires an awarding organisation to comply with any requirements, and have regard to any guidance, in relation to assessment strategies published by Ofqual.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition ATQ2.1(b) below</p>

<h4>General Requirements</h4>

<p>There are three key properties of effective assessment strategies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A coherent and logical narrative</li>
  <li>The use of argument and justification with evidence</li>
  <li>A focus on the fitness for purpose of the qualification</li>
</ol>

<h5>1. A coherent and logical narrative</h5>

<p>An assessment strategy must present a coherent and logical narrative demonstrating how an awarding organisation will seek to ensure that the qualification meets the requirements in the Conditions in relation to assessments. The detailed requirements section below sets out the aspects of the qualification that need to be covered within the assessment strategy. However, the assessment strategy should not be presented as a set of discrete responses to the matters set out below, as this approach risks lacking coherence. Rather, it must demonstrate consistency between different justifications and explanations, by –</p>

<ul>
  <li>linking back to previously referred aspects (for example the assessment model should be demonstrably consistent with the purpose of the qualification), and</li>
  <li>demonstrating clear consideration and understanding of the consequences of decisions (for example, of the implications of the assessment model used for the approach to setting and maintaining standards).</li>
</ul>

<p>Many decisions entail trade-offs (for example between Comparability and Manageability in tasks where centres might have a choice of task depending on their access to resources). These should be addressed as appropriate, so that the thinking behind the key decisions that the awarding organisation has made in developing the qualification is clear.</p>

<h5>2. The use of argument and justification with evidence</h5>

<p>In an assessment strategy, all statements that may have implications for the fitness for purpose of the qualification should be underpinned with clear and concise argument and evidence. Such statements should not constitute only assertion. For example, the following statements provide no evidence or justification to support the assertions that they make:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The two external assessments will comprise only multiple-choice questions. This question type aligns best with the type of content we are assessing in this qualification.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The types of evidence produced by the assessments lends itself to internal marking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning and evidence behind such assertions must be provided. An awarding organisation should focus on the inclusion of material that supports its arguments for the fitness for purpose of the qualification.</p>

<p>For example, an awarding organisation should not include descriptions of processes or include or refer to pre-existing process documentation if the relevance of this content to the&nbsp;Validity   and fitness for purpose of the assessments has not specifically been drawn out.</p>

<h5>3. A focus on the fitness for purpose of the qualification</h5>

<p>The purpose of an assessment strategy is to explain the choices that have been made in the development of the qualification and the approach to its ongoing monitoring will help ensure that the qualification meets the Conditions and is thus Valid and otherwise fit for purpose.</p>

<p>In particular, where an awarding organisation seeks an exemption under Condition ATQ5.2 from any requirement in relation to assessment, it must highlight this intention and ensure that its alternative approach is fully justified within the assessment strategy, including consideration of the consequential risks</p>

<h4>Assessment strategy structure</h4>

<p>It is up to an awarding organisation to decide how to structure its assessment strategy. The assessment strategy is a live document that will be used and updated throughout the lifetime of the qualification. The awarding organisation should structure it in a way that supports this.</p>

<p>In doing this an awarding organisation may, for example, choose to develop separate parts of its assessment strategy that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are specific to an individual qualification (for example a Level 3 Award in Childcare)</li>
  <li>apply to suites of related or similar qualifications (for example a suite of qualifications in Education and Childcare)</li>
  <li>are generic to a particular group of qualifications or to all of its qualifications (for example, all of its Level 3 Awards in all subjects).</li>
</ul>

<p>An awarding organisation should explain clearly how any separate parts of an assessment strategy relate to each other. It should also explain how each of these separate parts will be kept under review, and revised where necessary, in light of the others. Taken together, such parts should form a coherent and integrated whole.</p>

<h4>Detailed requirements</h4>

<p>We set out below our detailed requirements on the specific information and evidence an awarding organisation must include in its assessment strategy. The requirements are set out in eight sections, as shown below. These sections are intended to represent the key stages in the lifecycle of a qualification, and an awarding organisation’s assessment strategy must be structured so as to reflect them. Depending on the approach to structuring its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation may find it useful to cover content from these sections in both an overarching document that covers its approach to a suite of qualifications and a document specific to an individual qualification.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Qualification purpose</li>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>Assessment design</li>
  <li>Assessment delivery</li>
  <li>Marking or assessing performance and standardisation</li>
  <li>Attainment and reporting</li>
  <li>Standard setting and maintenance</li>
  <li>Qualification monitoring</li>
</ol>

<p>For each of the eight sections, indicative content is provided within a table that includes subheadings, corresponding questions, an explanation of the importance of those questions, and the Conditions to which they relate. In many cases, the column explaining the importance of information will also make clear where links should be made to other aspects of the qualification to aid the coherence of the document.</p>

<p>The subheadings, key questions and explanations in each section have been specifically written to reflect the key areas of qualification development that should be addressed and to reflect their approximate sequence as part of the qualification lifecycle. Assessment strategies must address the subheadings and questions contained in them. They may be structured according to the sections in the table. However, they must also reflect the need for decisions to be linked back appropriately to previous sections and must demonstrate clear consideration and understanding of their consequences (see general requirements under ‘A coherent and logical narrative’ above). Depending on the nature of a particular qualification, there may also be additional areas that require focus. Similarly, some areas covered in the table may require more extended focus, while other areas may not be applicable.</p>

<p>Assessment strategies should refer, as appropriate, to the proposed or existing assessment materials (for example questions, tasks and mark schemes) to exemplify any points or arguments made within the document. Assessment strategies should also refer, as appropriate, to existing policies or procedures to support the awarding organisation in demonstrating how it will seek to ensure that the qualification meets the requirements in the Conditions in relation to assessments (for example Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies).</p>

<h5>Section 1: Qualification purpose</h5>

<p>This refers to the initial approach to scoping the specification, including clearly defining the purposes of the assessment.</p>

      <td>Key aspects of the qualification, including the content and assessment structure, must be designed to be consistent with the qualification purpose. <br><br>A clear purpose will ensure that users of the qualification are not misled.<br><br>A qualification typically has a number of different purposes that it is seeking to fulfil. When defining the purposes of a qualification, awarding organisations should consider them from different perspectives. These include the following:<br><br> • The use to which the qualification outcomes will be put. The results of a qualification are likely to be used in different ways by a range of potential users. For example, results for individual learners may be used to identify appropriateness for recruitment to employment or further study, to signify licence to practise, and/or by the learner to make decisions regarding their own future. Results may also be used in aggregate from across learners. For example, results may be combined across learners taking qualifications within a centre for measures used to hold that centre to account.<br><br> • The expertise that learners will acquire through participation in the qualification, and the nature of that expertise. For example, a qualification may develop understanding of a broad body of knowledge, skills and understanding in a particular area, or it may support the mastery of specified skills relevant to a defined discipline. <br><br> • The role participation in the qualification plays in engaging learners. The existence of a qualification and the assessment(s) it contains will play a role in engaging learners. That may be engaging learners in education or training in general or be in relation to the specific area to which the qualification is relevant. For example, some qualifications may have the specific purpose of seeking to (re)engage learners likely to have particular previous experiences or reflect a particular context within which the qualification will be encountered.<br><br>Defining the purposes of a qualification in these terms, and considering their relative importance – including in terms of the intended priority order set out in Condition ATQ8.2 – is likely to aid an effective qualification design process by informing the range of trade-offs required when making design decisions. These trade-offs and design decisions should be documented in the assessment strategy.</td>

<h3>Assessment strategy requirements for Alternative Technical Qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition ATQ2.1(a) requires an awarding organisation to establish and maintain an assessment strategy for each Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualification which it makes available or proposes to make available. Condition ATQ2.2 requires an awarding organisation to ensure that the assessment strategy for an Alternative Academic or&nbsp;Alternative Technical Qualification sets out how the awarding organisation intends to secure, on an ongoing basis, compliance with its Conditions of Recognition in respect of the assessments for that qualification.</p>

<p>Condition ATQ2.4 requires an awarding organisation to keep its assessment strategy under review, and to promptly notify Ofqual of any revisions made. An assessment strategy should be treated as a live working document which should be updated as necessary considering evidence from assessment development, delivery and monitoring so that qualifications and assessments continue to be fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Condition ATQ2.1(b) requires an awarding organisation to comply with any requirements, and have regard to any guidance, in relation to assessment strategies published by Ofqual.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition ATQ2.1(b) below</p>

<h4>General requirements</h4>

<p>There are three key properties of effective assessment strategies   :</p>

<ol>
  <li>A coherent and logical narrative</li>
  <li>The use of argument and justification with evidence</li>
  <li>A focus on the fitness for purpose of the qualification</li>
</ol>

<h5>1. A coherent and logical narrative</h5>

<p>An assessment strategy must present a coherent and logical narrative demonstrating how an awarding organisation will seek to ensure that the qualification meets the requirements in the Conditions in relation to assessments. The detailed requirements section below sets out the aspects of the qualification that need to be covered within the assessment strategy. However, the assessment strategy should not be presented as a set of discrete responses to the matters set out below, as this approach risks lacking coherence. Rather, it must demonstrate consistency between different justifications and explanations, by –</p>

<ul>
  <li>linking back to previously referred aspects (for example, the assessment model should be demonstrably consistent with the purpose of the qualification), and</li>
  <li>demonstrating clear consideration and understanding of the consequences of decisions (for example, of the implications of the assessment model used for the approach to setting and maintaining standards).</li>
</ul>

<p>Many decisions entail trade-offs (for example, between Comparability and Manageability in tasks where centres might have a choice of task depending on their access to resources). These should be addressed as appropriate, so that the thinking behind the key decisions that the awarding organisation has made in developing the qualification is clear.</p>

<h5>2. The use of argument and justification with evidence</h5>

<p>In an assessment strategy, all statements that may have implications for the fitness for purpose of the qualification should be underpinned with clear and concise argument and evidence. Such statements should not constitute only assertion. For example, the following statements provide no evidence or justification to support the assertions that they make –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The two external assessments will comprise only multiple-choice questions. This question type aligns best with the type of content we are assessing in this qualification.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The types of evidence produced by the assessments lends itself to internal marking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning and evidence behind such assertions must be provided. An awarding organisation should focus on the inclusion of material that supports its arguments for the fitness for purpose of the qualification.</p>

<p>For example, an awarding organisation should not include descriptions of processes or include or refer to pre-existing process documentation if the relevance of this content to the&nbsp;Validity&nbsp;and fitness for purpose of the assessments has not specifically been drawn out.</p>

<h5>3. A focus on the fitness for purpose of the qualification</h5>

<p>The purpose of an assessment strategy is to explain the choices that have been made in the development of the qualification and the approach to its ongoing monitoring will help ensure that the qualification meets the Conditions and is thus Valid and otherwise fit for purpose.</p>

<h4>Assessment strategy structure</h4>

<p>It is up to an awarding organisation to decide how to structure its assessment strategy. The assessment strategy is a live document that will be used and updated throughout the lifetime of the qualification. The awarding organisation should structure it in a way that supports this.</p>

<p>In doing this, an awarding organisation may, for example, choose to develop separate parts of its assessment strategy that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are specific to an individual qualification (for example, a Level 3 Award in Childcare)</li>
  <li>apply to suites of related or similar qualifications (for example, a suite of qualifications in Education and Childcare)</li>
  <li>are generic to a particular group of qualifications or to all of its qualifications (for example, all of its Level 3 Awards in all subjects).</li>
</ul>

<p>An awarding organisation should explain clearly how any separate parts of an assessment strategy relate to each other. It should also explain how each of these separate parts will be kept under review, and revised where necessary, in light of the others. Taken together, such parts should form a coherent and integrated whole.</p>

<h4>Detailed requirements</h4>

<p>We set out below our detailed requirements on the specific information and evidence an awarding organisation must include in its assessment strategy. The requirements are set out in eight sections, as shown below. These sections are intended to represent the key stages in the lifecycle of a qualification, and an awarding organisation’s assessment strategy must be structured so as to reflect them. Depending on the approach to structuring its assessment strategy, an awarding organisation may find it useful to cover content from these sections in both an overarching document that covers its approach to a suite of qualifications and a document specific to an individual qualification.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Qualification purpose</li>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>Assessment design</li>
  <li>Assessment delivery</li>
  <li>Marking or assessing performance and standardisation</li>
  <li>Attainment and reporting</li>
  <li>Standard setting and maintenance</li>
  <li>Qualification monitoring</li>
</ol>

<p>For each of the eight sections, indicative content is provided within a table that includes subheadings, corresponding questions, an explanation of the importance of those questions, and the Conditions to which they relate. In many cases, the column explaining the importance of information will also make clear where links should be made to other aspects of the qualification to aid the coherence of the document.</p>

<p>The subheadings, key questions and explanations in each section have been specifically written to reflect the key areas of qualification development that should be addressed and to reflect their approximate sequence as part of the qualification lifecycle. Assessment strategies must address the subheadings and questions contained in them. They may be structured according to the sections in the table. However, they must also reflect the need for decisions to be linked back appropriately to previous sections and must demonstrate clear consideration and understanding of their consequences (see general requirements under ‘A coherent and logical narrative’ above). Depending on the nature of a particular qualification, there may also be additional areas that require focus. Similarly, some areas covered in the table may require more extended focus, while other areas may not be applicable.</p>

<p>Assessment strategies should refer, as appropriate, to the proposed or existing assessment materials (for example, questions, tasks and mark schemes) to exemplify any points or arguments made within the document. Assessment strategies should also refer, as appropriate, to existing policies or procedures to support the awarding organisation in demonstrating how it will seek to ensure that the qualification meets the requirements in the Conditions in relation to assessments (for example, Centre Assessment Standards Scrutiny strategies).</p>

<h5>Section 1: Qualification Purpose</h5>

<p>This refers to the initial approach to scoping the specification, including clearly defining the purposes of the assessment.</p>

      <td>Key aspects of the qualification, including the content and assessment structure, must be designed to be consistent with the qualification purpose. <br><br>A clear purpose will ensure that users of the qualification are not misled.<br><br>A qualification typically has a number of different purposes that it is seeking to fulfil. When defining the purposes of a qualification, awarding organisations should consider them from different perspectives. These include the following:<br><br> • The use to which the qualification outcomes will be put. The results of a qualification are likely to be used in different ways by a range of potential users. For example, results for individual learners may be used to identify appropriateness for recruitment to employment or further study, to signify licence to practise, and/or by the learner to make decisions regarding their own future. Results may also be used in aggregate from across learners. For example, results may be combined across learners taking qualifications within a centre for measures used to hold that centre to account.<br><br> • The expertise that learners will acquire through participation in the qualification, and the nature of that expertise. For example, a qualification may develop understanding of a broad body of knowledge, skills and understanding in a particular area, or it may support the mastery of specified skills relevant to a defined discipline. <br><br> • The role participation in the qualification plays in engaging learners. The existence of a qualification and the assessment(s) it contains will play a role in engaging learners. That may be engaging learners in education or training in general or be in relation to the specific area to which the qualification is relevant. For example, some qualifications may have the specific purpose of seeking to (re)engage learners likely to have particular previous experiences or reflect a particular context within which the qualification will be encountered.<br><br>Defining the purposes of a qualification in these terms, and considering their relative importance – including in terms of any intended priority order set out by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education – is likely to aid an effective qualification design process by informing the range of trade-offs required when making design decisions. These trade-offs and design decisions should be documented in the assessment strategy.</td>

<h2>Assessment requirements</h2>

<p>Condition ATQ5.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the assessment of Alternative Academic and Alternative Technical Qualifications.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition ATQ5.1 below.</p>

<p>We also set out the requirements in relation to which an awarding organisation may apply for an exemption under Condition ATQ5.2.</p>

<h3>Requirements for Alternative Academic qualifications</h3>

<h4>Assessment by Examination</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the assessments for an Alternative Academic Qualification include one or more Assessments by Examination<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> through which at least 40% of the contribution to the overall qualification grade is made available.</p>

<p>In each academic year, an awarding organisation must provide up to two assessment series on set dates during which Learners can complete the Assessment(s) by Examination for an Alternative Academic Qualification.</p>

<p>An awarding organisation may apply for an exemption to the requirement that the Assessment by Examination is taken simultaneously by all Learners. Where it applies for such an exemption, it may also apply for an exemption to the requirement to provide up to two assessment series on set dates. However, an awarding organisation may not apply for an exemption to the assessment series requirement where it is not also applying for an exemption to the requirement that the Assessment by Examination is taken simultaneously by Learners.</p>

<p>Any exemption to the requirements above will be only granted where an awarding organisation is able to demonstrate to Ofqual’s satisfaction that –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) its alternative assessment approach will improve the Validity of the qualification, and</li>
  <li>(b) the controls which it proposes to put in place are sufficient to manage any risks to which its alternative approach gives rise.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Non-exam Assessments</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must set all assessments for an Alternative Academic Qualification which are not Assessments by Examination (‘Non-exam Assessments’).</p>

<p>An awarding organisation may permit a Centre to adapt questions or tasks in Non-exam Assessments for the purpose of making those assessments more accessible to Learners.</p>

<p>In each academic year, an awarding organisation must provide up to two deadlines for the submission of proposed marks (or, where approved, grades) in relation to any Non-exam Assessment marked by Centres.</p>

<h4>Retaking Non-exam Assessments</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation may allow a Learner to retake a Non-exam Assessment for an Alternative Academic Qualification through submission, in a new or revised form, of evidence generated by that Learner which he or she has submitted for the purposes of taking the assessment on a previous occasion.</p>

<h4>Marking of assessments</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that evidence generated by Learners in the Assessments by Examination for an Alternative Academic Qualification is marked by the awarding organisation or a person connected to it.</p>

<p>Evidence generated by a Learner in a Non-exam Assessment for an Alternative Academic Qualification may be marked –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) by the awarding organisation or a person connected to the awarding organisation,</li>
  <li>(b) by a Centre, or</li>
  <li>(c) through a combination of (a) and (b).</li>
</ol>

<p>In any event, the awarding organisation must demonstrate to Ofqual’s satisfaction in its assessment strategy that –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) it has taken all reasonable steps to identify the risk of any Adverse Effect which may result from its approach to marking the assessments (and to Moderation where appropriate), and</li>
  <li>(b) where such a risk is identified, it has taken all reasonable steps to prevent that Adverse Effect or, where it cannot be prevented, to mitigate that Adverse Effect.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Qualification purposes for Alternative Academic Qualifications</h2>

<p>Condition ATQ8.2(a) allows us to specify requirements in relation to the general purposes which an Alternative Academic Qualification must meet, as well as how the qualification’s general and specific purposes must be balanced.</p>

<p>We set out our requirements for the purposes of Condition ATQ8.2(a) below.</p>

<h3>General purposes</h3>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that each Alternative Academic Qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, meets the following general purposes –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) Providing Users of the qualification with reliable evidence to differentiate between Learners’ attainment in relation to the knowledge, skills and understanding assessed as part of the qualification and, in particular, supporting decisions regarding the selection of Learners for further study (General Purpose A).</li>
  <li>(b) Providing an engaging course of learning for, while being accessible to, both Learners in full-time education and those studying part-time (General Purpose B).</li>
  <li>(c) Providing Learners with knowledge and understanding of theoretical content, and the skills required to apply it in a range of contexts, preparing them for progression into higher education (General Purpose C).</li>
  <li>(d) Providing a basis for schools and colleges to be held accountable for the performance of their Learners (General Purpose D).</li>
  <li>(e) Either –
    <ol>
      <li>(i) is likely to be the sole element of a Learner’s programme of study or the majority qualification that forms the core element of a Learner’s programme of study (General Purpose E(i)), or</li>
      <li>(ii) forms a substantial part of a Learner’s programme of study, typically delivered alongside a number of other qualifications in the case of a full-time Learner (General Purpose E(ii)).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the design of each Alternative Academic Qualification which it makes available, or proposes to make available, if there are potential trade-offs to be made between the general purposes, an awarding organisation must –</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) give priority to the general purposes in accordance with their hierarchy, with the greatest priority being given to compliance with purposes further up the hierarchy, and</li>
  <li>(b) without prejudice to the above requirement, secure compliance with all of the purposes to the greatest extent possible.</li>
</ol>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
  <p>
    For the purposes of these requirements an Assessment by Examination is defined as an assessment which is:<br><br>(a) set by an awarding organisation,<br> (b) designed to be taken simultaneously by all relevant Learners at a time determined by the awarding organisation, and<br>(c) taken under conditions specified by the awarding organisation (including conditions relating to the supervision of Learners during the assessment and the duration of the assessment).<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>
