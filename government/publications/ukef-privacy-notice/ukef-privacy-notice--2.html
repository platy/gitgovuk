  <li>accurate and kept up to date</li>
  <li>kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about</li>

When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.</p>

<h4>1.6&nbsp;Automated decision making</h4>

<p>UKEF does not currently undertake any automated decision making of personal data.</p>

<h4>1.7&nbsp;Data security</h4>
