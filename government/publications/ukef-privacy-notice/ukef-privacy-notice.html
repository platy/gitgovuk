<p>Updated 17 February 2022</p>

<p>This notice sets out how “we” (UK Export Finance) will use your personal data, and your rights in relation to our data policy. It is written in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).</p>

<p>It relates to all the purposes for which we may hold your personal data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Data protection principles</h2>

<p>We will comply with the principles under data protection law. These say that the personal information we hold about you must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way</li>
  <li>collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes</li>
  <li>relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes</li>
  <li>accurate and kept up to date</li>
  <li>kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about</li>
  <li>kept securely</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Your data</h2>

<p>Depending on the purpose, we will process (collect and use) personal data from the following list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>job title</li>
  <li>contact details including email address, phone number and address</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>date of birth, sex, age and biographical details</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>Your personal data will be collected and kept in order for us to carry out our functions as a government department and export credit agency. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>processing applications for our support and delivering our services</li>
  <li>providing customer service and support</li>
  <li>promoting our services including providing information and delivering events to you</li>
  <li>gathering feedback to improve our services</li>
  <li>training our staff</li>
  <li>staff recruitment</li>
  <li>carrying out public consultations</li>
  <li>dealing with complaints</li>

  <li>crime prevention including financial crime compliance</li>
  <li>supplier management</li>
  <li>enabling internal processes to carry out our operational activity related to our public task</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Legal basis of processing</h3>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is: processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Data sharing</h3>

<p>We may share personal information within our business. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to access it.</p>

<p>We may share your personal data with other government departments, agencies, public bodies, trade bodies, devolved administrations and third-party service providers where it is lawful to do so, when it supports a public task and/or for the purpose of trade promotion and delivery of our services.</p>

<p>We will not sell or share your data with third parties for their marketing purposes. Where we engage in email marketing to businesses, your consent on marketing preferences will be sought.</p>

<p>There are some cases where we can pass on your data without telling you – for example, to prevent or detect crime. In all cases, whether data is shared internally or externally, we will be governed by data protection law.</p>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT infrastructure it will also be shared with our data processors who provide services to us. In some instances, it will also be shared with our data processor who provides us with a customer relationship management system.</p>

<p>A small proportion of our records are transferred to The National Archives, in line with legal obligations for the collection, disposal and preservation of records. The Public Records Act governs the selection, transfer and preservation of records and requires those defined as public records to be openly accessible unless exempt under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Personal data obtained from other sources</h3>

<p>Other Government departments may provide us with your personal data where they have a lawful basis to do so and in order for us to carry out our functions as a government department and pursuant to the purposes set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#purpose">Purpose</a> above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Retention</h3>

<p>We aim to retain your personal data for only as long as it is necessary for us to do so for the purposes for which we are using it, provided that there is no other specified legal requirement or valid business reason for its retention. When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will delete or anonymise it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Automated decision making</h3>

<p>UKEF does not currently undertake any automated decision making of personal data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Recipients</h3>

<p>We may share personal data within our organisation or with other bodies where we are permitted to do so by law. This includes sharing information with the Department for International Trade and other government departments for the purpose of trade promotion and delivery of our services. There are some cases where we can pass on your data without telling you – for example, to prevent or detect crime. In all cases, whether data is shared internally or externally, we will be governed by data protection law.</p>

<p>As your personal data will be stored on our IT infrastructure it will also be shared with our data processors who provide email and document management and storage services to us. In some instances it will also be shared with our data processor who provides us with a customer relationship management system.</p>

<p>A small proportion of our records are transferred to The National Archives, in line with legal obligations for the collection, disposal and preservation of records. The Public Records Act governs the selection, transfer and preservation of records and requires those defined as public records to be openly accessible unless exempt under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>UKEF does not currently undertake any automated decision making of personal data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span>Data security</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Your rights</h2>

<p>Under the UK GDPR, you have several rights in respect of your information and the way we use it:</p>
