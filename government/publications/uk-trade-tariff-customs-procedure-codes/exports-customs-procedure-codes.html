<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Customs procedure codes notes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Restricted goods</h3>

<p>The use of the following Customs Procedure Codes (<abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr>) does not remove the need to comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-export-prohibitions-and-restrictions">export licensing requirements or other export prohibitions or restrictions</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, examination of controlled drugs subject to Home Office licensing requirements will not be undertaken at trader’s premises. Examination will be carried out at ship’s side only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) goods</h3>

<p>The use of the following <abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr> does not relieve any requirements applying to the export of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods. Failure to comply with the requirements may lead to prohibition of the export, loss of security and loss of entitlement to export refund and, or MCA payment.</p>

<p>Full details of the requirements are given in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-800-common-agricultural-policy-export-procedures">Notice 800: Common Agricultural Policy export procedures</a>.</p>

<p>When <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods are pre-entered on a Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) under any of the following <abbr title="Customs Procedure Codes">CPCs</abbr>, unless otherwise stated:</p>

<p>Form C88 <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> must be presented with the copy 2 <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> export declaration for all <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which are subject to a charge at export (for example, cereal export tax)</li>
  <li>which are subject to mandatory <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> export licensing</li>
  <li>which are subject to certain production aid (for example peas)</li>
  <li>on which a claim to export refund is being made</li>
  <li>security for export charges must be lodged at the place of export unless a guarantee to cover these charges has been given to the Intervention Board</li>
  <li>if the goods are subject to <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> export licensing, the licence must be lodged with the copy 2 <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> export declaration on which the number of the licence has been entered in box 44 unless the licence has been lodged with the Intervention Board beforehand</li>
  <li>any additional documentation needed must be submitted with the copy 2 of the <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>additional requirements specific to the <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods exported must also be complied with</li>
</ul>

<p>For exports by traders approved as <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> schedulers form C88 <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> is not needed in certain specified circumstances. Special rules apply to <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> schedulers and these are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-800-common-agricultural-policy-export-procedures">Notice 800</a>.</p>

<p>If evidence of export is not obtained within the specified time limit then the supply must not be zero-rated.</p>

<p>For full details on VAT time limits for exports and zero rating see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-703-export-of-goods-from-the-uk">Notice 703</a>.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>Goods imported into the UK and EU are in free circulation in the UK and EU if all import formalities have been completed and all duties, levies or equivalent charges have been paid and not refunded. Goods originating in the EU are also in free circulation.</p>

<p>For goods not declared electronically under the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>) <abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr> copies 2 and 3, and where needed <abbr title="Community Transit">CT</abbr> documents, must be lodged with the National Clearance Hub (<abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) where Customs Input Entry (<abbr title="Customs Input Entry">CIE</abbr>) facilities exist for the submission of export entries to Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>).</p>

<p>The export declaration and <abbr title="Community Transit">CT</abbr> documents will not be accepted until the goods have been presented to customs.</p>

<p>Merchandise in Baggage are commercial or business goods you take with you in your accompanied baggage or in your private vehicle, that are over £900 and less than <abbr title="kilograms">1,000kg</abbr>.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arrive well before your scheduled departure time</li>
  <li>present the goods to the export officer at the airport, port of departure together with a copy of the completed customs export declaration which should include the Movement Reference Number (<abbr title="Movement Reference Number">MRN</abbr>) allocated by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If an officer is not in attendance you must use the red phone at the export point to speak to an officer and follow the instructions given.</p>

<h4>Unique consignment reference number (<abbr title="Unique Consignment reference">UCR</abbr>)</h4>

<p>There are 2 main types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declaration unique consignment reference (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment reference">DUCR</abbr>)</li>
  <li>master <abbr title="Unique Consignment reference">UCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment reference">MUCR</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Every <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> declaration will have a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> whilst MUCRs are used either to identify a consignment to a means of transport (air) or to group together co-loaded consignments (maritime). The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment reference">DUCR</abbr> consists of up to 35 (alpha, numeric) characters and is split into 4 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>part 1 – the year in which the <abbr title="Unique Consignment reference">UCR</abbr> was allocated, (2008 would equal 8)</li>
  <li>part 2 – the country code for the country in which the <abbr title="Unique Consignment reference">UCR</abbr> was allocated, (Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would be GB)</li>
  <li>part 3 – the identity of the authorised trader (trader’s <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification scheme">EORI</abbr> number) followed by a hyphen ‘-’</li>
  <li>part 4 – a series of characters that are unique to the trader (providing an audit trail through their commercial accounting system)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4>Post export action</h4>

<p>For movements under an <abbr title="electronic Administrative Document">eAD</abbr>, discharge of the movement will be achieved when the dispatching warehouse keeper has received a report of export issued by HMRC through the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>).</p>

<p>For direct exports using simplified movements (see additional documents needed and security needed) the movement is discharged when the dispatching warehouse keeper holds commercial evidence of exports showing <abbr title="Import Clearance Status code">ICS</abbr> code 62.</p>

<p>Guarantors should be aware that until the movement is discharged their liability for the excise duty remains.</p>

<h4>VAT</h4>

<p>Documentary evidence of export is needed to support a claim to VAT zero rating. The UK supplier must ensure that they obtain and keep official or commercial evidence for all consignments.</p>

<p>If evidence of export is not obtained within the specified period then the supply must not be zero-rated.</p>

<p>For full details on VAT time limits for exports and zero rating see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-703-export-of-goods-from-the-uk">Notice 703</a>.</p>
