</ul>

<p>Re-imported goods where the importer is a VAT registered person importing the goods in the course of his business - VAT must be paid at importation and details included on the VAT certificate as appropriate unless the following conditions for claiming relief are satisfied.</p>

<p>The conditions require that the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>were last exported outside the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by or on behalf of the importer who is a taxable person reimporting the goods in the course of his business</li>
  <li>have not been subjected to any process or repair outside the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, other than necessary running repairs, which have increased their export value</li>
  <li>were owned by the importer at the time of exportation and have remained his property or were so owned and have been returned after rejection by a customer outside the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or because it was not possible to deliver them to such customer, or have been returned from the continental shelf</li>

<h4>Post clearance action</h4>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>The importer must be authorised for end use relief covering the goods for which relief is claimed.</p>

<p>Where both returned goods relief and end-use relief are claimed ie when re-imported goods are to be put to the same end use as in the previous importation  and the end-use relief previously given was at a reduced rate of duty which was paid and not refunded the goods must be entered under normal end-use relief. Enter in the additional information box code A1=Gen 03 and DTA in the rate column of box 47.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> must not be used to claim shipwork end use relief (<abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> 40 00 023).</p>

<p>For end use goods entered to excise warehousing for Excise Duty purposes see <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> 07 40 000.</p>

<p>You may only claim end use relief if you are an individual, partnerships or corporate body established within the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, acting on your own behalf or representing a UK or non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> body. Registration for VAT or <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr> does not necessarily imply establishment.</p>

<p>Civil aircraft imported into the UK from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for care, maintenance or repair may be entered to end use relief where the organisation undertaking the process holds a valid end use authorisation.</p>

<p>The declaration completion requirements will vary dependent on if the person to whom the aircraft is consigned is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> -</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If the consignee is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and authorised for end use relief, their details including their <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr> should be entered on the declaration as the consignee.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the consignee is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but not authorised for end use, the details of the UK consignees <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr>, name and address must be entered in box 8 of the C88. The end use authorised organisation carrying out the care, maintenance or repair must be entered in box 14 of the C88 (if they are also the declarant) and their authorisation number entered in box 44.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the consignee is not established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> the details (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr> number, name and address) of the end use authorised organisation carrying out the care, maintenance or repair must be entered in boxes 8 (and 14 if they are also the declarant) of the C88 and their authorisation number entered in box 44. It’s expected that in these instances the aircraft will be exported following the care etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Importation of civil aircraft for transport purposes - where civil aircraft are imported into the UK for transport purposes, that is, not for care, maintenance or repair, by persons not established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, End Use relief cannot be used.</p>

<p>Where the aircraft is being imported for transport purposes and the consignee is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> it may be entered to end use relief subject to the consignee holding a valid end use authorisation or claims the relief using simplified end use.</p>

<p>However in order to be eligible for simplified end use the consignee of the aircraft must be entered in box 8, be established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the place where the goods are to be put to the prescribed end use must be in the UK.</p>

<p>You cannot enter an aircraft to another End Use authorisation where that holder of that authorisation is merely facilitating the import and has no involvement in what happens to the aircraft after importation.</p>

<p>An aircraft that carries a civil registration upon import does not complete end use.</p>

<p>Any guarantee will be released upon receipt and checking of the Bill of Discharge BOD2. Goods free of customs duty cannot claim end-use relief.</p>

<p>In order to claim the relief the importer must wholly assign the goods to the prescribed end-use.</p>

<p>Involve only UK customs.</p>

<p>Transfer of goods to other persons, authorised or otherwise is not allowable under this <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr>.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> must not be used to claim simplified shipwork end-use (see <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> 40 00 029).</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> must only be used for civil aircraft, aircraft engines and occasional importations. It must not be used as a regular means of importation.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr> is not to be used for goods entered under Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (<abbr title="Customs Freight Simplified Procedures">CFSP</abbr>).</p>

<p>You may only claim end use relief if you are an individual, partnerships or corporate body established within the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, acting on your own behalf or representing a UK or non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> body. Registration for VAT or <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr> does not necessarily imply establishment.</p>

<p>Civil aircraft imported into the UK from outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for care, maintenance or repair may be entered to end use relief where the organisation undertaking the process holds a valid End Use authorisation. The declaration completion requirements will vary dependent on if the person to whom the aircraft is consigned is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the consignee is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and authorised for end use relief, their details including their <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr> should be entered on the declaration as the consignee.</p>

<p>If the consignee is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> but not authorised for End Use, the details of the UK consignees <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr>, name and address must be entered in box 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-single-administrative-document-c88-status">C88</a>.

<p>Where the consignee is not established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> the details (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration number">EORI</abbr> number, name and address) of the end use authorised organisation carrying out the care, maintenance or repair must be entered in boxes 8 (and 14 if they are also the declarant) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-single-administrative-document-c88-status">C88</a> and their authorisation number entered in box 44. It’s expected that in these instances the aircraft will be exported following the care etc.</p>

<h5>Importation of civil aircraft for transport purposes</h5>

<p>Where civil aircraft are imported into the UK for transport purposes, that is, not for care, maintenance or repair, by persons not established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, end use relief can not be used.</p>

<p>Where the aircraft is being imported for transport purposes and the consignee is established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> it may be entered to end use relief subject to the consignee holding a valid end use authorisation or claims the relief using simplified end use.</p>

<p>However in order to be eligible for simplified end use the consignee of the aircraft must be entered in box 8, be established in the UK or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the place where the goods are to be put to the prescribed end use must be in the UK.</p>

<p>You cannot enter an aircraft to another end use authorisation where that holder of that authorisation is merely facilitating the import and has no involvement in what happens to the aircraft after importation.</p>

<p>An aircraft that carries a civil registration upon import does not complete end use.</p>

<p>The guarantee will be release upon receipt and checking of the Bill of Discharge BoD4.</p>

<p>No goods over the value of £500,000 may be entered to this <abbr title="Customs procedure codes">CPC</abbr>.</p>
