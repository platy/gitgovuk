<h4>Security needed</h4>

<p>A movement guarantee is needed to cover the movement from the place of release to free circulation to the tax warehouse of receipt. This guarantee is detailed in the appropriate field on the <abbr title="export accompanying document">e-AD</abbr> prepared by the Registered Consignor.</p>

<p>Security is needed before the production of any documents needed to confirm the <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> relief claim.</p>

<h4>Additional information</h4>

<p>Only import agents or receiving warehousekeepers, once approved as a Registered Consignor, will be allowed to start Excise Duty suspended movements within the <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> system from the place of release to free circulation to an excise warehouse.</p>

<p>To start the duty suspended movement the Registered Consignor must have made the customs declaration to free circulation for the goods or is the receiving warehousekeeper.</p>

<p>This means you must have this connection with the goods. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196</a> for information on becoming approved as a Registered Consignor.</p>

<p>These movements will need to be cover by a movement guarantee and the guarantee must be provided by either the Registered Consignor, the owner of the goods or the transporter. It is the responsibility of a Registered Consignor to ensure that the guarantee requirements are fully met before a movement starts.</p>

<p>Full detail on movement guarantees and the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>) can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<p>Where release for removal to the excise warehouse is allowed against security before production of documents listed in section 4, they must be presented within 28 days.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>Entry to this <abbr title="Custom Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> is:</p>
