<p>‘I declare that the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are not <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, or goods manufactured from <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods</li>
  <li>were in free circulation when previously exported from the customs territory of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Turkey, San Marino and Andorra</li>
  <li>are being entered for free circulation within 3 years (6 years for diplomatic, consular/embassy staff and armed forces) of them being exported from that territory (<a class="govuk-link" href="#if-waiver">see below</a> if longer than 3 years)</li>
  <li>have not undergone any process or repair outside that territory other than routine maintenance to keep them in good condition, or handling which only altered the goods appearance, for example attaching operating instructions in foreign languages</li>
</ul>

<p>If I am claiming <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> relief, I further declare that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods were exported from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> by me or on my behalf</li>
  <li>any <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due on the goods was paid and not refunded on export from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> or <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> If I am claiming Excise Duty relief, I further declare that:

<p>Where release is allowed against security before production of documents, they must be presented within 28 days.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>The use of this <abbr title="Custom Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> is a declaration by the importer in the following terms:</p>

<p>‘I declare that the goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are being imported by a registered taxable person in the course of a zero rated supply of these goods by the importer to a taxable person in another member state, and that the goods will be removed from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> within one month of the date of importation,</li>
  <li>are not <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, or goods manufactured from <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> good</li>

  <li>are being entered for free circulation within 3 years (6 years for diplomatic, consular/embassy staff and armed forces) of them being exported from that territory (<a class="govuk-link" href="#if-waiver-of">see below</a> if longer than 3 years)</li>
  <li>have not undergone any process or repair outside that territory  other than routine maintenance to keep them in good condition, or handling which only altered the goods appearance, for example attaching of operating instructions in foreign languages</li>
</ul>

<p>If I am claiming Excise Duty relief, I further declare that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods were previously exported from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Excise Duty has been paid in full on the goods and not subsequently refunded</li>
  <li>any excise drawback or allowance obtained at export is being repaid against this declaration’</li>
</ul>

<p>This <abbr title="Custom Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> is only to be used for non <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods in free circulation at the time of export from the customs territory of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, Turkey, San Marino and Andorra, and where the goods have not undergone any process or repair outside that territory except as detailed in the first declaration in the ‘Notes’ section.</p>

<p>Otherwise, entry must be made to another appropriate <abbr title="Custom Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> in the 61 series. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief">Notice 236: Returned Goods Relief</a>, Section 9 defines what is meant by ‘Goods in free circulation’.</p>

<p>If waiver of the 3 year time limit for reimportation is claimed due to special circumstances, insert ‘Waiver of time limit claimed’ in Box 44 as a GEN 03 <abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr> Statement. This waiver must be shown to be reasonable to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> when requested.</p>

<h4>Security needed</h4>

<p>A movement guarantee is needed to cover the movement from the place of release to free circulation to the tax warehouse of receipt. This guarantee is detailed in the appropriate field on the <abbr title="export accompanying document">e-AD</abbr> prepared by the Registered Consignor.</p>

<p>Security is needed before the production of any documents needed to confirm the <abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr> relief claim.</p>

<h4>Additional information</h4>

<p>Only import agents or receiving warehousekeepers, once approved as a Registered Consignor, will be allowed to start Excise Duty suspended movements within the <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> system from the place of release to free circulation to an excise warehouse.</p>

<p>To start the duty suspended movement the Registered Consignor must have made the customs declaration to free circulation for the goods or is the receiving warehousekeeper.</p>

<p>This means you must have this connection with the goods. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196</a> for information on becoming approved as a Registered Consignor.</p>

<p>These movements will need to be cover by a movement guarantee and the guarantee must be provided by either the Registered Consignor, the owner of the goods or the transporter. It is the responsibility of a Registered Consignor to ensure that the guarantee requirements are fully met before a movement starts.</p>

<p>Full detail on movement guarantees and the Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>) can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods">Notice 197</a>.</p>

<h4><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr></h4>

<p>Where relief from <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is claimed, the original exporter and the person now re-importing the goods and claiming relief must be the same.</p>

<h4>Post clearance action</h4>

<p>Where release for removal to the excise warehouse is allowed against security before production of documents listed in section 4, they must be presented within 28 days.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>Entry to this <abbr title="Custom Procedure Code">CPC</abbr> is:</p>
