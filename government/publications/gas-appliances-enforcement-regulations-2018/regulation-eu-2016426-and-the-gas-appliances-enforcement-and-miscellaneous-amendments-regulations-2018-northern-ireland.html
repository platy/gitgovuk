<p><strong>Guidance on the regulations as they apply to appliances being supplied in or into Northern Ireland.</strong></p>

<p>May 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This Guide is for businesses placing gas appliances or fittings on the market in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>While the Northern Ireland Protocol <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-1">see footnote 1</a> (‘the Protocol’) is in force <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-2">see footnote 2</a>, Northern Ireland (“NI”) is aligning with relevant EU rules relating to the placing on the market of manufactured goods. Gas appliances and fittings placed on the NI market must therefore follow UK law as it applies to NI. The relevant law is Regulation EU 2016/426 on appliances burning gaseous fuels and the Gas Appliances (Enforcement) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2018 which apply across the UK but some of their provisions apply differently in NI.</p>

<p>Regulation (EU) 2016/426 sets out the essential requirements which must be met before appliances or fittings burning gaseous fuels can be placed on the NI market. The Gas Appliances (Enforcement) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2018 provides for the enforcement of Regulation 2016/426 in the UK.</p>

<p>The purpose of the legislation is to protect consumers and other end-users from unsafe products by requiring manufacturers to show how their products meet the ‘essential requirements’. The aim of Regulation EU 2016/426 is to set out requirements for the design and manufacture of appliances or fittings burning gaseous fuels to ensure the health and safety of users, domestic animals and property.</p>

<p>This guide is designed to help you comply with Regulation 2016/426 and the Gas Appliances (Enforcement) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2018 (referred to in this document collectively as the “Amended Gas Appliances Regulations” and individually the “2016 Regulation” and the “2018 Regulations” respectively).</p>

<p>From 16 July 2021, the EU Regulation on Market Surveillance 2019/1020 (referred to as “MSC” in this document) replaces the market surveillance provisions in the Regulation on Accreditation and Market Surveillance 765/2008. For the duration of the Protocol, EU rules on goods apply in Northern Ireland, including MSC which will be directly applicable in NI and applies in addition to the 2016 Regulation. MSC does not apply in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Article 4 of MSC requires that an economic operator responsible for compliance must be based in the EU (or NI) in order to lawfully place certain products on the market, including gas appliances and fittings. This responsible economic operator must fulfil certain compliance tasks. This Guide summarises key requirements of Article 4, but detailed guidance is available.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/placing-certain-products-on-the-northern-ireland-market">Read guidance on placing certain products on the Northern Ireland market</a></p>

<p>Gas appliances and fittings placed on the Great Britain (“GB”) market (GB comprises England, Scotland and Wales) must follow the separate rules for the GB market.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gas-appliances-enforcement-regulations-2018">Read guidance on the regulations in Great Britain</a></p>

<p>The government committed to providing unfettered access for qualifying NI goods to the rest of the UK market after 1 January 2021. Gas appliances and fittings that can be placed on the NI market in accordance with the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations, as they apply to NI, can be sold in the rest of the UK without any additional approvals. The arrangements here are explained in detail in the separate guidance for placing gas appliances and fittings on the market in GB.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Legislative Background</h2>

<p>The 2016 Regulation on appliances burning gaseous fuels – the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0426" rel="external">Gas Appliances Regulation 2016</a> – was adopted on 9 March 2016 and entered into force on 21 April 2018, replacing the previous Directive 2009/142/EC.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulation was directly applicable from 21 April 2018. The enforcement and sanctions approach were implemented into UK law by the 2018 Regulations (SI 2018 No. 389). The 2018 Regulations replaced the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations 1995 (“1995 Regulations”) for gas appliances and fittings placed on the market on or after 21 April 2018.</p>

<p>The 2018 Regulations were amended by The Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and The Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (UK(NI) Indication) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 to give effect to the Protocol as it relates to the placing on the NI market of gas appliances and fittings. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-3">See footnote 3</a></p>

<p>There is therefore one set of UK 2018 Regulations, but some of the provisions apply differently in NI and GB. References to the 2018 Regulations in this guidance are references to those Regulations as they apply in NI.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulation will continue to have direct effect in NI after the Transition Period as a result of the Protocol.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>The 2016 Regulation applies to gas appliances and fittings.</p>

<p>(1)	The 2016 Regulation applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appliances burning gaseous fuels used for cooking, refrigeration, air conditioning, space heating, hot water production, lighting or washing and also forced draught burners and heating bodies to be equipped with such burners</li>
  <li>
    <p>fittings which are regulating, controlling and safety devices and sub-assemblies thereof intended to be incorporated into appliances or assembled to constitute appliances
(2)	The 2016 Regulation does not apply to appliances specifically designed:</p>
  </li>
  <li>for use in industrial processes carried out on industrial premises</li>
  <li>for use on aircrafts and railways</li>
  <li>for research purposes for temporary use in laboratories</li>
</ul>

<p>An appliance is considered to be ‘specifically designed’ when the design is only intended to address a specific need for a specific process or use.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulation does not apply to gas appliances and fittings placed on the EEA market before 21 April 2018 such products remain regulated under the 1995 Regulations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Requirements</h2>

<h3>The 2016 Regulation</h3>

<p>The essential requirements listed in Annex I of the 2016 Regulation apply to gas appliances and fittings as appropriate. All gas appliances and fittings within scope must undergo a conformity assessment procedure set out in Article 14 to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements.</p>

<h3>MSC</h3>

<h3>Responsible economic operator</h3>

<p>If a gas appliance or fitting is offered for sale or supply to NI (or EU) consumers, it is considered to be placed on the EEA market. Article 4 requires that a responsible economic operator must be based in NI (or the EU) to carry out certain compliance tasks in respect of that appliance or fitting. This can be the manufacturer, an importer, a manufacturer’s authorised representative, or a fulfilment service. They must carry out the compliance tasks in Article 4 and their contact details must be indicated on the product or on its packaging, the parcel or an accompanying document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Obligations of manufacturers</h2>

<h3>The 2016 Regulation</h3>

<p>A manufacturer is a person who has a gas appliance or fitting designed or manufactured, and markets that gas appliance or fitting under their name or trademark or uses the appliance or fitting for their own purpose.</p>

<p>The obligations of manufacturers of gas appliances and fittings include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before placing gas appliances or fittings on the NI market or when using for their own purposes, a manufacturer must ensure that it has been designed and manufactured in accordance with the applicable essential requirements. These are set out in Annex I to the 2016 Regulation. They must also have a relevant conformity assessment procedure carried out and technical documentation drawn up.</li>
  <li>Once this has been done a manufacturer must draw up an EU Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE marking visibly, legibly and indelibly to the to the gas appliance or the fitting or its data plate. Where it is not possible or warranted, on account of the nature of the appliance or fitting, to affix the CE marking to the appliance or fitting, it must be affixed to the packaging and the accompanying documents.</li>
  <li>When conformity assessment has been carried out by a UK notified body, the UKNI marking (also known as the UK(NI) indication) must be affixed as well as the CE marking. This product can then be placed on the NI market but it cannot be placed on the EEA market. There is separate guidance on when and how to use the UKNI marking. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a>
</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must keep the EU Declaration of Conformity up to date and must keep it and the technical documentation for 10 years after their gas appliance or the fitting has been placed on the NI market.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must ensure that procedures are in place for series production to remain in conformity. When deemed appropriate having assessed the risk they must carry out sample testing, keep a register of complaints, and keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer must ensure that all gas appliances and fittings placed on the NI market bears a type and serial or batch number, the manufacturer’s name, registered trade name or registered trademark and postal address. Where the size or nature of the gas appliance or the fitting does not allow this, then it may be provided on the packaging or in an accompanying document.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer must ensure that the gas appliance is accompanied by instructions and safety information as set out in point 1.5 of Annex I to the 2016 regulation. The instructions must be clear, legible and in easily understandable English.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer must ensure that the fitting is accompanied by the EU Declaration of Conformity containing: instructions for incorporation or assembly, adjustment; operation and maintenance in accordance with point 1.7 of Annex I. The instructions must be clear, legible and in easily understandable English. However, where a large number of fittings are delivered to a single user, the batch or consignment concerned may be accompanied by a single copy of the EU Declaration of Conformity.</li>
  <li>Where the manufacturer believes that an appliance or fitting they have placed on the NI market is not in conformity, they must immediately take corrective measures to bring that appliance or fitting into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it if appropriate. They must also inform the enforcement authority of any corrective measures taken, and the competent authorities of any relevant state in which the manufacturer has made the appliance available on the market, of the risk. They must also co-operate with enforcement authorities and provide all necessary information and documentation to the NI enforcement authority following any requests. They must also cooperate with the enforcement authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by appliances or fittings which they have placed on the NI market. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MSC</h3>

<p>If a gas appliance or fitting is offered for sale or supply to NI (or EU) consumers, it is considered to be placed on the EEA market. Article 4 requires that a responsible economic operator must be based in NI (or the EU) to carry out certain compliance tasks in respect of that appliance or fitting. This can be the manufacturer, the importer, a manufacturer’s authorised representative, or a fulfilment service. The responsible economic operator must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Keep documentation:</strong> Verify that the EU declaration of conformity or declaration of performance and technical documentation have been drawn up, keep the declaration of conformity or declaration of performance at the disposal of market surveillance authorities for 10 years and ensure that the technical documentation can be made available to those authorities upon request.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Provide documentation:</strong> If a reasoned request is made by a market surveillance authority, provide them with all information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the product.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Notify risk:</strong> If there is reason to believe a product presents a risk, inform the market surveillance authority.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Cooperate:</strong> Cooperate with market surveillance authorities, including requests to take appropriate corrective action. If that is not possible, mitigate the risks presented by the product when they believe the product presents a risk or are requested to do so by the market surveillance authorities.</li>
</ol>

<p>The contact details of the responsible economic operator must be indicated on the product or on its packaging, the parcel or an accompanying document.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Obligations of authorised representatives</h2>

<p>A manufacturer can appoint an authorised representative to perform certain tasks on their behalf.</p>

<p>An authorised representative appointed by a manufacturer to represent him in either the NI or EEA markets cannot be based in GB. This means that GB based authorised representatives cannot carry out tasks on the manufacturer’s behalf for products being placed on the NI or European Economic Area (EEA) markets.</p>

<p>An authorised representative based in NI can, under the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations as they apply in NI, carry out tasks on the manufacturer’s behalf for products placed on the NI or EU markets.</p>

<p>The written mandate shall at least allow the authorised representative to perform the following tasks:</p>

<p>(a)	keeping the EU Declaration of Conformity and the technical documentation at the disposal of the national market surveillance authorities for 10 years after the gas appliance has been placed on the market</p>

<p>(b)	further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, providing that authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the gas appliance or fitting</p>

<p>(c)	cooperating with the competent national authorities, at their request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by appliances or fittings covered by the authorised representative’s mandate</p>

<p>An authorised representative must comply with all the duties imposed on the manufacturer under the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations that they are appointed by the manufacturer to perform. There are some duties that a manufacturer cannot mandate an authorised representative to perform (e.g. conformity assessment) and some that must form part of the authorised representatives mandate (e.g. retention of technical documentation).</p>

<p>A manufacturer remains responsible for the proper performance of any obligations the authorised representative performs on their behalf.</p>

<p>Any references in the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations to the manufacturer are to be taken to include a reference to the authorised representative including in relation to penalties for failure to comply with those duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Obligations of importers</h2>

<p>For the purposes of the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations as they apply in NI (under the Protocol), an importer is a business or person established in NI or the EEA who places an appliance or fitting from outside of the EEA or NI on the NI or EEA market. Therefore, a business or person based in Northern Ireland who is supplied with a product from GB will be an importer under the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations, if they then sell that product on the NI (or EEA) markets.</p>

<p>The obligations of importers include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before placing an <strong>appliance</strong> on the market, an importer must ensure that the appropriate conformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 14 have been carried out by the manufacturer. This means that the gas appliance must comply with the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the 2016 Regulation.</li>
  <li>The importer must ensure that the manufacturer has drawn up technical documentation; the gas appliance bears the CE marking and is accompanied by required documents and information in accordance with point 1.5 of Annex 1 and that the manufacturer has complied with the requirements set out in Article 7(5) and (6). When conformity assessment has been carried out by a UK notified body, the UKNI marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-4">see footnote 4</a> (also known as the UK(NI) indication) must be affixed as well as the CE marking.</li>
  <li>Before placing a <strong>fitting</strong> on the market, importers shall ensure that the appropriate conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 14 has been carried out by the manufacturer.</li>
  <li>The importer shall ensure that the manufacturer has drawn up the technical documentation, that the fitting bears the CE marking and is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity containing, inter alia, instructions for incorporation or assembly, adjustment, operation and maintenance in accordance with point 1.7 of Annex I, and that the manufacturer has complied with the requirements set out in Article 7(5) and (6) of the 2016 Regulation.</li>
  <li>When conformity assessment has been carried out by a UK notified body, the UK(NI) indication must be affixed as well as the CE marking. A product with the CE UKNI marking cannot then be placed on the market in the EU. There is separate guidance on when and how to use the UKNI marking. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a>
</li>
  <li>When deemed appropriate regarding the risk presented by an appliance or fitting, the importer must carry out sample testing of the appliances or fittings they have placed on the NI market, keep a register of complaints of non-conforming appliances and fittings and recalls of such appliances and fittings, and keep distributors informed of any such monitoring.</li>
  <li>Importers shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trademark and postal address on the relevant gas appliance or fitting. Where this is not possible it may be provided on the packaging or in an accompanying document.</li>
  <li>The contact details shall be in a language easily understood by appliance manufacturers and the market surveillance authorities. If the fitting is placed on the market in Northern Ireland, the language shall be in English</li>
  <li>The importer must keep a copy of the EU Declaration of Conformity and technical documentation for a period of 10 years after the gas appliance or the fitting has been placed on the NI market.</li>
  <li>The importer must ensure that gas appliances or fittings under their responsibility are safely stored and transported in such a way that does not jeopardise conformity with the essential requirements.</li>
  <li>Where the importer believes that an appliance or fitting they have placed on the NI market is not in conformity, they must immediately take corrective measures to bring that appliance or fitting into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it if appropriate. They must also inform the enforcement authority of any corrective measures taken, and the competent authorities of any relevant state in which the importer has made the appliance available on the market, of the risk. They must also co-operate with enforcement authorities and provide all necessary information and documentation to the NI enforcement authority following any requests. They must also cooperate with the enforcement authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by appliances or fittings which they have placed on the NI market. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
  <li>The importer must also cooperate with and provide information to enforcing authorities following any requests.

</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Obligations of distributors</h2>

<p>A distributor is any person, other than the manufacturer or importer, who makes appliances and fittings available on the NI market.</p>

<p>NI businesses which were distributors of gas appliances or fittings supplied to them from GB should now consider whether they are classified as importers under the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations and therefore what additional requirements they need to comply with – see section 7 above. Under the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations an NI business placing a product from GB on the NI market does so as an importer, not as a distributor under the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations.</p>

<p>The obligations of distributors include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before making a gas appliance or fittings available on the NI market, a distributor takes due care to ensure that it is in conformity with the 2016 Regulation.</li>
  <li>Before making an <strong>appliance</strong> available on the NI market, a distributor must ensure that it bears the CE marking (when conformity assessment has been carried out by a UK notified body, the UKNI marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-5">see footnote 5</a> (also known as the UK(NI) indication) must be affixed as well as the CE marking); is accompanied by a copy of the instructions and safety information in accordance with point 1.5 of Annex I that are clear, legible and in easily understandable English; and that the manufacturer and importer have complied with their obligations as to required labelling.</li>
  <li>Before making a <strong>fitting</strong> available on the market, distributors must ensure that the fitting bears the CE marking (when conformity assessment has been carried out by a UK notified body, the UKNI marking (also known as the UK(NI) indication) must be affixed as well as the CE marking) is accompanied by a copy of the EU Declaration of Conformity containing, among other things, instructions for incorporation or assembly, adjustment, operation and maintenance in accordance with point 1.7 of Annex I of the 2016 Regulation, in easily understandable English; and that the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the requirements as to required labelling.</li>
  <li>The distributor must ensure that gas appliances or the fittings under their responsibility are safely stored and transported in such a way that does not jeopardise its conformity with the essential requirements.</li>
  <li>Where they have reason to believe that the gas appliance or the fitting they have made available on the NI market are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulation, the distributor must make sure that the corrective measures necessary to bring that appliance or fitting into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate, are taken. Furthermore, where the appliance or the fitting presents a risk, distributors shall immediately inform the enforcement authority in NI to that effect, and the competent authorities of any relevant state in which the distributor has made the appliance available on the market, of the risk, giving details, in particular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective measures taken. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
  <li>Distributors must also cooperate with and provide all necessary information and documentation to the enforcement authority in NI following any requests. They must also cooperate with the enforcement authority, at its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by appliances or fittings which they have placed on the NI market.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">9.Transitional </span> arrangements</h2>

<h3>Products placed on the market before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you placed an individual fully manufactured product on the EEA or the UK market (either in NI or GB) before 1 January 2021, you do not need to take any additional action. These individual goods can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user and do not need to comply with the changes that took effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A fully manufactured good is ‘placed on the market’ when there is a written or verbal agreement (or offer of an agreement) to transfer ownership or possession or other rights in the product. This does not require physical transfer of the good.</p>

<p>You can usually provide proof of placing on the market on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contracts of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured and meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>documents concerning the shipping of goods for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) bears the burden of proof for demonstrating that the good was placed on the market before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Conformity Marking</h2>

<p>Where an appliance or fitting is being placed on the NI market, and the manufacturer chooses to have it conformity assessed by an EU recognised body, the marking for the NI and EEA markets continues to be the CE marking.</p>

<p>The CE marking can continue to be used for the GB market until 31 December 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-6">see footnote 6</a>, as long as all the other rules have been complied with. From 1 January 2023, the UKCA marking must be used for the GB market, but there are specific rules relating to unfettered access that apply for qualifying NI goods.</p>

<p>For qualifying NI goods, appliances and fittings meeting NI rules (the 2016 Regulations as they apply in NI), which are CE or both CE and UKNI marked, can be placed on the GB market from 1 January 2021 and on an ongoing basis thereafter (there is further information on the reasons for this below and this arrangement is explained further in the separate guide to placing appliances and fittings on the GB market).</p>

<p>Appliances and fittings that do not fall within the definition of qualifying Northern Ireland goods will need to meet the GB rules, including being UKCA marked, if placed on the GB market after 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, where the manufacturer chooses to have the appliance or fitting conformity assessed by a UK notified body, the CE marking must be accompanied by the UKNI marking (also known as the UK(NI) indication). Products with the UKNI marking cannot be placed on the EEA market.</p>

<p>There is separate guidance on when and how to use the UKNI marking.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Notified Bodies</h2>

<p>Notified Bodies are independent organisations notified to the European Commission to carry out the procedures for conformity assessment and certification set out in the 2016 Regulations.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, all UK Notified Bodies will remain Notified Bodies for the purpose of CE marking products for the NI market. When these UK bodies are used for mandatory conformity assessment activity, then the manufacturer will need to affix both the CE and UKNI markings. A product with both the CE and UKNI markings cannot then be placed on the market in the EEA. There is separate guidance on when and how to use the UKNI marking.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a></p>

<p>A list of EU Notified Bodies can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/" rel="external">NANDO website</a>. If a manufacturer uses a Notified Body from this list, then they apply only the CE marking to their product (not both the CE and UKNI markings).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-market-conformity-assessment-bodies">Access the list of UK Notified Bodies</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods</h2>

<p>The government committed to providing unfettered access for qualifying Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK market after 1 January 2021. Appliances and fittings that can be placed on the NI market in accordance with the 2016 Regulations, can be sold in the rest of the UK without any additional approvals. The guide to placing gas appliances and fittings on the GB market has further details on these arrangements.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/moving-qualifying-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-the-rest-of-the-uk">Read guidance on qualifying Northern Ireland goods</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Enforcement</h2>

<p>As set out in the 2018 Regulations for gas appliances intended for workplace use, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hseni.gov.uk/" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI)</a> has a duty to enforce the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations in NI.</p>

<p>In NI, district councils have a duty to enforce the Amended Gas Appliances Regulations in relation to consumer goods.</p>

<p>Where the gas appliances are intended to be used on nuclear sites, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.onr.org.uk/" rel="external">Office for Nuclear Regulation</a> has a duty to enforce these Regulations.</p>

<p>The 2018 Regulations provide the power to market surveillance authorities to take action against economic operators for gas appliances and fittings that present a risk or are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulation. There are requirements on economic operators to co-operate with the enforcement authority as appropriate on request.</p>

<p>The 2018 Regulations also provide powers to the Secretary of State to enforce the 2018 Regulations, the 2016 Regulation and RAMS (Regulation (EC 765/2008 which sets out requirements for market surveillance of products).</p>

<h3>Safeguard procedure</h3>

<p>Enforcement authorities are required under the 2016 Regulations to take all appropriate measures to withdraw from the NI market or to prohibit, and restrict the supply of products bearing CE Marking which may endanger the health and safety of persons, property or the environment if the relevant economic operator does not do so. Under the safeguard procedure, the UK must inform the European Commission and EU Member States immediately of any enforcement action taken indicating the reasons justifying the action. This will enable Member States to take action against similar products placed on the market on their territories. Similarly, if an EU Member State initiates the procedure with respect to action taken on their territories, certain actions are required of UK market surveillance authorities and the Secretary of State. The European Commission will determine whether the action taken is justified; if so, enforcement authorities must take necessary measures to ensure the appliance or fitting is withdrawn from the market.</p>

<h3>Regulators’ Code</h3>

<p>Market surveillance authorities must have regard to the Regulators’ Code when developing the policies and operational procedures that guide their regulatory activities in this area. They should carry out their activities in a way that supports those they regulate to comply and grow, including choosing proportionate approaches that reflect risk.</p>

<p>In responding to non-compliance that they identify, regulators should clearly explain what the non-compliant item or activity is, the advice being given, actions required or decisions taken, and the reasons for these. Unless immediate action is needed to prevent a serious breach, regulators should provide an opportunity for dialogue in relation to the advice, requirements or decisions, with a view to ensuring that they are acting in a way that is proportionate and consistent. The Secretary of State takes account of the provisions of both the Regulators’ Code and the Growth Duty in exercising his regulatory functions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Read the Regulators’ Code</a></p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>A person committing an offence under the 2018 Regulations may be liable to a penalty. Penalties can include a fine or a prison sentence of up to three months for the most serious offences or both. It is a matter for the enforcement authority to decide whether prosecution is appropriate in each case taking into account the circumstances of the case and the enforcement authorities’ own policies, operational procedures and practices in line with the Regulators Code. Should a prosecution take place, and the economic operator is found to be in breach, it is at the discretion of the court to decide the penalties imposed on the offender.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Glossary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Approved Body</strong> – A conformity assessment body which has been approved by the Secretary of State or was a UK ‘Notified Body’ prior to 1 January 2021 able to carry out conformity assessment of products with a view to UKCA marking. They are not recognised by the EU (unless they have a presence in the EU) and cannot approve CE marking.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Authorised Representative</strong> – A person appointed in writing by a manufacturer to perform specific tasks for the manufacturer. An authorised representative can be based anywhere in the EEA or NI. The authorised representative cannot be based in GB, in respect of products being supplied on the NI market. Manufacturers remain ultimately responsible for ensuring these tasks are carried out properly.</li>
  <li>
<strong>CE marking</strong> – the CE marking can be placed on products which have been conformity assessed by an EU Notified Body and are intended for the EU or NI markets. CE marked products can only be placed on the GB market until 31 December 2022, although special arrangements have been agreed to ensure NI’s unfettered access to the rest of the UK.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Distributor</strong> – Any person in the EEA or NI supply chains, other than the manufacturer or the importer, who makes a product available in the EEA or NI markets.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Enforcing Authority</strong> – In NI, for products in the use in the workplace, the enforcing authority is the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI). For products for private use it is district councils.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>EU Declaration of conformity</strong> – A document prepared by the manufacturer which must detail, amongst other things, the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the specific product to which the declaration is referring</li>
      <li>the name and address of the manufacturer and, where applicable, their authorised representative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This must be kept by the manufacturer for a period of ten years from the date on which the product was placed on the NI market. This declaration must be made available to the enforcing authority upon request.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Fulfilment service</strong> – A natural or legal person offering, in the course of commercial activity, at least two of the following services: warehousing, packaging, addressing and dispatching, without having ownership of the products involved. This does not include postal, parcel or freight services. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-7">See footnote 7</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Importer</strong> – A person established in NI who places a product from a country outside of the EEA or NI on the NI market. A person based in NI who distributes a product from GB onto the NI (or EEA) market, will from 1 January 2021 be an importer if they are bringing products into NI from the GB.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Manufacturer</strong> – A person who manufactures appliances or fittings or has them designed or manufactured and markets that product under their name or trademark.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Notified Body</strong> – A conformity assessment body based in the EEA which has been approved by an EEA Member State to carry out conformity assessment for placing products on the EU and NI markets; or a conformity assessment body that is based in the UK and has been approved by the Secretary of State, including bodies which were notified bodies whilst the UK followed EU rules. If these UK based Notified Bodies are used, the CE marking must be accompanied by the UKNI marking and cannot be placed on the EEA market (just the NI market, or, where it is also a qualifying NI good, the GB market)</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKCA Marking</strong> – The UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is the new UK conformity marking used for certain goods being placed on the GB market, in place of the CE marking, which is the conformity marking used in the European Union. All products placed on the GB market from 1 January 2023 must be UKCA marked. Products being placed on the NI market cannot be UKCA marked and must continue to be CE marked, but there are special arrangements in place to ensure NI’s unfettered access to the rest of the UK.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKNI marking</strong> (also known as the UK(NI) indication) – The UKNI marking must be used along with the CE marking if manufacturers wish to use a UK Notified Body for conformity assessment. The UKNI marking allows the product to be placed on the NI market (and, under the Government’s unfettered access commitments, where the product is also a qualifying NI good, on the GB market), but not the EEA market.</li>
</ul>
