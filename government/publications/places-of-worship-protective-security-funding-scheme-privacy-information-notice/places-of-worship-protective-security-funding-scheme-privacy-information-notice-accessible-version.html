<h2>How and why the department uses your information</h2>

<p>The Home Office collects, processes, and shares personal information to enable it to carry out its statutory and other functions.</p>

The processing of this information is necessary for the Home Office to undertake a public task as defined under Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) i.e. the processing is necessary for the Home Office to perform a task in the public interest or for its official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law. Here, applicant data is processed for the purpose of delivering the public task of protecting the public through the activities conducted as part of the Places of Worship (PoW) Protective Security Funding Scheme.</p>

<p>Should the Home Office suspect an individual or an organisation of improper use of grant funding, your personal data may be shared with the Charity Commission and law enforcement organisations. This personal data will be limited to the contact details of the applicant, the name and address of the place of worship or associated faith community centre, and the reasons why an improper use of grant funding is suspected.</p>

<p>The personal data provided will also be used by the Home Office to send communications to you that are related specifically to your grant application and (in the case of successful applicants) arrangements for the delivery of agreed security measures.</p>

<p>The Home Office may share your information with other organisations in the course of carrying out our functions, or to enable others to perform theirs. Your personal data will not be processed using automated decision-making technology or for the purposes of profiling. You are not under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide your data to the Home Office. However, if you do not share this information, we cannot process your application any further.</p>

<p>More information about the ways in which the Home Office may use your personal information, including the purposes for which we use it, the legal basis, and who your information may be shared with can be found in the Home Office <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a>.</p>

<h2>Disclosure notice</h2>

<p>In the course of this scheme where information is provided which relates to activity outside the improper use of funding, such as criminal acts, it is unlikely that identifiable information would be used to action any disclosure of threat, crime or harm. Should the Home Office or Esotec Limited suspect an individual or an organisation of using the scheme to warn of a threat to life, we will share this information with local police. Should an individual or organisation use the scheme to report a past crime, this will not be passed to the police.</p>

<p>Responses received into email inbox will not be routinely monitored, and information will not be shared in real time. Emergencies or threats to life should be reported to 999. All criminal activities should be passed to local police or dial 999 in an emergency. If participants are to contact the Home Office directly with a disclosure, our normal disclosure processes will be followed.</p>

<h2>Storing your information</h2>

<p>Your personal information will be held for seven years by the Home Office for the purpose for which it is being processed and in line with departmental retention policy. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/home-office-retention-and-disposal-standards">Find more details of this policy</a>.</p>
