<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Important update to Breeding Wader Guidance (August 2022)</h2>

<p>Find out about the updates we have made.</p>

<p>Government has committed to treble woodland creation rates in England by the end of this Parliament and set a legally binding target to halt species decline by 2030 through the Environment Act. There are some circumstances where our policy to deliver tree planting ambitions may exacerbate the decline of species of conservation concern if new woodlands are not appropriately sited.</p>

<p>Most waders that breed in England are regarded as threatened at GB and European scale. A particular priority is Curlew, that has its largest remaining global breeding populations in the UK. Strongholds for curlew and other waders tend to occur in upland areas of northern England where land values are low; areas which are also popular for woodland creation projects due to the marginal nature of farming in the uplands.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Zonal maps were introduced in November 2021, to guide wader conservation and forest expansion. Consultation with key stakeholders has informed how these maps can be used.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
At the start of this year Forestry Commission (FC) and Natural England (NE) developed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-afforestation-proposed-on-or-near-nationally-important-upland-breeding-wader-areas">‘Guidance for afforestation proposed on or near nationally important upland breeding wader areas’</a> to help landowners determine if a proposed site is likely to be important for waders. The process often includes commissioning of a breeding bird survey, which can be part-funded through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-planning-grant">Woodland Creation Planning Grant</a> (WCPG). Applicants are advised to have early engagement with NE for all proposals within or near protected sites notified for waders or national wader recovery areas e.g. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://curlewlife.org/" rel="external">Curlew LIFE</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
We have now refreshed the guidance (which is for application in upland northern England only) to incorporate three components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>risk based survey policy, a clear statement setting out where wader surveys are likely to be required, including whether FC will fund wader surveys or not</li>
  <li>guidance to help inform when an upland breeding wader survey is required.</li>
  <li>a decision flow diagram to help decide on the suitability of sites for woodland creation where we have breeding wader survey information&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>We will review this guidance again in 12 months (August 2023) drawing on experiences and commissioned analysis.</p>

<p>To find out more, watch our recent webinar&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgUY27xTq3o" rel="external">Woodland expansion and breeding waders: guidance update</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introducing a new Seed Sourcing Grant to boost tree seed production</h2>

<p>Check information about our upcoming&nbsp;Seed Sourcing Grant (SSG).</p>

<p>This Autumn, the Forestry Commission will be launching a new Seed Sourcing Grant (SSG) to support the sector in increasing the quantity, quality and diversity of Seed Stands and Seed Orchards in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seed Stands are defined groups of trees in the landscape from which seed is collected. Seed Orchards are planted using seed or clonal material from known parents and are generally situated outside of the natural landscape in an area convenient for seed collectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The funding is designed to boost domestic tree seed production. This will not only help meet increased demand for trees but also reduce the need to buy seed from the international market, lowering the risk of importing harmful pests and pathogens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grant also aims to improve the diversity of England’s seed supply, for example, by increasing the range of species and provenances available - crucial for creating diverse and resilient woodlands, which are better able to adapt to future climate conditions as well as new pests and diseases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grant forms part of the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nature-for-people-climate-and-wildlife/nature-for-people-climate-and-wildlife">Nature for Climate Fund</a>, which aims to create, restore and protect vital climate-regulating ecosystems including peatlands and woodlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To find out more, read the Forestry Commission’s latest blog <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/08/18/how-new-funding-will-help-to-support-englands-tree-seed-production/" rel="external">How new funding will help to support England’s tree seed production</a> or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SSG@forestrycommission.gov.uk">SSG@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>

Reminder: Seed Sourcing for Trees of the Future Webinar <br>
When: Tuesday 13&nbsp;September 2022, 9am&nbsp;– 4:45pm &nbsp;<br>
Registrations now open <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pheedloop.com/seedsourcing/site/home/" rel="external">Home | Seed Sourcing for Trees of the Future Webinar - September 13, 2022 (pheedloop.com)</a> &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
On Tuesday 13&nbsp;September, the Institute of Chartered Foresters will host a free one-day webinar, Seed Sourcing for Trees of the Future. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Supported by DEFRA and the Forestry Commission, the webinar will provide landowners, managers and foresters with guidance and advice on seed sourcing, a vital but often overlooked part of the tree production and planting process.  &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On the day, attendees will hear from technical experts as well as commercial seed suppliers and landowners. Topics covered will include how to effectively manage existing seed sources, identifying and registering new seed stands and the planting of seed orchards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The webinar is in partnership with the Royal Forestry Society (RFS), Country Land and Business Association (CLA), Confederation of Forest Industries (Confor) and Small Woods Association (SWA).</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Forestry Commission Key Performance Indicators: headline performance update at 30 June 2022</h2>

<p>See the Forestry Commission Key Performance Indicators.</p>

<p>The Forestry Commission publishes a range of key performance indicators (KPIs) to show our contribution towards forestry and woodlands in England and indicate trends in the wider forestry sector in England. The KPIs reflect our priorities to expand, protect, improve and connect England’s woodlands. We provide full reports for the full suite of 38 KPIs on an annual basis; the most recent being the Report for 2021-22. In addition, for the six headline KPIs we publish interim updates on a quarterly basis. You can now read the latest of these in the update to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/forestry-commission-key-performance-indicators-headline-performance-update-at-30-june-2022">30 June 2022 on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
