<p>The Cabinet Office Disability Unit is recruiting 9 Regional Stakeholder Network (<abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr>) chairs on behalf of the Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work. They will join an existing stakeholder engagement network that covers 9 regions of England.</p>

<p><abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Networks">RSNs</abbr> have supported government work throughout the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic, and have worked to develop and implement wider disability policy. The <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr>’s chairs work with networks in their region and the Cabinet Office to continue to ensure the voices of disabled people throughout England are heard and valued in a way that informs policy and strategy.</p>

<p>Previous chairs have made significant changes in their sectors, using their expertise to make good progress for disabled people. They have helped the government improve the lives of disabled people and remove many obstacles and barriers they can face.</p>

<p>Yet there is still more that can be done to improve the lives of disabled people. The new chairs will continue the work to tackle issues faced by many disabled people through an ongoing dialogue with the government.</p>

<h2>What being a chair involves</h2>

<p><abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr> chairs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leaders in their region who want to make a difference locally and nationally</li>
  <li>effective change-makers who help to drive improvements in the accessibility and quality of life for disabled people</li>
  <li>promoters of best practice from within the network</li>
  <li>coordinators of regular membership meetings</li>
  <li>advocates for the voices of disabled people, heard through a range of platforms</li>
</ul>

<p>These are voluntary positions held for a maximum of one year, alongside the chair’s usual job.</p>

<h2>Could you be a chair?</h2>

<p>As a chair, it is expected that you will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a self-motivated, successful leader in your region, with strong networks</li>
  <li>credible and respected within your region, and able to reach out to a wide range of disabled people, their carers, parents and disabled people’s organisations</li>
  <li>passionate about driving social change for disabled people</li>
</ul>

<p>The 9 chairs should live and work in one of the following regions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>South East</li>
  <li>South West</li>
  <li>East of England</li>
  <li>London</li>
  <li>West Midlands</li>
  <li>East Midlands</li>
  <li>Yorkshire and the Humber</li>
  <li>North West</li>
  <li>North East</li>
</ul>

<h2>What a former <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr> chair had to say about the role</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr> has been a great opportunity so far, to talk to disabled people and their representative organisations across the North West. As a proactive network we have been able to address barriers disabled people face by gathering insight to influence policy such as the impact of the pandemic, the importance of advocacy, and communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lynne Turnbull - Chair <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr> North West.</p>
