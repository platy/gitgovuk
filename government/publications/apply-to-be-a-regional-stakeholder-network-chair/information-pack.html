<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>The Government is committed to improving the everyday lives of all disabled people.</p>

<p>And our Regional Stakeholder Network, made up of 9 regional groups from across England, is crucial in making sure disabled peopleâs lived experiences are understood and championed.</p>

<p>As we deliver change for disabled people, it is crucial that we keep that lived experience at the heart of policy making, every step of the way.</p>

<p>Therefore, we are refreshing the Regional Stakeholder Network.</p>

<p>We are looking for regional chairs who will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help shape national policy</li>
  <li>be a bridge between disabled people, their organisations and Government.</li>
</ul>

<p>They will work in a voluntary capacity, alongside senior civil servants and me, to help make a difference for disabled people.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take a look at the recruitment process and consider if this leadership role, within your region, would be a good fit for you.</p>

<p>My team in the Disability Unit will be on hand to answer any questions you may have, and if you do decide this opportunity is for you then I wish you the best of luck in the process.</p>

<p>Chloe Smith <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr><br><br>
Minister for Disabled People</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background to the Disability Unit</h2>

<p>We support the Minister for Disabled People, Work and Health in their cross-government role on disability.</p>

<p>At the heart of our work is a focus on reducing the barriers faced by disabled people, both in government and across wider business and society.</p>

<p>We are the focal point for the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities across government.</p>

<p>We lead on the Inter-Ministerial Group (<abbr title="Inter-Ministerial Group">IMG</abbr>) â Disability and Society.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>About the Regional Stakeholder Network</h2>

<p>The Regional Stakeholder Network began in 2019. It is facilitated by the Disability Unit to enhance the governmentâs existing engagement with disabled people.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Objectives</h3>

<p>The main objectives of our stakeholder engagement are to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular, meaningful opportunities for disabled people to share their views and experiences of the policies, services and programmes that affect them â and inform government on issues that they feel are important</li>
  <li>greater diversity and regional representation from individuals and smaller disability organisations</li>
  <li>a more proactive approach to engagement with face-to-face meetings, virtual meetings, digital communication and other accessible methods</li>
  <li>the co-ordination of disabled peopleâs views to feed them into the design, development and running of government policies, services and programmes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to meet these objectives we have established a Regional Stakeholder Network (<abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr>), made up of 9 regional groups.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>How it works</h3>

<p>There are 9 regional groups in England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>North West</li>
  <li>North East</li>
  <li>Yorkshire and the Humber</li>
  <li>West Midlands</li>
  <li>East Midlands</li>
  <li>South West</li>
  <li>South East</li>
  <li>East of England</li>
  <li>Greater London</li>
</ul>

<p>Each regional network consists of 10 to 40 members from local disabled people, parents and carers of disabled people and disabled peopleâs representative organisations.</p>

<p>The regional network is led by a chair who is supported by a deputy. The chair and deputy are supported by the Disability Unit and will be provided with a small expense budget for personal assistance in the role.</p>

<p>Each of the regional networks should meet at least 4 times once a year. These meetings will be arranged and paid for by the Disability Unit. Networks will have the freedom to meet more often should they wish, but this would be without Disability Unit support. The meetings provide an open forum to share views and experience across all policies and services that affect disabled people. The meetings will also have more structured discussions about a âthemeâ about which government would like to hear peopleâs views and experiences.</p>

<p>The network chairs will meet monthly. This is currently a virtual meeting. The agenda for the meetings will be decided collaboratively between the chairs and the Disability Unit, and will be based on the principles as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>ensure fairness and equality</strong> â we will empower disabled people by promoting fairness and equality of opportunities, outcomes and experiences, including work and access to products and services</li>
  <li>
<strong>consider disability from the start</strong> â we will embed inclusive and accessible approaches and services to avoid creating disabling experiences from the outset</li>
  <li>
<strong>support independent living</strong> â we will actively encourage initiatives that support all disabled people to have choice and control in life</li>
  <li>
<strong>increase participation</strong> â we will enable greater inclusion of a diverse disabled population in the development and delivery of services, products and policies</li>
  <li>
<strong>deliver joined-up responses</strong> â we will work across organisational boundaries and improve data and evidence to better understand and respond to complex issues that affect disabled people</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the meetings, the Disability Unit will engage with the networks and other disabled peopleâs organisations through email, and digital services such as Citizen Space to enable even more disabled people to share their views online. We will also be providing opportunities for disabled people who donât have access to or cannot use digital means to engage by other methods.</p>

<p>The Chairs will play an important role in providing insight through our contract to gather qualitative and quantitative data. Insight gathered from the meetings and engagement will be passed to the relevant government department and policy makers working on the issues that have been identified, and to the Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work through a Ministerial Advisory Group.</p>

<p>The Disability Unit will provide a âyou said, we didâ format of reporting back to the regions via the Chairs group. Feedback will also help to inform disability policy and the governmentâs responsibilities under the <abbr title="UN Convention on the Rights Disabled People">UNCRPD</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Themed quarters and digital engagement</h2>

<p>To structure the evidence and insight collected from stakeholders there will be a different theme every 3 months. The theme will reflect one or more of the policy or service delivery discussions identified by either the Inter-Ministerial Group, stakeholder feedback, or government departments wanting to engage with disabled people when considering new policies or significant policy changes.</p>

<p>The Disability Unit will work with the government department leading on the policy area to identify a series of questions for stakeholders that are designed to provide valuable insight and evidence for policy makers to enhance policy development or service design. We will be very clear from the outset that this is not a formal consultation and as such we will not be producing a formal response or responding directly to feedback received.</p>

<p>During each âthemed quarterâ the Disability Unit will help set-up and facilitate up to 3 regional events to enable face to face discussion about that quarterâs theme. Officials from the relevant policy areas will attend these events along with the Disability Unit. It will be the responsibility of the regional chairs to provide summaries of the discussion and feedback for discussion at the Ministerial Advisory Group.</p>

<p>Regional networks where a face to face meeting is not taking place, and stakeholders or individuals who are not members of a network, will be able to participate through a digital communication channel and other accessible means.</p>

<p>The digital communication channel will be an online survey style system â for example, Citizen Space. It will be used to enable stakeholders to contribute their views on the âthemesâ and will be enhanced by video blogs, regular messaging and twitter promotion from the Disability Unit to share important messages such as how the government is using this information. The Disability Unit will use the softwareâs analysis tools and share the analysis with policy officials to use in policy development or service design.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>How the government will use this information</h3>

<p>The Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work will meet with the Chairs of the 9 regional groups to hear about the views and priorities of the members of each group.</p>

<p>Additionally, the views and experiences gathered from the Regional Stakeholder Network meetings and from the online engagement will be passed to the relevant government department and policy makers working on the issues that have been identified. This information will be used to help them to understand where policies might not be working as well as they could be, or provide feedback on things that are working well.</p>

<p>The Disability Unit will provide updates to the members of the Regional Stakeholder Network to share progress on the issues that have been raised and how government is using this this information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Regional Stakeholder Network chair role</h2>

<p>We are looking for Chairs with lived experience and understanding of disability who represents groups of disabled people in each region. They will have links, and can make links, with other local organisations in their region to identify issues of interest to disabled people and represent those disabled people at the regional Network.</p>

<p>The Chairs will be expected to engage with and give feedback to other local organisations between Network meetings to ensure that their representation is accurate and current to the needs of the people they represent.</p>

<p>The Chairs must be fair and even handed, and must be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>convene and facilitate Network meetings and ensure all members have the opportunity to be fully engaged with the meeting process</li>
  <li>be impartial and ensure all voices are heard regardless of their personal views and report a broad range of views</li>
  <li>work with the Disability Unit to feed the views of the Network to the government and coordinate the work of their Network during the year</li>
  <li>represent the Network at a quarterly Ministerial Advisory Group</li>
</ul>

<p>They will be expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confidently engage with different people, gain their views and opinions</li>
  <li>be a figurehead for the Network in their region, ensuring that regular recruitment of organisations and members are encouraged to join.</li>
  <li>report views and opinions of others in an engaging and meaningful way, reflecting differences of opinion and points of agreement</li>
  <li>bring together people with differing views</li>
  <li>build trust to create a collaboration and dialogue between network members</li>
</ul>

<p>The appointments are unpaid, however travel expenses and any costs required to support a disability will be paid to enable you to attend the annual Network meeting and the Ministerial Advisory Group. The meetings are all currently held virtually. There is an expense allowance for Chairs to gain personal assistance with the administration of the Network.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>All discussions will be conducted under â<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule" rel="external">Chatham House rules</a>â. Participants are free to use the information received, but the identity of the speaker is not revealed.  Comments will be attributed to the network as a whole not to an individual.</p>

<p>All information will be treated in the strictest confidence. However, if you are successful, some information will be used to prepare the press notice of successful appointees â we will however clear any information used with you first.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Standards of conduct and conflicts of interest</h2>

<p>The successful candidate will be required to show commitment to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2">Seven Principles of Public Life</a>, as drawn up by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, more commonly known as the Nolan Principles.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr> is a public body and, as such, is  expected to maintain a register of membersâ interests to avoid any danger of board members being influenced or appearing to be influenced, by their private interests in the exercise of their public duties. Candidates may be questioned about any real or perceived conflicts of interest. These do not constitute an automatic bar to appointment, but they must be manageable.</p>

<p>Conflicts could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial arrangements â for example, fees or shareholdings of the candidate, business associates or close family</li>
  <li>membership of organisations whose aims might be perceived to be in conflict with those of the Cabinet Office the DWP</li>
  <li>any activity which, if revealed after appointment, could cause embarrassment to the government</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Equal opportunities</h2>

<p>The Department is committed to providing real equality of opportunity irrespective of race, nationality, colour, ethnic or national origin, disability, religion, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, age, gender assignment, work pattern or membership or non-membership of a Trade Union.</p>

<p>We take our obligations under the Data Protection Act seriously. Any information about you will be held in secure conditions with access restricted to those who need it in connection with dealing with your application and the selection process.</p>

<span class="number">14. </span>Annex: Role description</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>&nbsp;Background</h3>

<p>In 2019, the Cabinet Officeâs Disability Unit (previously the Office for Disability Issues) established Regional Stakeholder Networks (<abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Networks">RSNs</abbr>) of disabled people and disabled peopleâs user-led organisations to advise government officials on inclusive policy development.</p>

<p>The networks support the governmentâs commitment to meet the requirements of the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Convention on the Rights Disabled People (<abbr title="UN Convention on the Rights Disabled People">UNCRPD</abbr>) to bring disability issues into the mainstream across policy-making.</p>

<p>There are 9 <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Networks">RSNs</abbr> in England, one in each English region. Each network has a local chair who acts as the central link between its members and the Disability Unit. Each network has 10 to 40 members representing the diversity of disabled people in the region.</p>

<p>The work of the <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Networks">RSNs</abbr> will be organised in themes, which change every 3 months. The networks will have one meeting arranged by the Disability Unit each year, but may meet more often if they wish. The networks will engage by digital or other means during the rest of the year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>&nbsp;What we are looking for</h3>

<p>We are looking for people keen to be <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr> chairs with an understanding of disability who represent groups of disabled people in each region. They will have links, and can make links, with other local organisations in their region to identify issues of interest to disabled people and represent those disabled people at the <abbr title="Regional Stakeholder Network">RSN</abbr>.</p>

<p>The chairs will be expected to engage with and give feedback to other local organisations between network meetings to ensure that their representation is accurate and current to the needs of the people they represent.</p>

<p>Each network chair must be fair and equal. They will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>convene and facilitate network meetings and ensure all members have the opportunity to be fully engaged with the meeting process</li>
  <li>be impartial and ensure all voices are heard regardless of their personal views and report a broad range of views</li>
  <li>work with the Disability Unit to feed the views of the network to the government and coordinate the work of their network during the year</li>
  <li>represent the network at a Ministerial Advisory Group every 3 months</li>
</ul>

<p>They will be expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confidently engage with different people, gain their views and opinions</li>
  <li>report views and opinions of others in an engaging and meaningful way, reflecting differences of opinion and points of agreement</li>
  <li>bring together people with differing views</li>
  <li>build trust to create a collaboration and dialogue between network members</li>
</ul>

<p>Chairs will not be paid, but travel expenses with receipts will be paid to attend the annual network meeting and the Ministerial Advisory Group.</p>

<p>The chairs can access 4 hours of personal administration support per week, paid at a rate of Â£25 per hour.</p>

<p>These expenses are for the sole use of supporting the Chair and the administrative duties associated with the role. Expenses must be claimed using official Disability Unit forms.</p>
