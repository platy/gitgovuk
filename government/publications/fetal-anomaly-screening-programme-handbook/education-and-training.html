<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Ultrasound training requirements for the combined test</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Providers are responsible for assessing the competence of each practitioner before they scan independently.</p>

<p>Competence to undertake ultrasound scans for the combined test must be assessed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reviewing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service-report-types/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service-report-types#detailed-ultrasound-report-for-each-individual-ultrasound-practitioner">the ultrasound practitioner’s DQASS NT feedback plot</a>
</li>
  <li>reviewing ultrasound images</li>
</ul>

<p>Both components are essential.</p>
</div>

<p>Trainee ultrasound practitioners must complete 2 training parts, as described below, to gain competence in ultrasound scans for the combined test.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Training part 1: e-learning resources</h3>

<p>There are 3 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/" rel="external">e-learning resources</a> on screening for <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#Downs">trisomy 21 (<abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#Edwards">trisomy 18 (<abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr>)</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#Pataus">trisomy 13 (<abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>)</a>. These resources should be completed prior to starting practical training.</p>

<p>The resources are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Screening for Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome’</li>
  <li>‘Non-invasive prenatal testing – evaluative roll out’</li>
  <li>‘First trimester screening resource for ultrasound practitioners’</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Training part 2: practical training process</h3>

<p>Practical training is overseen by the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>When practical training starts the trainee will not initially require a unique <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service#dqass-identity-codes"><abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code</a> as the trainee will not be the responsible practitioner. This is because the trainee will be observing and gaining hands-on experience before becoming more proficient at measuring the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>.</p>

<p>Once the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> is satisfied the trainee can achieve <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements with minimal guidance from a qualified member of staff, a <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code is required.</p>

<p>The trainee should use their <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code on the screening request form when their measurements are used. It is not necessary for the supervising practitioner to use their <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code, unless they have remeasured the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and/or <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>.</p>

<p>The training process should take no longer than 6 months. The training code ‘T’ will remain valid during this time. If training is not completed within 6 months then the reasons should be recorded by the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> contacted if an extension is required.</p>

<p>The trainee’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service-report-types">individual <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> feedback plot</a> is sent to the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> with the usual 6-monthly <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> report.</p>

<p>This is the step-by-step process that should be followed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Practical training starts.</li>
  <li>Trainee able to achieve <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements with minimal guidance from the supervising practitioner.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> informs <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> of the new trainee’s details to obtain a <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> issues unique <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code matched to an ultrasound department with the suffix “T” to indicate a practitioner in training. For example, 123456T.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> informs screening laboratory of trainee’s details.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and trainee jointly review images using the image review tool (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/983620/Image_review_tool_and_template_for_logging_3-monthly_image_review.ods" rel="external">download the image review tool spreadsheet</a>).</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> reviews images of <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/screening-for-downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome--3#measurements">nuchal translucency (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>) and crown rump length (<abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>) measurements</a> taken independently by the trainee under supervision.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> reviews these images against the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/screening-for-downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome--3#NT-criteria">NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> criteria</a> using the image review tool. If the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> has no concerns, proceed to the next step. If the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> has concerns, additional support and training should be given before reassessing new images.</li>
  <li>Trainee collects at least 25 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> reviews these measurements using the diagnostic plot self-assessment tool (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840984/Nuchal_translucency_diagnostic_plot_spreadsheet.xlsx" rel="external">download the diagnostic self-assessment tool spreadsheet</a>). When this tool shows the estimated bias is less than 0.30mm and spread is consistent with Fetal Medicine Foundation (<abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr>) reference curve, <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> sends the 25 paired measurements to <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr>.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> confirms new measurements are within NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> criteria for bias and spread.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> provides feedback to the trainee, including:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation that bias is less than 0.30mm</li>
  <li>confirmation spread is consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve</li>
  <li>outcome of image review</li>
  <li>confirmation trainee is competent to start screening under supervision</li>
</ul>

<p>13. <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> records the support provided, all actions and the outcome. They may use the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook">template for trainee ultrasound practitioners performing combined screening</a>.<br>
14. Trainees must continue to use the training code “T” and have supervised practice until they have gained their obstetric ultrasound qualification.</p>

<p>Trainees should use their own <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code on the biochemistry form if their measurements are used.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the supervising practitioner to use their <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code, unless they have remeasured the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and/or <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>.</p>

<p>The training process should take no longer than 6 months. The training code “T” will remain valid during this time. If training is not completed within 6 months, then the reasons should be recorded by the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> contacted if an extension is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Guidance to be followed before qualified ultrasound practitioners participate in combined screening</h3>

<p>This applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new staff including those who may have worked elsewhere but are new to the department</li>
  <li>agency and bank staff who are new to the department</li>
  <li>practitioners who have had a break in service and are returning to work</li>
  <li>new staff from overseas who will first need a unique <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> should inform <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> and the screening laboratory of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of new or agency staff member</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code</li>
  <li>previous place of work</li>
</ul>

<p>The level of support required will vary depending on the practitioner’s previous experience in screening and how long they were not at work.</p>

<p>Any required support is discussed and agreed on an individual basis between the ultrasound practitioner and <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr>. The following should be discussed as part of the induction process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> e-learning ‘first trimester screening resource for ultrasound practitioners’ completed in the last 12 months</li>
  <li>practical scan sessions during the induction period</li>
  <li>review of images using the image review tool</li>
  <li>ultrasound equipment and scan environment</li>
  <li>the ultrasound practitioner’s most recent <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> feedback plot issued by <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> within the last 6 months (this will provide current feedback on bias, spread and throughput, and it is the responsibility of the ultrasound practitioner to provide this report)</li>
</ul>

<p>To make sure ultrasound practitioners meet the requirements for combined screening the following step-by-step guide should be followed alongside the local induction process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and practitioner discuss and agree the practical and theoretical support required.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and practitioner must review the practitioner’s most recent <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> feedback plot. If issued within the last 6 months and no concerns identified, steps 8 to 10 are not required. If issued within the last 6 months and concerns are identified, all steps and any outstanding action plans must be completed. If issued more than 6 months ago, all steps must be completed (this also applies if no <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> report is available).</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> informs <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> of practitioner’s name, <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code and previous place of work.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> informs screening laboratory of practitioner’s name and <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> identity code.</li>
  <li>Practitioner starts supported practical scan sessions.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and practitioner review images of <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements taken by the practitioner.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> reviews these images using the image review tool. If the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> has no concerns, proceed to the next step. If the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> has concerns, additional support and training should be given before reassessing new images.</li>
  <li>Practitioner collects 25 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> reviews the distribution of these 25 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840984/Nuchal_translucency_diagnostic_plot_spreadsheet.xlsx" rel="external">diagnostic plot self-assessment tool</a>. When this tool shows the bias is less than 0.30mm and spread is consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve, <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> sends the 25 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements to <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr>.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> confirms new measurements are within the NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> criteria for bias and spread.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> provides feedback to the practitioner, including:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation estimated bias is less than 0.30mm</li>
  <li>confirmation spread is consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve</li>
  <li>outcome of image review</li>
  <li>confirmation the practitioner can start combined screening independently</li>
</ul>
