<h2>Template A. Lower chance result letter – Down’s syndrome screening only</h2>

<p>Dear (name),</p>

<p>Re: Your first trimester screening result</p>

<p>You recently had the ‘combined test’ to screen for Down’s syndrome. This has shown that your baby has a lower chance of having this condition.</p>

<p>For this pregnancy, you have 1 chance in (number) of having a baby with Down’s syndrome.</p>

<p>To understand what ‘1 chance in (number)’ means, imagine a group of (number) women. One of these women will be pregnant with a baby that has the condition.</p>

<p>We do not offer further testing at this level of chance. A lower chance result does not mean that there is no chance at all that the baby has Down’s syndrome, just that it is unlikely.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about your result, you can contact me using the details below.</p>

<p>You can find more information about antenatal screening for this condition, including details of parent support organisations, at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/depscreening" rel="external">www.nhs.uk/depscreening</a>.</p>

<h2>Template B. Lower chance result letter – screening for all 3 conditions</h2>

<p>Dear (name),</p>

<p>Re: Your first trimester screening results</p>

<p>You recently had the ‘combined test’ to screen for Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome. This has shown that your baby has a lower chance of having these conditions. Your individual chances for this pregnancy are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Down’s syndrome 1 chance in (number 1)</li>
  <li>Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome 1 chance in (number 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>To understand what 1 chance in (number 1) means, imagine a group of (number 1) women. One of these women will be pregnant with a baby that has Down’s syndrome.</p>

<p>To understand what 1 chance in (number 2) means, imagine a group of (number 2) women. One of these women will be pregnant with a baby with Edwards’ syndrome or Patau’s syndrome.</p>

<p>We do not offer further testing at this level of chance. A lower chance result does not mean that there is no chance at all that the baby has Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome or Patau’s syndrome, just that it is unlikely.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about your results, you can contact me using the details below.</p>
