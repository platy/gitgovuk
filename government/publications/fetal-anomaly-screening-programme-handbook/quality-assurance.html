<hr>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> has a defined set of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-standards">screening standards</a> providers must meet to make sure local services are safe and effective.</p>

<p>The aim of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-population-screening-quality-assurance">quality assurance</a> (<abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr>) is to maintain these standards and drive continuous improvement in the screening programme. It covers the entire screening pathway, from identifying who is eligible to be invited for screening, through to receipt of referral where required. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/screening-quality-assurance-service-operating-model">screening quality assurance service (<abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr>)</a> performs <abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr> for the NHS screening programmes.</p>

<p><abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr> is essential to minimise harm and maximise the benefits of screening.</p>

<p>Antenatal and newborn (<abbr title="Antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr>) <abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr> makes sure all women and their babies have access to high quality screening wherever they live. <abbr title="Antenatal and newborn">ANNB</abbr> <abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr> has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/antenatal-and-newborn-screening-quality-assurance-procedures">quality assurance procedures</a> for checking standards are met.</p>

<p>To make sure services are set up correctly and meet standards, all commissioners and service providers must refer to the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome-screening-pathway-requirements-specification">Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome screening pathway requirements specification</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/20-week-screening-scan-pathway-requirements-specification">20-week screening scan pathway requirements specification</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In line with the pathway requirements specifications, providers should have the following posts in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a screening midwife or coordinator and deputy to oversee the screening programme and act as a link between other members of the local and regional screening teams</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#SSS">screening support sonographer (<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr>)</a> and deputy with administrative support to specifically support the ultrasound part of the combined and quadruple test</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers should make sure there is continual cover for all posts.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Quality assurance of ultrasound: the role of the screening support sonographer</h2>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> recommends the provider has a dedicated <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr>, with a deputy to provide continual cover. These roles are to oversee the implementation, delivery and monitoring of the ultrasound part of the combined and quadruple screening pathways.</p>

<p>Details of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service#the-screening-support-sonographer">functions of the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr></a> are available on the <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Nuchal translucency and crown rump length diagnostic plot self-assessment tool</h3>
<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1070575/Nuchal_translucency_and_crown_rump_length_diagnostic_plot_self-assessment_tool.xlsx" rel="external">diagnostic plot self-assessment tool</a> is provided to assist monitoring of <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements, we recommend using weekly or monthly depending on the number of scans performed. The tool is not designed to be used at the time of the scan to compare measurements to the Fetal Medicine Foundation (<abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr>) reference curve.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Departmental review of ultrasound images</h2>

<p>Reviewing ultrasound images and providing feedback to ultrasound practitioners can help to improve the quality of images. This is not designed to be used as a performance management tool.</p>

<p>The review of ultrasound images aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assist and support ultrasound practitioners in making continuous improvements in their <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/screening-for-downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome--3#measurements">nuchal translucency (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>) and crown rump length (<abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>)</a> measurement techniques</li>
  <li>provide regular feedback to ultrasound practitioners</li>
  <li>encourage shared learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Reviewing ultrasound images is an essential part of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/education-and-training#practical-training">practical training</a> process for trainees</li>
  <li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service-report-types/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service-report-types#detailed-ultrasound-report-for-each-individual-ultrasound-practitioner">management of red flags</a></li>
  <li>3 monthly departmental image review</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> should make sure there is a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documented process for departmental review of ultrasound images</li>
  <li>log of image review dates and any agreed actions; <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> requires evidence this is performed</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>3 monthly departmental image review</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Regular departmental review of ultrasound images is equally as important as reviewing the ultrasound practitioner’s DQASS NT feedback plot.</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> should undertake a 3 monthly image review of paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> images taken by all ultrasound practitioners, including agency staff.</p>

<p>To perform the 3 monthly image review the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reviews 3 randomly selected paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> images for each ultrasound practitioner.</li>
  <li>Assesses each image using the image review tool.</li>
  <li>Provides timely feedback to the ultrasound practitioner.</li>
  <li>Keeps a record that these reviews are undertaken.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Providing feedback</h4>

<p>There are 12 criteria for both <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/screening-for-downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome--3#NT-criteria"><abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/screening-for-downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome--3#CRL-criteria"><abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr></a> images.</p>

<p>The image criteria assume the baby is supine but can be applied when the baby is prone, although it may not be possible to assess criteria 3 (echogenic tip of nose).</p>

<p>Further information on the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> criteria is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/" rel="external">First trimester resource for ultrasound practitioners e-learning module</a>.</p>

<p>The image review tool supports the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess the paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> images against the NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> criteria</li>
  <li>provide feedback on images</li>
  <li>identify any need for further support</li>
</ul>

<p>As a minimum the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> should use this tool to provide feedback on any criteria that are not met.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> will identify one of the following outcomes after performing the image review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no further support required</li>
  <li>further support required</li>
</ul>

<p>If no further support is required, it means the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> has no concerns following the image review. The ultrasound practitioner receives feedback on any minor improvements that could be made.</p>

<p>If further support is required, it means the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> has concerns with the image review. It is recommended that a further 3 paired images are reviewed, and feedback provided.</p>

<p>If concerns continue after reviewing a further 3 paired images, the ultrasound practitioner should be offered further timely support. This support should be recorded and may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>observation of scan technique</li>
  <li>one to one image review</li>
  <li>review of completed e-learning resources</li>
</ul>

<p>If concerns continue after providing further support, the <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> should escalate these concerns according to local policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Shared learning</h3>

<p>Suggestions of local activities to encourage shared learning include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>group review of a selection of images</li>
  <li>anonymised previously reviewed images shared within the department</li>
  <li>each practitioner measures selected <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> images previously stored on an ultrasound machine; results are then compared and shared</li>
  <li>buddy scanning to improve image optimisation</li>
  <li>sharing key learning points from all image reviews with the department</li>
</ul>

<p>These are suggestions and will not be externally audited.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Image review resources</h3>

<p>Image review resources include the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook">image review tool and a template for logging the 3 monthly image review</a>.
It also includes example sheets of how these could be completed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Examples of image review and feedback</h3>

<p>Example 1 shows 2 ultrasound images of a <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> and an <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> that meet all the criteria. There is also a screenshot of what the accompanying image review tool would look like for both images.</p>

<p>Example 2 shows 2 ultrasound images of a <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> and an <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> that do not meet all the criteria. There is also a screenshot of what the accompanying image review tool would look like for both images.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Screening safety incidents</h2>

<p>A screening safety incident is any unintended or unexpected incident(s) that could have or did lead to harm to one or more persons who are eligible for NHS screening. This also applies to staff working in the screening programmes.</p>

<p>A screening safety incident can affect populations as well as individuals. It is an actual or possible failure in the screening pathway.</p>

<p>Providers will comply with the national guidance for the management of safety concerns and incidents in screening programmes and NHS England’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-safety-incidents-in-nhs-screening-programmes">guidance for managing safety incidents in NHS screening programmes</a>.</p>

<p>Laboratory and ultrasound services are expected to inform the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>)</a> of any adverse incidents.</p>
