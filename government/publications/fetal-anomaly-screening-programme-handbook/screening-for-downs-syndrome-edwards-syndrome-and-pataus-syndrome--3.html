<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>The combined test</h2>

<p>The combined test assesses the chance of the baby having <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#Downs">trisomy 21 (<abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#Edwards">trisomy 18 (<abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr>)</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#Pataus">trisomy 13 (<abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>)</a> by using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#maternal">maternal age</a></li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#markers">biochemical markers</a> – free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (<abbr title="beta human chorionic gonadotropin">bhCG</abbr>) and pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (<abbr title="pregnancy associated plasma protein-A">PAPP-A</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#measurements">ultrasound measurements</a> – nuchal translucency (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>) and crown rump length (<abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement must be used in combination with a maternal blood sample for calculating the chance result. It must not be used alone.</p>

<p>Assessment techniques and biometric charts used for ultrasound measurements must meet nationally agreed standards, as outlined in the British Medical Ultrasound Society (<abbr title="British Medical Ultrasound Society">BMUS</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmus.org/policies-statements-guidelines/professional-guidance/fetal-measurements/" rel="external">Fetal size and dating: charts recommended for clinical obstetric practice (2009)</a> guidelines.</p>

<p>The eligibility criteria for the combined test is when the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is between 45.0mm and 84.0mm.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is &lt; 45.0mm, the woman is recalled for a further ultrasound scan to measure the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and remeasure the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is &gt; 84.0mm, the gestational age is calculated using the head circumference (<abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr>). The <a class="govuk-link" href="#quadruple-test">quadruple test</a> is offered if the criteria is met.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to measure the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>, at least one more attempt is offered (‘twice on the couch’). This may be on the same day or at a later date according to local guidelines. The <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> and <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement must be taken on the same day.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to measure the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> despite ‘twice on the couch’, further attempts do not need to be offered. The woman is offered the quadruple test.</p>

<p>The combined test gives the woman more time to consider screening options. In practice, there are 2 ways the combined test can be performed and this determines how the woman receives the chance result. The maternal blood sample can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taken at the time of the ultrasound scan</li>
  <li>taken before the ultrasound scan (from 10 weeks onwards)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the sample is taken at the time of the ultrasound scan and sent to the screening laboratory, the chance result report from the combined test is usually available within a few days of the result being authorised by the laboratory.</p>

<p>If the sample is taken immediately before the ultrasound scan (from 10 weeks onwards), the screening laboratory makes the biochemistry results available to the ultrasound department; the chance result is calculated in the ultrasound/maternity department.</p>

<p>The laboratory is responsible for the chance calculation software and the chance result.</p>

<p>Ultrasound/maternity departments must have a process in place to share ultrasound measurements and final screening results with the laboratory. It is recommended that the laboratory take responsibility for auditing all chance results.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Chance results can only be recalculated in exceptional circumstances. For example, incorrect data on the screening request form that affects the chance calculation.</p>
</div>

<p>Every woman who accepts a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-pregnancy-scan-brief-description">pregnancy dating scan</a> needs to be informed that unexpected findings may be identified. This must include any woman who declines screening for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> and/or <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>.</p>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> does not provide guidance regarding the clinical care of a woman who has declined the combined test and has an unexpected finding on the ultrasound scan. This may include an <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> of ≥ 3.5mm. Local guidance for the care and management of these women should be in place.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome-screening-pathway-requirements-specification">Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome screening pathway requirements specification</a> outlines failsafe systems providers must have in place. For example, follow-up of attendance at appointments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>The quadruple test</h2>

<p>The quadruple test screens for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> only.</p>

<p>The quadruple test is offered when the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement cannot be obtained</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement is &gt; 84.0mm and the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> measurement is between 101.0mm and 172.0mm</li>
</ul>

<p>The quadruple test uses maternal age and the following 4 biochemical markers measured from 14<sup>+2</sup> to 20<sup>+0</sup> weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alpha-fetoprotein (<abbr title="alpha-fetoprotein">AFP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>human chorionic gonadotropin (<abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr>) or free <abbr title="beta human chorionic gonadotropin">bhCG</abbr>
</li>
  <li>inhibin-A</li>
  <li>unconjugated oestriol (<abbr title="unconjugated oestriol">uE3</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This combination of markers has a lower <abbr title="DR">detection rate</abbr> (<abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr>) and a higher <abbr title="SPR">screen positive rate</abbr> (<abbr title="screen positive rate">SPR</abbr>) than the combined test. For a woman presenting in the second trimester, an ultrasound scan is required to measure the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> to date the pregnancy and complete the quadruple test.</p>

<p>The quadruple test is performed when the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> is between 101.0mm and 172.0mm.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> is more than 172.0mm, the quadruple test must not be offered. The woman is offered the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/20-week-screening-scan">20-week screening scan</a>.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> is &lt; 101.0mm and the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is &gt; 84.0mm, there are 2 options.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Option 1</h3>

<p>Use the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> measurement to calculate the dates that the woman will be between 14<sup>+2</sup> and 20<sup>+0</sup> weeks. Offer an appointment during this time for a blood sample to be taken for the quadruple test.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Option 2</h3>

<p>Use the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> measurement to calculate the date that the woman will be over 14<sup>+2</sup> weeks. Rebook the woman for a further ultrasound scan where the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> can be remeasured and a blood sample taken for the quadruple test.</p>

For example, follow-up of attendance at appointments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>More information</h3>

<p>More information is available regarding practical solutions to combining dating and screening requirements at the ultrasound scan for the combined or quadruple test in the <abbr title="British Medical Ultrasound Society">BMUS</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmus.org/policies-statements-guidelines/professional-guidance/fetal-measurements/" rel="external">‘A practical solution to combining dating and screening for Down’s syndrome’ (2011)</a> guidelines.</p>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> does not provide guidance regarding the clinical care of a woman who has declined the quadruple test and has an unexpected finding on the pregnancy dating scan. Local guidance for the care and management of these women should be in place.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Non-invasive prenatal testing (<abbr title="non-invasive pre-natal testing">NIPT</abbr>)</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/screening-for-downs-syndrome-edwards-syndrome-and-pataus-syndrome-non-invasive-prenatal-testing-nipt"><abbr title="non-invasive pre-natal testing">NIPT</abbr> screening for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr></a> is offered following a higher chance result (between 1 in 2 and 1 in 150) from either the combined or the quadruple test in both singleton and twin pregnancies.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/uk-national-screening-committee-uk-nsc">UK National Screening Committee</a> (<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>) has recommended introducing <abbr title="non-invasive pre-natal testing">NIPT</abbr> as an evaluative rollout. This is so any necessary changes to the screening pathway can be made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Markers used in the combined and quadruple tests</h2>

<p>There are a number of markers that are used to calculate the chance result.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Maternal age</h3>

<p>All pregnant women have a chance of having a baby with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> or <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>. This chance increases with age. The older the woman, the greater the chance the baby will have one of these conditions.</p>

<p>The graph below shows the chance of a woman having a baby with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> or <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> (y axis) according to maternal age (x axis).</p>

<p>The graph shows that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the same maternal age the chance of <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> is higher than that of <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr>, and the chance of <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> is higher than that of <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the chance of a woman having a baby with one of the conditions increases as maternal age increases</li>
  <li>the chance does not increase much between 15 to 30 years of age, but after 30 years of age the chance increases more rapidly with age</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Biochemical markers</h3>

<p>Screening laboratories must use the recommended combination of biochemical markers for both the combined and quadruple tests.</p>

<p>Biochemical markers are analytes in the maternal blood that are measured by the laboratory and used to calculate the chance of a woman having a baby with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> or <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>. The levels of these markers are affected by certain factors such as gestational age, ethnicity, smoking, maternal weight and maternal diabetes. To adjust these effects the levels are standardised and expressed as multiples of median (<abbr title="multiples of median">MoM</abbr>) values. It is important that information about these factors is clearly written on the screening request form so the laboratories can make the correct adjustments.</p>

<p>The following analytes are measured by the laboratory to calculate the chance result.</p>

<h4>Alpha fetoprotein (<abbr title="alpha-fetoprotein">AFP</abbr>)</h4>

<p>A low level of <abbr title="alpha-fetoprotein">AFP</abbr> in the maternal blood in the second trimester is associated with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>.</p>

<p>Levels of <abbr title="alpha-fetoprotein">AFP</abbr> are low in maternal blood in the first trimester and increase until about 32 weeks.</p>

<h4>Human chorionic gonadatropin (<abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr>) or free beta <abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr>
</h4>

<p>An increased level of <abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr> and/or the free beta subunit in the maternal blood in the first and second trimester is associated with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>. A decreased level is associated with <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>.</p>

<p>Levels of <abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr> increase with time after conception, reaching a peak at about 9 to 12 weeks. It decreases and evens out at about 20 weeks.</p>

<h4>Inhibin-A</h4>

<p>An increased level of inhibin-A in the maternal blood in the second trimester is associated with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>.</p>

<p>Levels of inhibin-A increase during the first trimester. Levels decrease to even out in the second trimester, before increasing again in the third trimester.</p>

<h4>Unconjugated oestriol (<abbr title="unconjugated oestriol">uE3</abbr>)</h4>

<p>A decreased level of <abbr title="unconjugated oestriol">uE3</abbr> in the maternal blood in the second trimester is associated with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>.</p>

<p>Levels of <abbr title="unconjugated oestriol">uE3</abbr> in the maternal blood increase during pregnancy, reaching a peak at term.</p>

<h4>Pregnancy associated plasma protein-A (<abbr title="pregnancy associated plasma protein-A">PAPP-A</abbr>)</h4>

<p>A decreased level of <abbr title="pregnancy associated plasma protein-A">PAPP-A</abbr> in the maternal blood in the first trimester is associated with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>.</p>

<p>Levels of <abbr title="pregnancy associated plasma protein-A">PAPP-A</abbr> increase quickly during early pregnancy and continue to increase slowly until term.</p>

<h4>Effect of vaginal bleeding on biochemical markers used in screening for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Current evidence suggests that the biochemical marker levels are not substantially changed in a woman with a history of vaginal bleeding.</p>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> recommends eligible women are offered the combined or quadruple test as usual.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Ultrasound measurements</h3>

<p>Gestational age is calculated from ultrasound measurements of either the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> or the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The measurements for <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>, <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> and <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> recorded on the screening request form must be the same as the stored ultrasound images.</p>

<p>For purposes of consistency, all ultrasound measurements should be reported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in mm to one decimal place (for example, a <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement of 61.0mm should not be reported as 61mm or 61.00mm; it must be reported as 61.0mm)</li>
  <li>as measured and not rounded to a whole number (for example, a <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement of 45.6mm should not be rounded up to 46.0mm or rounded down to 45.0mm; it must be reported as 45.6mm)</li>
  <li>accurately even if it is &lt; 1.0mm (for example, an <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement of 0.8mm is valid and should be reported as this)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Nuchal translucency (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> is the ultrasound appearance of a collection of fluid under the skin at the back of the baby’s neck. The thickness of the <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> is measured and used as part of the combined test to calculate the chance of having a baby with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> or <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement ≥ 3.5mm may be associated with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> and serious cardiac conditions.</p>

<p>For a woman who accepts the offer of the combined test, an <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement ≥ 3.5mm is usually associated with a higher chance result. In these cases, the blood sample must be taken, processed and the chance result calculated in the usual way. Referral, in line with local guidelines, must be made straight away and not delayed until the chance results are known. As soon as the chance results are available, they should be forwarded to the clinician to support discussion with the woman.</p>

<p>For a woman who declines the offer of the combined test, local guidelines should be in place for the clinical management of <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements ≥ 3.5mm and any unexpected findings on the ultrasound scan.</p>

<p>It is important to note a baby with an increased <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> may not have any of these conditions.</p>

<h4>Crown rump length (<abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is the ultrasound measurement from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). The gestational age is calculated from this measurement, as outlined in the <abbr title="British Medical Ultrasound Society">BMUS</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmus.org/policies-statements-guidelines/professional-guidance/fetal-measurements/" rel="external">Fetal size and dating: charts recommended for clinical obstetric practice (2009)</a> guidelines.</p>

<p>The combined test can only be performed when the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement is between 45.0mm and 84.0mm. The <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement must be used rather than a gestational age of weeks and days.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement is essential for the analysis of the biochemical markers in the combined test. It may also be used in the quadruple test depending on gestational age.</p>

<h4>Head circumference (<abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> is the ultrasound measurement of the circumference of the baby’s head. The gestational age is calculated from this measurement when the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is &gt; 84.0mm, as outlined in the <abbr title="British Medical Ultrasound Society">BMUS</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmus.org/policies-statements-guidelines/professional-guidance/fetal-measurements/" rel="external">Fetal size and dating: charts recommended for clinical obstetric practice (2009)</a> guidelines.</p>

<p>The eligibility criteria for the quadruple test is when the <abbr title="head circumference">HC</abbr> measurement is between 101.0mm and 172.0mm.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Laboratory information for the combined and quadruple tests</h2>

<p>All NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> screening laboratories must:</p>

</ul>

<p>The laboratory must include an annual vertical audit of an antenatal screening sample in its laboratory audit schedule.</p>

<p>The audit should randomly select a higher chance <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> or <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> sample. In laboratories providing both combined and quadruple testing it is acceptable for the annual audit to relate to either. Wherever possible this should alternate between the 2 tests.</p>

<p>The audit should include arrival and receipt of an antenatal screening sample at the laboratory and acknowledgment of higher chance results by clinical services.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> looks at <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 15189 and the screening requirements on behalf of PHE Screening <abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr> services and the NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr>. All NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> screening laboratories must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participate in external quality assurance (<abbr title="external quality assurance">EQA</abbr>) schemes accredited to <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/29366.html" rel="external">Conformity assessment – General requirements for proficiency testing schemes (<abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 17043)</a>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The laboratory must have a viable contingency plan to continue the provision of screening in the event of any failures to the laboratory service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Chance calculation software</h3>

<p>Screening laboratories in England must use software that meet the requirements of the NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/downs-syndrome-screening-risk-calculation-software-requirements">chance calculation software specification</a>.</p>

<p>This sets out all aspects that need to be included in a software package to give consistent chance results.</p>

<p>Some variables that are entered into the software are defined by the local user to take account of the reagents used for screening and the characteristics of the local population. These are decided by the laboratory with support from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service"><abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>The software used to calculate the chance result from the biochemical and ultrasound markers is complex. This is best provided and supported by commercial suppliers.</p>

<p>Laboratories must use chance calculation software that is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking">(CE) marked</a>. It must comply with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> directives and utilise software upgrades.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Data fields for the screening laboratory request form</h3>

<p>Laboratory request forms must include the required data fields outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook">‘Request form and data fields required when screening for Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome and Patau’s syndrome’</a>. The data fields highlighted in bold text must be provided to <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr>. However, all data items specified are helpful to <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> recommends all the required data fields are included when current request forms are revised. Software and data entry methods may vary.</p>

<h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Blood sample draw, transport and storage</h3>

<p>Blood samples taken for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> screening must be collected in a plain or gel serum separating tube (<abbr title="serum separating tube">SST</abbr>).</p>

<p>A screening blood sample must always be taken first if a full blood count sample is being taken at the same time. It is important that the correct order of draw is followed.</p>

<p>Tubes containing ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (<abbr title="ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid">EDTA</abbr>) must be avoided. This is due to significant interference of <abbr title="ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid">EDTA</abbr> in the immunoassays used to measure the biochemical markers for screening.
Blood samples must be processed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Free beta <abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr> can increase in concentration over time due to the dissociation of the intact <abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr> molecule. This effect is temperature dependent. The rate of deterioration of the sample increases with a rise in temperature. 
Serum samples are stable up to 72 hours at room temperature.</p>

<p>All samples transported or stored at room temperature for longer than 72 hours must be rejected.</p>

<p>The stability of the samples is significantly improved by refrigeration at 4 degrees Celsius, with whole blood and serum samples stable for several days. High temperatures (over 30 degrees Celsius) should be avoided as deterioration of free beta <abbr title="human chorionic gonadotropin">hCG</abbr> occurs within 4 hours of sample collection.</p>

<p>Most samples are stored and transported at room temperature. During periods of increased temperatures, providers should consider both storing and transporting samples in cool bags to reduce any effect on the markers. 
Whole blood samples must not be frozen or transported on dry ice as this makes the sample unsuitable for analysis.</p>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>If a gel separator tube is not used, it is good practice for the sample to be centrifuged and separated from the clot within 24 hours of collection.</p>

<p>If this is not possible, samples may remain as whole blood at room temperature for up to 48 hours. Samples received as whole blood after 48 hours from sample collection must be rejected.</p>

<h4>Screening sample stability acceptance criteria</h4>

<p>Whole blood (unseparated) samples can be stored at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>room temperature (20 degrees Celsius) for 48 hours</li>
  <li>4 degrees Celsius for 5 days</li>
</ul>

<p>Serum (separated) samples can be stored at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>room temperature (20 degrees Celsius) for 72 hours</li>
  <li>4 degrees Celsius for 14 days</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Analysers and kits</h3>

<p>There are several suppliers in the UK providing assays and analysers that are CE marked for use in <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> screening.</p>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> does not have a preferred supplier and laboratories must decide which analyser best meets their purpose.</p>

<p>Some assays are available on random access analysers which overcome the need to batch samples. All assays should be verified and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<p>Any deviations must be fully validated in compliance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/56115.html" rel="external">Medical laboratories – Requirements for quality and competence (<abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 15189)</a>.</p>

<p>Analysers must be maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a comprehensive maintenance record kept, preferably in an electronic format.</p>

<p>Standard operating procedures that would pass a <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> assessment must be in place in the laboratory. These should be for each assay and all procedures relating to the screening work of the laboratory.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Laboratory throughput</h3>

<p>The NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> requires a standalone screening laboratory to have a workload of at least 8,000 samples per screening test per year.</p>

<p>A high throughput, particularly where technology requires batching of samples, means that laboratories will be able to meet recommended turnaround times for results. Extended turnaround times can delay diagnosis and ongoing management options.</p>

<p>All laboratories with a workload of fewer than 8,000 samples per year for a specific screening test must be part of a network screening service for that test.</p>

<h4>Laboratory network screening service</h4>

<p>The total number of samples from all laboratories within a network screening service must be a minimum of 8,000 per screening test per year. Each laboratory in a network must have a minimum throughput of 2,000 samples per screening test per year.</p>

<p>Having a laboratory network screening service helps to improve the quality of the screening programme. The principle of a network allows laboratories with a smaller throughput to monitor performance while working in a consistent way to a common set of standards. It can develop capacity, technical expertise and proficiency in a safe and efficient way.</p>

<p>A laboratory network screening service must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be directed by a person with executive accountability and competence as assessed by <abbr title="UK Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>have a clear governance structure in place that integrates with the organisation’s governance and quality structures</li>
  <li>have a service agreement in place between laboratories and commissioners</li>
</ul>

<p>Each laboratory in a network screening service must have identical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>screening policies</li>
  <li>analytical procedures, such as analysers and kit lots</li>
  <li>chance calculation algorithms and population parameters (this does not include factor adjustments) in their chance calculation software</li>
</ul>

<p>The laboratory network screening service lead receives the combined 6 monthly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/downs-syndrome-screening-quality-assurance-support-service#report-types"><abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> detailed laboratory report</a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> assessment of laboratory performance</h4>

<p>An annual throughput of 8,000 samples is needed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>achieve effectiveness and statistical precision in the <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> assessment of laboratory performance</li>
  <li>enable <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> to give additional focused support where required</li>
  <li>detect and respond to biases in <abbr title="multiples of median">MoM</abbr> values in a timely manner</li>
  <li>enable <abbr title="screen positive rate">SPR</abbr> to be estimated reliably</li>
</ul>

<p>If laboratory throughput is small, <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr> cannot measure performance reliably.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Internal quality control (<abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Laboratories must have internal quality control (<abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr>) procedures in addition to the external quality assurance service provided by <abbr title="Down's syndrome screening quality support service">DQASS</abbr>. These should be performed frequently enough to enable timely changes.</p>

<p><abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr> procedures must be rigorous. They must be able to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>problems with the assays on a day-to-day basis</li>
  <li>problems such as a gradual drift of results with time</li>
  <li>changes that may occur when a new batch of reagents is used</li>
</ul>

<p>Manufacturer recommendations for <abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr> must be strictly adhered to as a minimum requirement. Additional controls should be included, especially if an assay is particularly difficult.</p>

<p>It is good practice to include validated <abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr> material from another manufacturer. Laboratories should not rely solely on the controls provided by the manufacturer of the assay kit.</p>

<p>Long-term trends in <abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr> data should be analysed to detect assay drift.</p>

<p>It is important to compare sample and <abbr title="internal quality control">IQC</abbr> results when a new batch of reagents is introduced. Significant shifts in population medians were observed on occasions with the introduction of a new reagent batch and after maintenance of an analyser. This can impact on the chance results reported if it is not anticipated and accounted for.</p>

<p>Vigilance is required at all times because chance calculation involves several biochemical markers. The measurement of each marker must be as accurate as possible. Small inaccuracies in these measurements can lead to a greater overall inaccuracy of the final chance result.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Ultrasound information for the combined and quadruple tests</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Ultrasound image archiving</h3>

<p>Every provider should save ultrasound scan reports and images onto an electronic reporting and archiving system. This system should be able to provide minimum audit data.</p>

<p>All imaging studies should also have an electronic report linked to the images.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Professional competence</h3>

<p>Ultrasound machines should be capable of producing images of diagnostic quality and include the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adequate display/screen size for clear visualisation</li>
  <li>magnification facility</li>
  <li>cineloop function</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Screening in twin pregnancies</h2>

<p>NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr> screening for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> is only available for singleton and twin pregnancies.</p>

<p>Guidance is produced by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg129/chapter/1-guidance" rel="external">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (NICE) on higher multiple pregnancies (triplets and more).</p>

<p>More than one baby in a pregnancy complicates screening.</p>

<p>Each feto-placental unit contributes to the levels of the biochemical markers used in the chance calculation. Each baby has an individual <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Combined test in twin pregnancies</h3>

<p>The test of choice for twin pregnancies is the combined test. Every effort must be made to offer and complete this test. Depending on a woman’s personal choice, <a class="govuk-link" href="#results">chance results</a> are reported as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a term chance of <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> and a joint term chance of <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a term chance of <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> only</li>
  <li>a joint term chance of <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> only</li>
</ul>

<p>In a monochorionic twin pregnancy, the chance result is the same for each baby and one ‘pregnancy’ chance result is reported.</p>

<p>In a dichorionic twin pregnancy, the chance result is reported for each baby.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Quadruple test in twin pregnancies</h3>

<p>The quadruple test is offered to a woman with a twin pregnancy to screen for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> only when one or both of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements cannot be obtained</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements are &gt; 84.0mm</li>
</ul>

<p>The quadruple test in twin pregnancies is not as sensitive as the combined test and the decision-making process can be more difficult for a number of reasons. Women considering the quadruple test should have a discussion with a healthcare professional with a special interest, experience and knowledge of managing multiple pregnancies. This is to help support <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/overview#choice">personal informed choice</a>.</p>

<h4>Monochorionic twins</h4>

<p>The performance of the quadruple test in monochorionic twins is comparable to that in singleton pregnancies.</p>

<h4>Dichorionic twins</h4>

<p>In dichorionic twins where one baby has the condition and the other does not, the performance of the quadruple test is not as sensitive as it is in monochorionic twins.</p>

<p>Quadruple test chance results relate to the pregnancy not to individual babies. They are not interpreted in the usual way but used, with a cut-off of 1 in 150 at term, to define a higher chance group.</p>

<p>An appropriately trained healthcare professional should interpret and explain these results and pregnancy options due to the complexities involved.</p>

<p>The risk of miscarriage is twice as high in twin pregnancies compared to singleton pregnancies.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-handbook/prenatal-diagnosis">Prenatal diagnosis (<abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr>)</a> is performed at a tertiary-level fetal medicine unit. This is due to the specialised nature of the procedure and the increased risk of miscarriage. This is in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/gtg8/" rel="external">Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (<abbr title="Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists">RCOG</abbr>)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng137" rel="external">NICE guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span>Vanished twin</h3>

<p>The definition of a vanished twin is when one fetus, in a twin pregnancy, is non-viable. It may be partially or completely reabsorbed.</p>

<p>An ultrasound scan for the combined or quadruple test may show either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an empty second pregnancy sac</li>
  <li>a second pregnancy sac containing a non-viable fetus</li>
</ul>

<h4>Empty second pregnancy sac and the combined test</h4>

<p>When there is an empty second pregnancy sac, the combined test can be used to calculate the chance result. This is because it is assumed the biochemical markers are not significantly different from those in a singleton pregnancy.</p>

<h4>Second pregnancy sac containing a non-viable fetus and the combined test</h4>

<p>When there is a second pregnancy sac containing a non-viable fetus, the combined test should not be used to calculate the chance result. This is because the non-viable fetus can contribute to the maternal biochemical markers for many weeks. This may affect the sensitivity of the test.</p>

<p>The quadruple test can be offered or local guidance should be in place for the specialist clinical management of these pregnancies. For example, use of <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurement and maternal age alone.</p>

<h4>The quadruple test</h4>

<p>The quadruple test can be offered to a woman with a vanished twin pregnancy.</p>

<p>This is because the <abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr> of the quadruple test is unlikely to be reduced in a vanished twin pregnancy. Levels of inhibin and <abbr title="alpha-fetoprotein">AFP</abbr> can be increased in these pregnancies. However, given that inhibin is increased and <abbr title="alpha-fetoprotein">AFP</abbr> is decreased in a pregnancy with <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr>, these effects tend to cancel each other out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Screening in in-vitro fertilisation (<abbr title="in-ivtro fertilisation">IVF</abbr>) pregnancies</h2>

<p>The eligibility criteria for the combined test in <abbr title="in-ivtro fertilisation">IVF</abbr> pregnancies is when the <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> is between 45.0mm and 84.0mm. The <abbr title="crown rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement must be used for the purposes of screening.</p>

<p>The quadruple test is also performed in <abbr title="in-ivtro fertilisation">IVF</abbr> pregnancies.</p>

<p>Maternal age in <abbr title="in-ivtro fertilisation">IVF</abbr> pregnancies using donor eggs is calculated from the date of birth or age of the donor at the time of egg collection. This is required for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/downs-syndrome-screening-risk-calculation-software-requirements">calculation of prior chance</a>.</p>

<p>Calculating the estimated due date (<abbr title="estimated due date">EDD</abbr>) of an <abbr title="in-ivtro fertilisation">IVF</abbr> pregnancy is not part of the NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr>. Local guidelines should be in place to date these pregnancies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Screening results</h2>

<p>Chance results from combined or quadruple tests must only be recalculated in exceptional circumstances. For example, incorrect data on the screening request form.</p>

<p>All higher chance results and/or significant findings on ultrasound scan must be reported and followed up in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-standards">screening standards</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fetal-anomaly-screening-programme-standards/fetal-anomaly-screening-standards-valid-from-1-april-2020#fasp-s07-referral-time-to-intervention-t21t18t13-screening">Referral standard <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr>-S07</a> outlines communication timeframes for higher chance results.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Chance cut-off</h3>

<p>Chance cut-off determines whether a woman has a lower chance or higher chance result.</p>

<p>The chance cut-off is 1 in 150 at term for both the combined and quadruple tests, as defined by the NHS <abbr title="fetal anomaly screening programme">FASP</abbr>.</p>

<p>A lower chance result is ≤ 1 in 151.</p>

<p>A higher chance result is ≥ 1 in 150 (between 1 in 2 and 1 in 150).</p>

<p>A woman with a higher chance result is offered a <abbr title="prenatal diagnosis">PND</abbr> test, such as <abbr title="chorionic villus sampling">CVS</abbr> or amniocentesis.</p>

<p>The cut-off is based on a chance at term, rather than a chance at the time of the screening test. The chance at the time of screening is not known because there is significant pregnancy loss between the time of screening and birth. This loss rate is not known.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Combined test chance results</h3>

<p>Depending on the woman’s screening choice, the following chance results are reported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a term chance for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> and a joint term chance for <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a term chance for <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> only</li>
  <li>a joint term chance for <abbr title="trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome)">T18</abbr> and <abbr title="trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)">T13</abbr> only</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>Quadruple test chance results</h3>

<p>For a woman screened using the quadruple test a single term chance of <abbr title="trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome)">T21</abbr> is reported.</p>
