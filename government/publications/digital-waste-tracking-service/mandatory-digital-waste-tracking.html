<p>We plan to introduce mandatory digital waste tracking across the UK. This is a commitment outlines in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england?msclkid=a3ab773ea92611eca9ea5b5dee85a4a2">Resources and waste strategy for England</a>. This will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a comprehensive way to see what is happening to the waste produced in the UK</li>
  <li>help support more effective regulation of waste</li>
  <li>help businesses comply with their duty of care with regards to waste</li>
  <li>help us move towards a more circular economy by enabling us to maximise the value we extract from our resources</li>
  <li>reduce the ability for waste criminals to operate and undercut legitimate businesses through their systemic mis-handling of waste, illegal exports, and flytipping</li>
</ul>

<p>We will have information about where and how waste is created, who is handling it, what is done to it, and where it ends up.</p>

<p>We are working towards a target date of 2023 to 2024 to launch the digital waste tracking service Exact timings will depend on progress with the IT development and the transition needs of businesses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Our vision and mission</h2>

<p>Our vision is to make it easy to track waste and resources in real time throughout the economy.</p>

<p>Our mission is to deliver a waste tracking service that is simple to use and provides value for all users.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Benefits of change</h2>

<p>Mandatory digital waste tracking will help businesses and government move towards a circular economy by joining up and digitising currently fragmented systems to provide a single comprehensive way of tracking the amount and type of waste being produced and where it ends up.</p>

<p>This will also support the effective regulation of waste, transforming the way environmental regulators monitor compliance, prioritise regulatory activities and help prevent waste crime, including fly tipping, deliberate misclassification of waste, illegal waste exports and the operation of illegal waste sites. It will also facilitate a more level playing field for legitimate waste operators.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Working in partnership</h2>

<p>Digital waste tracking is a UK wide initiative. Whilst waste policy is a devolved matter, the UK Government and devolved administrations have agreed to work together to introduce a UK wide waste tracking service to provide a single system across the UK. The environmental regulators in all 4 nations are also partners in this project and actively involved in the development of the service.</p>

<p>A consultation on electronic waste tracking has been undertaken jointly by the UK Government, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The purpose of the consultation was to present and seek views on our proposals for the service. We will use the feedback gathered to review and refine our proposals which will then be reflected in secondary legislation and shape the digital design of the waste tracking service.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/environmental-quality/waste-tracking/" rel="external">consultation</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Developing the new system</h2>

<p>The waste tracking service is being developed in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a> for digital services including UK government’s guidance on using open standards. We will use tools and infrastructure that are flexible, scalable, sustainable, and secure.</p>

<p>We will design the service based on user needs which have been developed and tested with users of the service. We are following an agile delivery plan which focuses on user needs with frequent iteration and testing to continually improve the service based on this feedback.</p>

<p>The IT service development is supported by a user panel representing waste producers, carriers, brokers, dealers, waste site operators, local authorities, and regulators from across the UK.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://defragroup.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9QqfQNqEnI7ecDQ" rel="external">sign up</a> to join our user panel where there will be opportunities for you to help shape the service by participating in user research and testing the system as it is being developed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Delivery timeline</h2>

<p>We are working towards a target date of 2023 to 2024 to launch the digital waste tracking service dependent on progress with the IT development and the transition needs of businesses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Impact on existing systems</h2>

<p>The introduction of a central mandatory service for digital waste tracking will allow us to decommission outdated legacy IT systems, for example, Electronic duty of care (EDOC) where this has already taken place.</p>

<p>The service will also improve the coverage, quality and timeliness of the data that is collected and facilitate more efficient and effective waste regulation and intervention by joining up and digitising currently fragmented, and mostly paper based, systems to provide a single comprehensive way of tracking the amount and type of waste being produced and where it ends up.</p>

<p>This will help support more effective regulation of waste, help businesses comply with their duty of care with regards to waste, help us move towards a more circular economy by enabling us to maximise the value we extract from our resources, and reduce the ability for waste criminals to operate and undercut legitimate businesses through their systemic mis-handling of waste, illegal exports, and flytipping</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Government strategy and commitment</h2>

<p>Digital waste tracking is included in key government commitments such as the Resources and Waste Strategy in England, and will contribute towards the aims of other key strategies such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">25 Year Environment Plan</a> – commits to exploring options to introduce electronic tracking of waste</li>

</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Supporting legislation</h2>

<p>We already have primary legislation in place which provides the powers to introduce mandatory digital waste tracking regulations (clauses 58 and 59 of the Environment Act 2021). These regulations can place requirements on relevant waste controllers, or a waste authority, to enter certain information related to the tracking of waste into the waste tracking service.</p>

<p>We will also be making a range of legislative amendments across the United Kingdom, including (but not exhaustively limited to) legislation relating to the waste duty of care, hazardous waste, transfrontier shipments of waste, waste permitting and licensing and in Wales the statutory use of WasteDataFlow by local authorities. The waste duty of care codes of practice will also need to be revised.</p>
