<p>Your project proposal should be based on the following:</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Women’s involvement in peacebuilding is an area that has traditionally been neglected. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/docs/2000/10/un-security-council-resolution-1325" rel="external">UN Security Council Resolution 1325</a> formally linked women to the peace and security agenda and made clear the need for involvement of women in conflict resolution and peace making. This new project will focus on promoting women’s involvement in peacebuilding within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Women are central in building support for and increasing political prospects of achieving the 2 state solution.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>Increased prominence and amplification of women’s voices in positive discussions around peace and dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis in Israeli public debate.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>The funding period is 15 July 2022 to 31 March 2023.</p>

<p>The project will be managed under an Accountable Grant Agreement. Projects in this framework are not allowed to generate a profit for the delivery partner. Proposals from for-profit organisations can only be considered if an officially registered non-profit making arm or division of the for-profit organisation will deliver the project.</p>

<p>The successful bidder must be willing to engage closely with the British Embassy in Israel and our independent project evaluators. It must commit to deliver a project in line with HMG policy. This will include close cooperation during the inception and recruitment period.</p>

<p>The project should work with Israeli participants across society, and involve engagement with Palestinians (though not necessarily as project participants themselves). The proposal must demonstrate how the project benefits both Israelis and Palestinians. Bidders must demonstrate that they have an existing, diverse network in place to identify relevant participants.</p>

<p>Submitting a proposal for this call for bids will not prejudice any pending or future bids.</p>

<h3>Bidding process</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Proposals should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:beta.bids2022@gmail.com">aneurin.jones@fcdo.gov.uk</a> by 18 July 2022. In the email subject line and file names, please indicate the name of the bidder.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Budget</h2>

<p>The maximum funding for the project is up to GBP 380,000 in financial year 1 - FY 22/23 (July 2022 to March 2023). This may be in addition to co-funding and self-funding contributions. £380,000 is the maximum, however we will consider smaller bids and may decide to implement grants for up to 2 projects up to a total of £380,000.</p>

<p>Bidders are required to differentiate in the Annual Budget between their:</p>

<p>(a) Administrative Costs (e.g.: general administration and support costs; office maintenance, repair and running costs; accountants, HR, and senior managers; other cross-cutting staff costs not directly attributable to a single project and are shared across the implementer’s business platform and any mandatory operational or legal costs incurred by an implementer in order to operate in a given location administrative staff salaries, office maintenance, repair and running costs)</p>

<p>(b) Project Costs which should include all project associated costs including implementing staff costs, travel, M&amp;E costs. Please explain clearly, what you have included in each category</p>

<p>Administrative costs must not exceed 10% of the total project budget.</p>

<h2>Evaluation criteria</h2>

<p>Successful bids must demonstrate strong strategic relevance to the project outcome and objective, and have a clear focus on delivering change and sustainability.</p>

<p>Proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strategic fit to project objective - the extent to which the proposal addresses the issues</li>
  <li>quality of project - the strength of the Theory of Change, and the monitoring and evaluation framework</li>
  <li>value for money - the value of the expected project outcomes</li>
  <li>expertise - Evidence of: understanding of the context; ability to manage and deliver a successful project that includes dissemination activities and engagement across society, and an existing network of relevant connections</li>
  <li>gender-sensitive approach - bidders should identity the gender implications of the project, and demonstrate how this is taken into account in the proposal</li>
  <li>sustainability: an explanation of how the project outcomes will continue to have impact beyond the lifetime of the project</li>
  <li>risk management- the extent of which the proposal identifies serious risks, together with a management strategy.
Note: This must include information on how the project would deliver its activities and outcomes under:
    <ul>
      <li>different COVID-19 scenarios - including the potential for further outbreaks and restrictions that could impact project activities</li>
      <li>different political scenarios - including ongoing domestic political instability, further elections and escalation of armed conflict</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
