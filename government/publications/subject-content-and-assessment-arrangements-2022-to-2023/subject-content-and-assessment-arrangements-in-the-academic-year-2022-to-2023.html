<p>In 2021 and 2022, Ofqual made <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/arrangements-for-non-exam-assessment-for-qualifications-in-2022/consultation-arrangements-for-non-exam-assessment-and-fieldwork-requirements-for-students-entering-qualifications-in-2022">a range of adjustments to the arrangements for NEA and fieldwork and practical science requirements</a> in some GCSE, AS and A level subjects to respond to public health measures. Given that they are no longer in force, for the 2023 cohort Ofqual confirms that, as planned, the usual arrangements for NEA, fieldwork and practical science are now in place.</p>

<p>For the 2022 cohort, the Department for Education determined that there should be a choice of topics in GCSE English literature, history and ancient history and a choice of content in GCSE geography as part of a range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2022/outcome/decisions-proposed-changes-to-the-assessment-of-gcses-as-and-a-levels-in-2022">adaptations to GCSE, AS and A levels for this year</a>. For 2023, the Department for Education confirms the return to full subject content coverage for those GCSE subjects.</p>

<p>For other qualifications, including vocational and technical qualifications taught alongside or instead of GCSEs, AS and A levels, a range of adaptations were permitted in academic year 2021 to 2022. Awarding organisations decided which adaptations were appropriate for their qualifications in accordance with Ofqual’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vocational-and-technical-qualifications-contingency-regulatory-framework">Vocational and Technical Qualifications Contingency Regulatory Framework (VCRF)</a>. Some adaptations were in response to public health restrictions. Given that public health restrictions are no longer in place, these adaptations are no longer necessary for the academic year 2022 to 2023 onwards.</p>

<p>This means that schools and colleges have the information they need to plan their teaching of the required content and to provide non-exam assessments. The Department for Education and Ofqual will continue to monitor the path and impact of the pandemic and evaluate the delivery of arrangements this year, including the provision of exam aids, such as formulae sheets, and advance information to support students’ revision, before finalising 2023 arrangements. Our intention is to return to the carefully designed and well-established pre-pandemic assessment arrangements as quickly as possible, given they are the best and fairest way of assessing what students know and can do.</p>

<p>For GCSEs, AS and A levels, Ofqual will, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/ofquals-approach-to-grading-exams-and-assessments-in-summer-2022-and-autumn-2021">as planned</a>, consider the approach to grading for 2023 in light of outcomes in 2022. Ofqual will also ask exam boards to look carefully at the design of the exam timetable for next year in the light of experience this year, to see if the increased spacing between subjects in the exam timetable should be retained.</p>
