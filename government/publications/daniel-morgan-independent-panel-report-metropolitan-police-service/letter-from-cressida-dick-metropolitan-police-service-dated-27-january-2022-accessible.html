<h3>
<span class="number">27th </span> January 2022</h3>

<p>As you know, the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel (DMIP) published their report last June. Since
then the Met has made significant progress and I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with
an interim update ahead of a more significant report expected in March 2022. This update builds on
my previous correspondence sent to you in July.
.
I want to start by once again recognising the impact that the Met’s failures to bring anyone to justice
for the murder of Daniel Morgan has had on his family; the depth of their hurt and loss is
unimaginable. As you know I have written to the Morgan family to personally apologise and have
offered to meet with them should they wish. As part of our recognition of the importance of keeping
the Morgan family up to date with our response to the report, we have provided written updates to
the family on a number of occasions since June and we will continue to do this.</p>

<p>As you are aware, I asked Deputy Assistant Commissioner Barbara Gray to lead the Met’s response to
the DMIP report (Op Drayfurn). We have developed a robust governance model and established
external challenge through the creation of a Professional Reference Group.</p>

<p>I am pleased that we have made substantial progress since the report’s publication last summer. By
March we will be working to embed relevant policy updates and training requirements from the
recommendations throughout our organisation. In order to ensure thorough embedding, this work
will continue into the next financial year.</p>

<p>We have sought to work closely with national policing partners including the College of Policing (CoP)
and National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) on those recommendations relevant to national policing.</p>

<p>Annex 1 provides a summary of our activity to date against each of these recommendations.
In addition to progressing the recommendations for the Met and working with national policing
partners, we have supported Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue
Services (HMICFRS) Inspection. The terms of reference for this inspection were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How well does the MPS prevent, manage, understand, and investigate potential corruption?
(including how the MPS addresses and supports officers and staff who wish to raise a concern)</li>
  <li>How effective was the MPS’ organisational learning response to the Daniel Morgan
independent investigations and reviews?</li>
  <li>How appropriately did the MPS respond to the independent panel’s requests for disclosure
and access to material?</li>
</ul>

<p>We understand that HMICFRS have completed their fieldwork and they are expected to formally
report in the spring. This report will in time play a key role in providing assurance to our communities
of the Met’s systems and approach. We are committed to acting on the Inspectorate’s report in a
timely manner and, when necessary, prioritising resources to act upon recommendations which
support our wider work to Rebuild Trust in the Met. We shall rapidly consider any learning identified
in regards to our engagement with non-statutory inquiries to ensure all the support necessary for the
Dame Elish Angiolini inquiry.</p>

<p>In recent months with progress underway against each of the recommendations for the Met, we have
sought to place a greater focus on the Panel’s recommendations for national policing and other
organisations. During November, I hosted a roundtable event at New Scotland Yard; this event
brought together a number of organisations who were subject to the Panel recommendations. To
ensure an element of independence, I invited the College of Policing Chief Constable Andy Marsh to
facilitate the day.</p>

<p>Organisations represented included the National Police Chief’s Council, College of Policing, Home
Office, Crown Prosecution Service and the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office. The
Independent Office for Police Conduct forwarded their apologies and have committed to attend future
events. The Deputy Mayor of Policing and Crime and a member of the Professional Reference Group
(Chair of the London Ethics Panel) attended to provide external challenge. Each representative present
updated on their organisation’s progress against the recommendations. To maintain the progress,
commitment and momentum of all organisations a follow up event is scheduled for February 2022.</p>

<p>The Operation Drayfurn team are working closely with the Met’s Rebuilding Trust program to ensure
that we are considering cross cutting themes in a strategic way, maximising the opportunity to drive
change where we identify a need.</p>

<p>I hope this update demonstrates the significant progress we have made since the Report was
published and our ambition to respond in a considered and thorough manner. We are determined to
progress with the Met’s recommendations and we will continue to play our role in bringing together
the other organisations subject to recommendations.</p>

<p>I would welcome an opportunity to update you further on our progress at any time.</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Cressida Dick</h3>

<h3>Commissioner</h3>
