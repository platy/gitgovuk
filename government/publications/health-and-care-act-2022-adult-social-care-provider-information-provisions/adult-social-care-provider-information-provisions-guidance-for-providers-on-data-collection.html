<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic exposed challenges in bringing together data needed to effectively manage outbreaks and ensure that emerging risks and issues could be identified at all levels and appropriate action taken. This has highlighted the importance of having robust data flows in the adult social care (<abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr>) sector to provide assurance that local and national government have the data and local intelligence to provide oversight and national support where it is needed in the longer term.</p>

<p>We need quality and timely <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> data that is collected to high standards and is transparent and accessible to all who need it to support high-quality commissioning, systems assurance and the management of risks at local, regional and national levels. This will help to ensure that nationally, regionally, locally and at provider-level, <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> data is used to benefit the system and support people who draw on care and support to make informed choices about their care. In collaboration with the Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group (<abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr>), we will consider mechanisms to make clear how the data is being used centrally.</p>

<p>Many bodies currently collect information but there is little standardisation in how it is collated, shared and used. The current aggregated data collected by local authorities shows a significant gap that needs to be addressed to include people drawing on privately funded care and support. Doing so will help ensure a fuller picture and enable improved outcomes for all people receiving care and support.</p>

<p>In the government’s health and social care data strategy, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data">Data saves lives: reshaping health and social care with data</a>, we set out our vision to transform adult social care data so that people who draw on support have access to information and can make more informed choices about their care, and for their carers to have timely data so that they can provide the best possible care.</p>

<p>As outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform-white-paper/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform">People at the Heart of Care</a> white paper, access to reliable data is key to underpinning the government’s ambition for social care reform. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into sharp focus the need for high-quality data and information to be shared and used well. Prior to the pandemic, the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) had no comprehensive national source of data from providers on capacity, workforce status or numbers of people in receipt of care. Emergency data measures taken in response to COVID-19 have given us near real-time data to manage the pandemic and shown us the benefits of using data to respond to emerging risks and issues. Data from social care providers has been critical to the government’s COVID-19 response and will continue to be crucial to help us to understand capacity and risk in the care system, to judge when and how to target support to providers and ultimately to help facilitate the care of individuals across the care system.</p>

<p>Through technology and data strategies, and the Data Alliance Partnership, we are working to ensure the most efficient methods of data collection and improvement in the interoperability of systems. We have committed to ensuring that the data architecture underpinning the health and care system can easily work together to make more effective and efficient use of data.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/31/contents/enacted" rel="external">Health and Care Act 2022</a> received Royal Assent in April 2022. It includes:</p>

<p>1. A power for the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to require adult social care providers to provide information relating to themselves, to their activities in connection with the provision of <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> in England or to persons to whom they have provided such care (section 99).</p>

<p>This power will commence on 31 July 2022 and will apply to all <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers regulated by the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>). These are providers required to be registered under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 in respect of the carrying on of a regulated activity involving, or connected with, the provision of <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> in, or in relation to, England.</p>

<p>2. A power to make regulations enabling the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to impose a financial penalty on private providers that do not comply with an information request or provide false or misleading information without reasonable excuse (section 100).</p>

<p>It is intended that this power and the regulations will come into force from November 2022. Enforcement regulations will apply to all <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers regulated by the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Data collection</h2>

<h3>Information required from 31 July 2022</h3>

<p>From 31 July 2022 we will mandate a core subset of the data which providers have already been submitting through the Capacity Tracker (<abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr>). This will be gathered on a monthly basis. Providers will be required to update their data by the end of the 14th day of each month, or the next working day where the 14th falls on a weekend or public holiday. Data must be no more than a week out of date – that is, data must be correct to no further back than the 8th of each month.</p>

<p>The first set of monthly data will be due by the end of 14 August 2022.</p>

<p>Updates for this data will need to be made via the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> using the same method as at the time of this guidance’s publication – by providers either updating each mandated field individually or by the bulk update functionality. The data must be reviewed between the 8th and 14th day (or the next working day where the 14th falls on a weekend or public holiday) of each month, and, even if there are no changes to be made, the page is ‘saved’ so that it is marked in the system as having been updated.</p>

<p>As always, the department is regularly engaging with and consulting the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr> on improvements to the wording and content of specific data items and questions based on feedback received from <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers and data users. This is intended to ensure that any changes improve data quality and relevance, while also managing data burdens on providers.</p>

<p>Other data items in <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> are often key for local operational support and providers will be asked to provide more regular updates to these items – for example, confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases in staff and residents, vaccination updates, PPE availability, daily bed vacancy updates and workforce data. Such data requests are separate to the mandated list but are essential to continue to support you as providers, and health and social care partners, such as discharge teams, to keep people and staff as safe and healthy as possible. The daily vacancy data is useful when more frequent because it supports people to be in the right place for their specific needs.</p>

<p>By the time of the first mandatory collection, we will have made visual changes to the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> so that providers can clearly see which questions are mandatory and which are not.</p>

<p>For care home provider locations, the mandatory information will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>care home bed vacancies:
    <ul>
      <li>maximum capacity</li>
      <li>occupied or used</li>

    <ul>
      <li>number of staff known to have received this season’s flu vaccination</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcoming changes to COVID-19 vaccination data collection, from September 2022</h3>

<p>From September 2022, in recognition that vaccination policy has evolved, and recognising the launch of the autumn booster campaign, as announced in May 2022 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-provides-interim-advice-on-an-autumn-covid-19-booster-programme">JCVI provides interim advice on an autumn COVID-19 booster programme</a>), we will be changing the COVID-19 vaccination questions asked of providers.</p>

<p>For care home providers, COVID-19 vaccination questions will be replaced with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of directly employed staff known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of agency or bank staff known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of residents known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of directly employed staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
  <li>number of agency or bank staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
  <li>number of residents staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
</ul>

<p>For domiciliary care providers, COVID-19 vaccination questions will be replaced with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of staff known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>* The autumn booster questions will become mandatory in October 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>Full definitions, including how the new full primary course data is virtually the same as some current data and how we will ease the transition are at Annex A (below).</p>

<h3>Purpose of collecting this information</h3>

<p>Availability of good quality and timely data from <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers is essential to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting efficient commissioning and systems assurance</li>
  <li>managing national, regional and local risks</li>
  <li>assisting with evolving situations, like COVID-19</li>
  <li>ultimately, helping to facilitate the care of individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>Data mandation will build on the stronger data sharing practices we have built during the pandemic where providers have shared data and information via the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> tool. This has highlighted the importance of having robust data flows in the <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> sector to ensure that the right level of capacity and support is available for service continuity. It will support a consistent and transparent approach to the processing of data across privately and publicly funded care to support improved safety and quality of provision.</p>

<p>Data is needed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to support COVID-19 recovery</li>
  <li>monitor vaccination levels</li>
  <li>understand capacity and risk in the care system more generally</li>
  <li>determine when and how to target support to providers</li>
  <li>ultimately, help facilitate the care of individuals across the care system long term</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, during the pandemic, provider data sharing facilitated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flagging a need for a visit from a COVID-19 vaccination team – vaccination teams also used data to arrange visits directly</li>
  <li>highlighting issues with accessing flu vaccinations</li>
  <li>flagging PPE shortages</li>
  <li>receipt of targeted support from regional teams, using data from the workforce RAG status</li>
  <li>visualising and benchmarking your own provider data against local authority, regional and national data to understand how it compares</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergency data measures taken in response to COVID-19 gave us near real-time data to manage the pandemic and showed the benefits of using data to respond to emerging risks and issues – for example, in outbreak management and prioritising PPE supplies for providers in highest need.</p>

<p>Currently, providers are able to view their data in the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> and use this for benchmarking purposes, comparing against the local authority, regional and national aggregate. This provider view will be reviewed and improved to better meet provider needs and support them to realise the full value of their data, noting such needs will differ depending on provider characteristics. We will be seeking feedback from providers on how to improve this view using the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr> member organisations. Furthermore, we are keen to explore what wider data sources we can add to this view, to offer a richer source of data to providers that they would not be able to access without it.</p>

<p>Data also helps us to identify issues at an early stage and provide an evidence base for central government funding discussions. For example, <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> data on staff absence in January 2021 showed the need for support with recruitment and that additional staff hours were needed, one of the drivers of the £120 million Workforce Capacity Fund being established. <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> data also continues to be the best source of vaccination data, enabling our NHS partners to prioritise areas through current and upcoming booster campaigns.</p>

<p>With more and better data, we can plan the future care of our population and will have the potential to generate significant health and care benefits such as increased independence, improved quality of care, higher satisfaction for people drawing on health and care support, and more efficient use of funding. Improved data on the <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> workforce can also benefit recruitment, retention and equality policies.</p>

<p>We have carried out an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-care-act-2022-adult-social-care-provider-information-provisions">impact assessment</a> in relation to the financial implications of mandatory completion of the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Engaging on future changes</h3>

<p>The burden on <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers in providing data is a key consideration in all changes and our aim is to reduce the burden overall where possible, while also improving the information data gives. It is our intention that the data listed above will be the only data mandated during 2022 to 2023 and we will endeavour to keep to this. If the data needs of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or other <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> partners evolve or issues with data arise, wherever possible, we will give at least 3 months’ notice of any change to the mandated data listed above or to the frequency of collection before making it a legal requirement.</p>

<p>We are working with provider representatives to improve what is currently collected in terms of the workforce data items listed for mandation, and on an improved way of highlighting pressures within home care. This work is at an interim stage and appropriate notice will be given before any of these changes are part of the mandated dataset.</p>

<p>We intend to engage on changes with providers and representatives through the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr>. The <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr> has met fortnightly since the start of the pandemic and includes provider and local authority representatives and is expected to continue to advise on data changes. The <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> chairs <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr> meetings and the full member list is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Care Providers Alliance (CPA)</li>
  <li>Home Care Association (HCA)</li>
  <li>National Care Forum (NCF)</li>
  <li>Care Association Alliance (CAA)</li>
  <li>Care England</li>
  <li>Local Government Association (LGA)</li>
  <li>Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS)</li>
  <li><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr></li>
  <li>Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC)</li>
  <li><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr></li>
  <li>NHS England</li>
  <li>NHS North of England Commissioning Support Unit (NECSU)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a change to a data item or a new data item is required by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will first consider key criteria such as whether it can be obtained elsewhere, what any output will be used for and the benefit of collecting it for providers, settings and other sector partners. If the need is clear, an example of how the data item will appear in the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> will be shared with <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr> for feedback and further iteration as part of co-building.</p>

<p>Depending on the scale of the change, any engagement might be solely via email feedback, representations at a <abbr title="Capacity Tracker Data Advisory Group">CT DAG</abbr> meeting itself, or could involve workshop sessions. This iterative process seeks to refine the new or changed data item to a point where it is ready for development and adding to the collection. Once the process is complete, we will notify providers of the upcoming change, giving at least 3 months’ notice, where possible.</p>

<h2>Support and guidance</h2>

<h3>Filling in the Capacity Tracker</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> is managed by the North of England Care System Support (<abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr>) unit. <abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr> provides a dedicated support centre – Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm – to support care providers and wider stakeholder users of the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr>. If providers need support completing or updating the system, accessing or using the reports and analytics, they can reach out either by phone 0191 691 3729 or via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net">necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> has an integrated resource centre – all communications, user or help guides and video tutorials along with contact details for local System Champions can be found there.</p>

<p><abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr> also utilises regional leads that are split across the 7 NHS England regions. They run regular provider engagement sessions and have set up regional forums to help support continuous improvement of the system and support our user centred design approach.</p>

<p>For guidance relating to how to answer specific questions, you can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:capacitytracker-guidance@dhsc.gov.uk">capacitytracker-guidance@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Providers will be contacted when they have not updated their <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> data and will be offered support or advice on completing the return. This will be done via <abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr> as at present, or via other routes depending on the issue. Contact will normally be established via a combination of emails, telephone calls and <abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr> regional leads and local system champions.</p>

<p>For administrative amendments, account support and more, you can contact <abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr> directly already at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net">necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net</a>.</p>

<h2>Data use and privacy</h2>

<p>These provisions will not enable data to be sold to private organisations. Our intention is that data collected will be shared appropriately with organisations who need the data across the <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> sector (for example, local authorities, the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>, integrated care systems) to guide delivery, policy development and research in the area for purposes connected with the health or <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> system in England. We will continue to encourage all such partners to look to data in <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> in the first instance rather than instigating separate data collections covering similar data.</p>

<p>The information will be subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and statutory restrictions on disclosure. This includes not sharing commercially sensitive data without taking into account both the interests of the provider (or the person to whom that data relates) and the public.</p>

<p>Section 277A states that the provision of information under that section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>does not breach any obligation of confidence owed by the person providing it, but</li>
  <li>is subject to any express restriction on disclosure imposed by any enactment (other than a restriction which allows disclosure if authorised by an enactment)</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will seek to ensure that data requests comply with these principles including UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> but providers should take their own legal advice as necessary.</p>

<h2>Enforcement powers</h2>

<p>Specific guidance on enforcement will be published once the enforcement regulations are made and will be linked here once published.</p>

<p>Although we will be mandating data from 31 July 2022, we will not be rolling out the enforcement mechanism before November 2022.</p>

<p>Financial penalties will normally be a last step, which we anticipate using where both the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a provider continues to be, or is persistently, in breach of their data obligations</li>
  <li>our delivery partner (the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA)) has reached out to offer guidance and support, but the provider is still not sharing their data, and has not made appropriate attempts to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>The level of the fines will be the same as a provider’s <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> registration fee which is scaled to the provider type and size.</p>

<p>We expect that from the first concern, the enforcement process will happen over a period of months, rather than weeks. A provider will always be given the opportunity to make representations as to why they have not supplied the required data and why a financial penalty should not be imposed. Even after a final penalty notice is issued, we expect that providers may be able to avoid a fine by providing the data required.</p>

<p>A provider who has been issued with a final penalty notice will be able to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.</p>

<p>There may be rare instances where some of the required information cannot be updated by a provider because the information is not relevant to their setting, because the provider is no longer operating, or because the provider is unable to get that information, despite making reasonable attempts to do so. In those cases, we ask that the provider submits the information that they do know, or submits a nil return, and ‘saves’ the page so that it is marked in the system as having been updated, so that enforcement action is not pursued. What is most important is that the provider has made a reasonable attempt to provide the data they have.</p>

<h2>Annex A: COVID-19 vaccination question definitions</h2>

<p>A full primary course does not include COVID-19 boosters. For most people, a full primary course is defined as 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccination. For a small number of people, however, including people who were vaccinated abroad, people who have received a single-dose vaccination such as Janssen, or people who are severely immunosuppressed, a full primary course may mean a different number of doses.</p>

<p>As Capacity Tracker will no longer include a separate question asking for the number of care home staff who have been fully vaccinated abroad, individuals falling in this category should be recorded as having received a full primary course of COVID-19 vaccination, together with those who received it in the UK.</p>

<p>An autumn booster is defined as any booster delivered under the autumn booster campaign, expected to begin in September 2022, as announced in May 2022 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-provides-interim-advice-on-an-autumn-covid-19-booster-programme">JCVI provides interim advice on an autumn COVID-19 booster programme</a>).</p>

<p>When the question changes are implemented, Capacity Tracker will pre-populate the ‘full primary course’ fields by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for care homes, combining their existing data on the numbers known to have received a second dose of COVID-19 vaccination and the numbers self-certifying as fully vaccinated abroad</li>
  <li>for domiciliary care providers, pre-populating with their existing data on second doses</li>
</ul>

<p>As the ‘full primary course’ questions are virtually completely built from the data in existing ‘second dose’ questions for the vast majority of providers, these will form part of the mandatory data set from September 2022. They will be prepopulated with your data for 2nd dose plus, for care homes, data for staff self-certifying as being fully vaccinated abroad. The autumn booster questions will become mandatory in October 2022.</p>

<p>While COVID-19 vaccination data forms part of the mandatory provider dataset, we recognise that staff may choose not to disclose their vaccination status to their employer. Providers should complete Capacity Tracker with the numbers of staff who are known to have received a vaccination and are not asked to disclose the numbers not vaccinated and the numbers with unknown vaccination status.</p>
