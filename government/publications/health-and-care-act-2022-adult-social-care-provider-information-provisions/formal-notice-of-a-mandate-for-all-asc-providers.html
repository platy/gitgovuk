<h2>Formal notice of a mandate for all adult social care (<abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr>) providers: information required by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care from <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-regulated <abbr title="adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers, under section 277A of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, as inserted by section 99 of the Health and Care Act 2022</h2>

<p>Dear Colleague,</p>

<p>This notice sets out information required by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care under section 277A of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 with the first set of monthly data being due by the end of 14 August 2022.</p>

<p>From 31 July 2022 and until further notice, the Capacity Tracker (<abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr>) must be completed each month, with the information listed below.</p>

<p>Information is to be provided via the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> platform. You must do this by either updating each required field individually, or by using the bulk update functionality.

      <li>number of residents known to have had the second COVID-19 vaccination booster in the UK</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>flu vaccination (seasonal: 1 September to 31 March):
    <ul>
      <li>number of directly employed staff known to have received this season’s flu vaccination</li>
      <li>number of agency or bank staff known to have received this season’s flu vaccination</li>
      <li>number of residents known to have received this season’s flu vaccination</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>visiting:
    <ul>
      <li>if residents have been able to take part in visits in and/or out of the care home</li>
      <li>the visiting options currently being supported</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For domiciliary care settings, the mandatory information will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of people using the service today</li>
  <li>number of staff in the organisation that have face-to-face contact with the people being supported</li>
  <li>number of staff delivering care that are not working because of coronavirus</li>

      <li>number of staff known to have had the COVID-19 vaccination booster</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>flu vaccination (seasonal: 1 September to 31 March):
    <ul>
      <li>number of staff known to have received this season’s flu vaccination</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other data items in <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> are often key for local operational support and providers will be asked to provide more regular updates to these items – for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases in staff and residents</li>
  <li>vaccination updates</li>
  <li>PPE availability</li>
  <li>daily bed vacancy updates</li>
  <li>workforce data</li>
</ul>

<p>Such data requests are separate to the mandated list but are essential to continue to support you as providers, and health and social care partners, such as discharge teams, to keep people and staff as safe and healthy as possible. The daily vacancy data is useful when more frequent because it supports people to be in the right place for their specific needs.</p>

<h2>Upcoming changes to COVID-19 vaccination data collection</h2>

<p>From September 2022, in recognition that vaccination policy has evolved, and recognising the launch of the autumn booster campaign, as announced in May 2022 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-provides-interim-advice-on-an-autumn-covid-19-booster-programme">JCVI provides interim advice on an autumn COVID-19 booster programme</a>), we will be changing the COVID-19 vaccination questions asked of providers.</p>

<p>For care home providers, COVID-19 vaccination questions will be replaced with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of directly employed staff known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of agency or bank staff known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of residents known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of directly employed staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
  <li>number of agency or bank staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
  <li>number of residents staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
</ul>

<p>For domiciliary care providers, COVID-19 vaccination questions will be replaced with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of staff known to have received a full primary course of the COVID-19 vaccination</li>
  <li>number of staff known to have received an autumn booster*</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>* The autumn booster questions will become mandatory in October 2022.</p>
</div>

<h2>COVID-19 vaccination question definitions</h2>

<p>A full primary course does not include COVID-19 boosters. For most people, a full primary course is defined as 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccination. For a small number of people, however, including people who were vaccinated abroad, people who have received a single-dose vaccination such as Janssen, or people who are severely immunosuppressed, a full primary course may mean a different number of doses.</p>

<p>As Capacity Tracker will no longer include a separate question asking for the number of care home staff who have been fully vaccinated abroad, individuals falling in this category should be recorded as having received a full primary course of COVID-19 vaccination, together with those who received it in the UK.</p>

<p>An autumn booster is defined as any booster delivered under the autumn booster campaign, expected to begin in September 2022, as announced in May 2022 (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-provides-interim-advice-on-an-autumn-covid-19-booster-programme">JCVI provides interim advice on an autumn COVID-19 booster programme</a>).</p>

<p>When the question changes are implemented, Capacity Tracker will pre-populate the ‘full primary course’ fields by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for care homes, combining their existing data on the numbers known to have received a second dose of COVID-19 vaccination and the numbers self-certifying as fully vaccinated abroad</li>
  <li>for domiciliary care providers, pre-populating with their existing data on second doses</li>
</ul>

<p>As the ‘full primary course’ questions are virtually completely built from the data in existing ‘second dose’ questions for the vast majority of providers, these will form part of the mandatory data set from September 2022. They will be prepopulated with your data for 2nd dose plus, for care homes, data for staff self-certifying as being fully vaccinated abroad.</p>

<h2>Future changes to the data set</h2>

<p>It is our intention that the data listed above will be the only data mandated during 2022 to 2023. As <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s data needs evolve, we aim to give at least 3 months’ notice to stakeholders before making the new data need a legal requirement, as far as possible.</p>

<h2>Failure to comply</h2>

<p>Failure to provide the information in accordance with the requirements will amount to a breach of the duty under section 277A to provide the information.</p>

<p>Breach of the duty under section 277A could also result in enforcement action by way of imposition of financial penalties once relevant regulations are in force. The intention is that, subject to Parliament’s approval, regulations will be made under section 277E of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, providing for a financial penalty to be imposed on a provider who without reasonable excuse fails to comply with a requirement to provide information or provides information that is false or misleading to a material extent.</p>

<p>You will be contacted if you have not provided or updated the information required above on the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> by the deadline and, as the <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> cannot be completed retrospectively, you will be offered support and advice on completing the next return. Once the regulations under section 277E are in force, if you continue to be in breach, or persistently fail to provide or update your data, enforcement action will be taken under those regulations.</p>

<p>Contact will normally be established via a combination of emails, telephone calls and North of England Care System Support (<abbr title="North of England Care System Support">NECS</abbr>) regional leads and local system champions, to your named contact for <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> and/or your registered manager from the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> Registry.</p>

<p>Please review your contact details on <abbr title="Capacity Tracker">CT</abbr> as we will be sending regular updates to your registered email.</p>
