<h2>Who is collecting my data?</h2>

<p>The data controller is Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) and they have appointed the Marine Management Organisation (<abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>) as a data processor that will help to collect the required data in order to administer the UK Seafood Fund. Throughout this document use of the phrase “we”, “our” or “us” means <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> as data controller, though in practice many of the administration tasks will be carried out by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> on our behalf.</p>

<p>When applying for a grant, your personal information will be input to and processed in the Fisheries Support System by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> in order to assess your eligibility for the UK Seafood Fund.</p>

<p>The Data Protection Officer that is responsible for monitoring <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> and <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>’s compliance with Data Protection Legislation in relation to the administration of the UK Seafood Fund can answer questions about how we us your personal data and your associated rights.</p>

<h2>What of my data is being collected and how is it used? What is the legal basis for the processing?</h2>

<p>This can include your name, date of birth, email address, telephone number, home address, business address and full contact details, copies of your passport, driving license and utility bills, VAT Status, bank account details, employment activities, vessel ownership and registration details.</p>

<p>We will only use your personal information to assess any grant applications you submit to the Fisheries Support System for eligibility and for grant claims to determine that you have defrayed the eligible expenditure in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in your offer of grant letter.</p>

<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us (as the data controller) to enable grant decisions and payments to be made.</p>

<h2>Who will my data be shared with?</h2>

<p>We will share information collected in the Fisheries Support System under available grant schemes, which include the UK Seafood Fund and the Inshore Vessel Monitoring System scheme with other Government Departments (including Marine Scotland, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) and the Welsh Government) and Agencies, such as <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> and the Environment Agency, to comply with the grant scheme Regulations and to enable grant payments to be made.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of your personal data is a priority. Although they can never be fully guaranteed, we ensure security measures are applied to keep your personal data secure. We also ensure your information will only be shared with third parties where an information sharing agreement exists which contains obligations regarding the security measures they apply to the personal data they are processing.</p>

<p>The information you provide in your application may be used by us or our contractors to evaluate the grant scheme. The information you provide will be treated in the strictest of confidence and not shared further except as described in this Privacy Notice. In applying for one of the available grants in the Fisheries Support System, you also agree to being contacted by us or our contractors to optionally participate in the scheme evaluation. We routinely evaluate our programmes in order to learn how to best deliver such interventions in the future. There are no adverse consequences to your application if you choose not to participate in this evaluation.</p>

<p>As a public authority, in certain situations, we may also be required by law to disclose information about you to other public authorities. For example, information may be disclosed where this is required to meet HMRC statutory requirements, any national security and/or law enforcement requirements.</p>

<p>However, any personal data shared under the UK Seafood Fund is only to the extent, and in such manner, as is necessary for the purposes of the grant scheme or as is required by Law.</p>

<p>In addition, we may also use your information for other legitimate purposes in line with the General Data Protection Regulation 2018, Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.</p>

<h2>How long will my data be held for?</h2>

<p>Your personal data will be kept by us for 7 years from the date that your grant scheme activity is fully completed (i.e. granted or declined) in line with our standard information retention policy. After this time period your personal information will be deleted.</p>

<h2>What will happen if I don’t provide the data?</h2>

<p>Failure to provide the information we request will prevent us from progressing your application(s) for available grant schemes in the UK Fisheries Support System.</p>

<h2>Will my data be used for automated decision-making or profiling?</h2>

<p>The provision of the information you provide is not connected with automated decision making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement) or profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual).</p>

<h2>Will my data be transferred outside of the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>? If it will, how will it be protected?</h2>

<p>The data you provide will not be transferred outside of the UK or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>. On rare occasions, when it is lawful and complementary to our work carried out in the public interest, such as enforcement, verification of documentation outside (UK or <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>), research data may be transferred securely outside of the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> but this will always be in line with requirements specified in the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>What are my rights?</h2>

<p>You have the right to request information about how your personal data are processed, and to request a copy of that personal data including in a portable form. You have the right to request that any inaccuracies in your personal data are rectified without delay. You have the right to request that any incomplete personal data are completed, including by means of a supplementary statement. You have the right to request that your personal data are erased if there is no longer a justification for them to be processed. You have the right in certain circumstances (for example, where accuracy is contested) to request that the processing of your personal data is restricted.</p>

<p>Where the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us as data controller, such as the exercise of a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department; the exercise of a function conferred on a person by an enactment; the exercise of a function of either House of Parliament; or the administration of justice: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data.</p>

<p>A list of your rights under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" rel="external">General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), is accessible on the Information Commissioner’s Office’s website.</a></p>

<h2>How do I complain?</h2>

<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (supervisory authority) at any time. Should you wish to exercise that right, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" rel="external">full details are available on the Information Commissioner’s Office’s website.</a></p>
