<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>The UK is a party to the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are substances that persist in the environment, accumulate in living organisms and pose a risk to our health and the environment.</p>

<p>They can be transported by air, water, or migratory species across international borders, reaching regions where they have never been produced or used.</p>

<p>Substances listed in the convention are generally prohibited from production, marketing or use unless specific exemptions apply, or acceptable purposes have been agreed.</p>

<p>There is a process for parties to propose a substance for listing if they have gathered evidence that suggests it may be a POP.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;POPs&nbsp;Review Committee (POPRC), the technical scientific committee of the Stockholm Convention, then considers and further develops the evidence that the substance demonstrates POP characteristics.</p>

<p>If there is evidence that it is a POP, they then consider the socio and economic impacts of a ban or restriction and make recommendations to the Stockholm Convention Conference of Parties, which is held every 2 years.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Risk profiles (covering Annex E of the Stockholm Convention)</h2>

<p>The risk profiles have been drafted. These further elaborate on, and evaluate, the information submitted in the original proposals that recommended the substances listed below be restricted as&nbsp;POPs.</p>

<p>A risk profile sets out the evidence that these substances meet the criteria for a POP. We are interested in any information you have to support or challenge the evidence provided.</p>

<p>There is an opportunity to provide socio and economic information at a later stage in the listing process, but we would also be interested in any information on risk management measures, alternatives, costs, and benefits related to the use of the substances and justified requests for exemptions if no alternatives are available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Chlorinated paraffins with carbon chain lengths in the range C14 to C17 and chlorination levels at or exceeding 45 per cent chlorine by weight</h3>

<p>Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are manufactured substances consisting of predominantly linear chloroalkanes, with different degrees of chlorination and chain length distributions depending on application and feedstock.</p>

<p>This proposal is for any CP product that has constituents with 14 to 17 carbon atoms (C14 to C17) and a chlorination level at or exceeding 45% chlorine by weight (Cl wt.).</p>

<p>These congeners are the principal constituents of substances called ‘medium-chain chlorinated paraffins’ (MCCPs) in Europe, North America and Australia, and major constituents of several products manufactured in Asia (for example, CP-52).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), their salts and related compounds</h3>

<p>Long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), their salts and related compounds are members of the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemical class. Long-chain PFCAs and their salts are infrequently used in products.</p>

<p>However, there are reported limited uses including surfactant application and the production of fluoropolymers, the related compounds have been used in a range of applications, including in coating products, fabric and carpet protectors, textile impregnation agents and firefighting foams.</p>

<p>C9 to C14 PFCAs, their salts and related compounds may also be unintentionally produced during the manufacturing of PFAS, including those containing a carbon chain of less than nine carbon atoms, and in other industrial processes.</p>

<p>As a result, long-chain PFCAs may be present in certain products and articles as impurities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Chlorpyrifos</h3>

<p>Chlorpyrifos, is an organophosphate pesticide, it has been widely applied as an insecticide in agriculture and as a biocide to control non-agricultural pests. In 2008, chlorpyrifos pro­ducts were authorised for use in more than 88 countries.</p>

<p>However, in 2008, usage as a biocide was phased-out in the Europe, and in 2000, its use in most non-agricultural applications was phased out. However, usage as a biocide, for example, for termite control in buildings, is still practiced in other countries.</p>
