<h3>Version 3.0</h3>

<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance tells caseworkers how to consider applications to enter, remain or settle in the UK on the T2 Minister of Religion route.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed to be used alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix T2 Minister of Religion</a> of the Immigration Rules. The rules explain the requirements an applicant must meet, and this guidance provides additional information on how to consider their application. Paragraph references in this guidance refer to paragraphs in the Immigration Rules unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>Caseworkers may also need to refer to the following sections of the rules, where relevant:</p>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect the amendments to the paragraph numbers in Appendix T2 Minister of Religion in the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>Housekeeping changes and minor formatting amendments have also been made.</p>

<h2>Introduction to the T2 Minister of Religion route</h2>

<p>This page provides an introduction to the T2 Minister of Religion route.</p>

<p>The T2 Minister of Religion route is for a person who has been sponsored to perform a key leading role within a faith-based organisation or religious order in the UK.</p>

<p>A dependent partner and dependent children of a T2 Minister of Religion can apply on this route. See guidance on dependant applications.</p>

<p>This route can lead to settlement in the UK.</p>

<p>This route replaced the Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) route. Existing Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) workers can apply for extensions, changes of employment and settlement under the T2 Minister of Religion route.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>The requirements applicants must meet are split into 3 parts:</p>

<p>Validity requirements - these outline the minimum criteria that must be met for the application to be fully considered. They ensure, for example, the applicant has used the correct form and supplied their identity documents. Applications which do not meet these requirements are invalid and may be rejected.</p>

<p>Main applicant - entry clearance and permission to stay (MOR 1.1. to MOR 1.6.)</p>

<p>Main applicant - settlement (MOR 11.1. to 11.4.)</p>

<p>Dependants – entry clearance and permission to stay (MOR 18.1. to MOR 18.5.)</p>

<p>Dependants - settlement (MOR 28.1. to 28.3.)</p>

<p>Suitability requirements – these check the suitability of the applicant to be granted any form of permission, not specifically whether they qualify as a Minister of Religion. Applicants must not fall for refusal on general grounds or be in breach of immigration laws. Applications which do not meet these requirements should be refused.</p>

<p>Main applicant - entry clearance and permission to stay (MOR 2.1. to MOR 2.2.)</p>

<p>Main applicant - settlement (MOR 12.1. to 12.2.)</p>

<p>Dependants – entry clearance and permission to stay (MOR 19.1. to MOR 19.2.)</p>

<p>Dependants - settlement (MOR 29.1. to 29.2.)</p>

<p>Eligibility requirements - these are the main criteria specific to the T2 Minister of Religion route. Applications which do not meet these requirements should be refused.</p>

<p>Main applicant - entry clearance and permission to stay (MOR 3.1. to MOR 8.2.)</p>

<p>Main applicant - settlement (MOR 13.1. to 16.1.)</p>

<p>Dependants – entry clearance and permission to stay (MOR 20.1. to MOR 25.5.)</p>

<p>Dependants - settlement (MOR 30.1. to 36.1.)</p>

<h3>Representatives</h3>

<p>If an applicant has a UK based representative, the caseworker must check that the representative is approved to provide immigration advice with either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-immigration-services-commissioner">the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner</a> (OISC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one of the following designated authorities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/" rel="external">Law Society</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lawscot.org.uk/" rel="external">Law Society of Scotland</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lawsoc-ni.org/" rel="external">Law Society of Northern Ireland</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.barcouncil.org.uk/" rel="external">General Council of the Bar</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cilex.org.uk/" rel="external">Chartered Institute of Legal Executives</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.advocates.org.uk/" rel="external">Faculty of Advocates</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.barofni.com/page/governing-bodies" rel="external">General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland</a></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the representative does not have the necessary permission to provide immigration advice, the caseworker must direct all communications to the applicant instead.</p>

<h3>Requesting more information</h3>

<p>If the caseworker is in need of more information, or clarification of certain details, to be able to consider granting an application, then they should refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark78">requesting</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark78">more information.</a> Where possible, the caseworker should try to identify all areas where further information is required so it can be requested at the same time.</p>

<h3>Verifying documents</h3>

<p>The caseworker must conduct verification checks if they have any doubts about whether the supporting documents an applicant has submitted are genuine.</p>

<h3>Translating documents</h3>

<p>If the documents provided are not in English or Welsh, the applicant must provide a certified <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark83">translation</a>.</p>

<h2>Validity for entry clearance and permission to stay applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about the validity requirements that an applicant must meet when they apply for entry clearance or permission to stay (previously known as leave to remain) as a T2 Minister of Religion.</p>

<p>If the caseworker is not satisfied that the application meets all the validity requirements for a T2 Minister of Religion as specified in paragraphs MOR 1.1. to MOR 1.6., they should consider whether to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">request further information</a>, reject the application, or proceed to consider the application.</p>

<h3>Application form</h3>

<p>A person applying for entry clearance or permission to stay as a T2 Minister of Religion must apply online on the gov.uk website on the specified form as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for entry clearance, form “<a class="govuk-link" href="https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/apply-visa-type/tier2" rel="external">Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) visa</a>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for permission to stay, form “<a class="govuk-link" href="https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/tier2-minister-of-religion" rel="external">Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) leave to remain</a>”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The application</h3>

<p>An application for entry clearance or permission to stay as a T2 Minister of Religion must meet all the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any fee and Immigration Health Charge must have been paid</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant must have provided any required biometrics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant must have provided a passport or other travel document which satisfactorily establishes their identity and nationality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant must have a Certificate of Sponsorship that was issued to them by their sponsor no more than 3 months before the date of application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Application fees and Immigration Health Charge</h3>

<p>The applicant must have paid the relevant application fees and any Immigration Health Charge (sometimes called the Immigration Health Surcharge or IHS).</p>

<h3>Biometrics and identity documents</h3>

<p>The caseworker must be satisfied that where the applicant has provided their biometrics these are verified against a valid passport or other travel document they have supplied.</p>

Sponsors use a secure IT system called the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system</a> (SMS) to assign a CoS.</p>

<p>The reference number for the CoS should be provided in the application. If the applicant has not supplied the reference number, they must provide an explanation. If the caseworker is not satisfied that a CoS has been assigned to the applicant, they may reject the application.</p>

<p>The caseworker must check that the CoS was assigned to the applicant no more than 3 months before the date of application. If it was assigned too early, the application may be rejected.</p>

<p>For information on how to check the CoS information, refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">How to search the</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">CoS checking system</a>. Caseworkers should note that the CoS will also need to be viewed when assessing the Eligibility requirements.</p>

<h3>Age of applicant</h3>

<p>The applicant must be aged 18 or over on the date of application.</p>

<h3>Government or international scholarship agency awards</h3>

<p>Where an applicant has received an award covering fees and living costs from a Government or international scholarship agency in the 12 months before the date of application, the government or agency must provide written consent to the application. The letter of consent must be on the official letter-headed paper or stationery of the organisation or organisations, bearing the official stamp of that organisation and issued by an authorised official of that organisation. The documents must confirm the organisation gives the applicant consent to remain in or re-enter the UK.</p>

<h3>Switching</h3>

<p>An applicant who is in the UK cannot apply to switch onto the T2 Minister of Religion route if they have, or have last been granted, permission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as a Visitor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Short-term Student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Parent of a Child Student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Seasonal Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Domestic Worker in a Private Household</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outside the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, switching is now a validity requirement, not an eligibility requirement.</p>

<h3>Irish citizens</h3>

<p>Most Irish citizens do not need permission to live and work in the UK and therefore are not eligible to apply for permission under the Immigration Rules. The caseworker must reject any application for a visa from an Irish citizen as invalid, except where they are subject to any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a deportation order made under section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an exclusion decision, or an exclusion order made under regulation 23(5) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a travel ban implemented under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If an Irish citizen falls within one of the above categories, the caseworker should consider their application in line with the rules in the same way as any other applicant.</p>

<p>If further information is required, the caseworker should contact the CTA Policy Team.</p>

<h2>Suitability for entry clearance and permission to stay applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about the suitability requirements that an applicant must meet when they apply for entry clearance or permission to stay as a T2 Minister of Religion.</p>

<p>If the caseworker is not satisfied that the application meets all the suitability requirements for a T2 Minister of Religion as specified in paragraphs MOR 2.1. to MOR 2.2., they must refuse the application.</p>

<p>The caseworker must check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that the applicant does not fall for refusal under Part 9: grounds for refusal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that where the applicant is applying for permission to stay, the applicant is not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>in breach of immigration laws, except where <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-1-leave-to-enter-or-stay-in-the-uk">paragraph 39E</a> applies, that period of overstaying will be disregarded</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>on immigration bail</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Overstaying</h3>

<p>The caseworker must check the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except where permitted by the Immigration Rules in respect of periods of overstaying. Full guidance on overstaying is available.</p>

<h3>Immigration bail</h3>

<p>Any applicant who is in the UK on immigration bail is not suitable for the T2 Minister of Religion route. These individuals do not hold permission to be in the UK.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for entry clearance and permission to stay applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about the eligibility requirements that an applicant must meet to be granted either entry clearance or permission to stay as a T2 Minister of Religion.</p>

<p>If the caseworker is not satisfied that the application meets all the eligibility requirements for a T2 Minister of Religion as specified in paragraphs MOR 3.1. to MOR 8.2., they must refuse the application.</p>

<h3>Entry requirement</h3>

<p>A person seeking to come to the UK as a T2 Minister of Religion must apply for and obtain entry clearance as a T2 Minister of Religion before they arrive in the UK.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis certificate</h3>

<p>Where the application is for entry clearance as a T2 Minister of Religion, the caseworker must check that the applicant has provided a valid tuberculosis (TB) certificate with their application if they have been residing within a country listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t-tuberculosis-screening">Appendix T</a> of the Immigration Rules for the six months immediately preceding the application.</p>

<p>If the applicant has not supplied a valid TB test certificate when they are required to do so, the application should be refused under paragraph MOR 3.2.</p>

<p>Further information regarding which applicants are required to obtain a TB certificate before applying and the valid test centres can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">visa</a>.</p>

<h2>Points requirement</h2>

<p>This page provides an overview of how points are scored for T2 Ministers of Religion.</p>

<p>Under paragraph MOR 4.1., an applicant must score 70 points against the following requirements:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Points requirement</th>
      <th scope="col">Relevant rules</th>
      <th scope="col">Points</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
<a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark29">Certificate of Sponsorship</a>
</th>
      <td>MOR 5.1. to MOR 5.3.</td>
      <td>50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Financial requirement</th>
      <td>MOR 7.1. to MOR 7.3.</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
<a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark38">English language</a> skills at level B2 (intermediate)</th>
      <td>MOR 8.1. to MOR 8.2.</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All points are mandatory. If an applicant scores fewer than 70 points, the caseworker must refuse their application and explain where they have not awarded points.</p>

<h2>Certificate of Sponsorship requirement</h2>

<p>This requirement is met by having a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">valid</a> Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS).</p>

<p>This page tells caseworkers how to assess the CoS requirement for T2 Ministers of Religion, how to check that a CoS is valid using the CoS checking system and how to record it as used on the system.</p>

<p>The caseworker must award 50 points if the applicant has a valid CoS which sets out the specified details of the sponsorship. To award these points, the caseworker must be satisfied that the application meets the requirements in paragraphs MOR 5.1. to MOR 5.3.</p>

<p>The Certificate of Sponsorship must confirm all of the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant’s name, details of the job and salary and any other remuneration of the applicant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the job is as a T2 Minister of Religion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is qualified to do the job of a T2 Minister of Religion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is a member of the sponsor’s religious order (if the sponsor’s organisation is a religious order)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant will perform religious duties within the sponsor’s organisation or directed by the sponsor’s organisation in the UK (which may include preaching, pastoral and non-pastoral work)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant’s role will not involve mainly non-pastoral duties, such as school teaching, media production, domestic work or administrative and clerical work, unless the role is a senior position within the sponsor’s organisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that applicant will receive pay and conditions at least equal to those given to settled workers in the same role and compliant with, or exempt from, the national minimum wage</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Checking the validity of a CoS</h3>

<p>A valid CoS must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have been issued by a licensed sponsor that holds a valid T2 Minister of Religion sponsor licence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have been issued by an A-rated sponsor, unless it is an extension application to continue working for the same sponsor as in their last permission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have a reference number that links to a CoS checking service entry that names the applicant as the migrant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that the sponsor is sponsoring them on the T2 Minister of Religion route on which the migrant has applied</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have the same details as in the applicant’s passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have been assigned no more than 3 months before the date of application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have a start date no more than 3 months after the date of application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not have been used in a previous application which was either granted or refused (but can have been used in a previous application which was rejected as invalid, made void or withdrawn)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not have been withdrawn by the sponsor or cancelled by the Home Office since it was assigned</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Loss of sponsor licence</h4>

<p>If, while an application on the T2 Minister of Religion route is under consideration, the applicant’s sponsor loses its licence, the caseworker must speak with their manager and inform the applicant promptly.</p>

<p>The caseworker must only inform the applicant their sponsor no longer has a licence, not the reasons why. The only exception is if the licence was revoked for reasons directly linked to that particular application, and those reasons therefore, have particular relevance to the refusal.</p>

<h3>How to search the CoS checking system</h3>

<p>The caseworker can access the CoS checking system using their username and password. To access the search function, they should click ‘CoS check’. The CoS checker times out every 30 minutes, so they may need to log in again after this time.</p>

<p>The caseworker can search the system using the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CoS number, by entering it into the relevant screen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applicant’s details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sponsor’s details</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Searching using the applicant’s details</h4>

<p>If the caseworker selects this option they can search by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>passport or travel document number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>family name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>given name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nationality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date of birth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gender</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The more information that is provided, the narrower the search will be.</p>

<h4>Searching using the sponsor’s details</h4>

<p>If the caseworker selects this option they can search by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>sponsor licence number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sponsor name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sponsor address</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>postcode</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When the caseworker checks the CoS, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>find it on the CoS checking system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>check the case type given on the case working system matches the type of CoS issued - this can be found on the top of the CoS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>record it as used in all approval and refusal cases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not mark it as ‘used’ if they are rejecting the application as invalid, withdrawing or voiding the application, or the applicant is varying it to another route, because the T2 Minister of Religion decision has not been made and they could use it again</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Check the current status of the CoS</h3>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Length of the CoS</h3>

<p>The length of the CoS will depend on whether the applicant is applying for entry clearance or permission to stay. See the following links for further details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark54">entry clearance</a></p>

<h2>Genuine requirement</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers how to assess the genuineness of an application on the T2 Minister of Religion route.</p>

<p>When an applicant applies for entry clearance or permission to stay as a T2 Minister of Religion, the caseworker must be satisfied they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>genuinely intend, and are able, to undertake the role for which they are being sponsored</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do not intend to undertake employment other than in the role for which they are being sponsored, or as otherwise permitted at MOR 10.3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To assess this on the balance of probabilities, the caseworker may request, after confirming with their manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>additional information and evidence, and refuse the application if the information or evidence is not provided (the Home Office must receive any requested documents at the address given in the request within 10 business days of the date the request is made)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that an applicant attends an interview and refuse the application if they fail to comply with any such request without providing a reasonable explanation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The caseworker may take into account the applicant’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of the role</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relevant experience relative to skills required to do the role</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of the sponsor in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>explanation of how they were recruited</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other relevant information</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The caseworker will not need to take these actions for most applicants and will only do so when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>individual sponsors are assigning unusually large numbers of Certificates of Sponsorship for ministers of religion relative to their size or for the same type of role</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are reasonable grounds to believe the applicant will not be working in the role described on the Certificate of Sponsorship</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the job description on the Certificate of Sponsorship indicates the applicant will be mainly carrying out non-pastoral duties that might otherwise be done under the Skilled Worker route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>intelligence suggests applicants are linked to extremism, terrorism or trafficking</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Financial requirement</h2>

<p>This page explains how to assess the financial requirement (previously known as maintenance) for T2 Ministers of Religion.</p>

<p>The caseworker must award 10 points if the applicant meets the financial requirement. An applicant can meet the financial requirement in one of three ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are applying for permission to stay and have been living in the UK with permission for 12 months or longer on the date of application (see MOR 7.1.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their A-rated sponsor has confirmed on the CoS that they will, if necessary, maintain and accommodate the applicant up to the end of the first month of their employment, for an amount of at least £1,270 (see MOR 7.2.(b))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they provide evidence showing they have held funds of at least £1,270 for a 28- day period (see MOR 7.2.(a) and MOR 7.3.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>English language requirement</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about the English language requirement for T2 Ministers of Religion.</p>

<p>The caseworker must award 10 points if the applicant meets the English language requirement. The applicant must show English language skills of at least level B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages in all 4 components (reading, writing, speaking and listening), unless an exemption applies.</p>

<p>To assess whether the requirement is met, the caseworker should refer to the guidance on the English language requirement.</p>

<h2>Changes of employment</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers when a T2 Minister of Religion must make a change of employment application and how to consider these applications.</p>

<p>Where a person has permission on the T2 Minister of Religion route, the circumstances in which they can change their job without needing a fresh application are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9 of the Immigration Rules</a> (paragraphs 9.29.1 to 9.31.3). Other changes in job mean the person must re-apply with a new Certificate of Sponsorship for their new job. This is referred to as a “change of employment” application.</p>

<p>A person must make a change of employment application if they change employer. A person does not need to make a change of employment application if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are staying with the same employer and changing their job to one in the same occupation code, and the change does not mean moving from a job on the shortage occupation list to one which is not on the list</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their pay increases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are moving under Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) arrangements due to a takeover, merger or de-merger</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>under TUPE (or similar) protection they change jobs, the new job is in the same SOC code and the new salary continues to meet the appropriate rate for the new job as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-j-codes-of-practice-for-skilled-work">codes of practice</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they had an acceptable absence that lasted for one month or longer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the applicant has been subject to a TUPE transfer, the sponsor licence unit will check the transfer was done correctly. They will update the applicant’s CRS or CID shell record with the new sponsors details.</p>

<h3>Considering a change of employment application</h3>

<p>The caseworker must consider a change of employment application in the same way as an initial application.</p>

<p>The applicant must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide a new Certificate of Sponsorship from their new sponsor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet all the suitability and eligibility requirements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Supplementary and secondary employment</h2>

<p>This page explains supplementary and secondary employment on the T2 Minister or Religion route.</p>

<h3>Supplementary employment</h3>

<p>In addition to the job specified on the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), a T2 Minister of Religion’s conditions allow them to do extra work if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a job on the Shortage Occupation List in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Shortage Occupation</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">List</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a job in the same profession and at the same professional level as the work for which the CoS was assigned</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is no more than 20 hours per week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is outside the working hours covered by the CoS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the person remains working for the sponsor in the job for which the CoS was assigned</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the extra work meets the above requirements, the applicant does not need to inform the Home Office before taking extra work.</p>

<h3>Secondary employment</h3>

<p>A person with permission on the T2 Minister of Religion route can do a second (additional) job that does not qualify as supplementary employment (for example, it requires more than 20 hours work a week). They will need a new CoS for this second job and apply for a variation of permission, in addition to the CoS and permission for their existing job. This is because working in the second job is not covered by their existing conditions.</p>

<p>They cannot apply for further permission to stay for the second job until they have started working for their first sponsor. They will need to make a new application which must confirm they want to change their existing permission. The confirmation must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant’s name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date of birth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CoS reference number, from the current permission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation of the date when the current permission expires</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the caseworker approves their secondary employment, they will be varying the applicant’s initial permission and the applicant will have 2 sponsors during the period that both CoS are valid. Where the applicant has a biometric residence permit (BRP), the caseworker must arrange for a new BRP to be issued. Where the CoS</p>

<p>reference number is displayed, the card should now read ‘2 CoS as Letter’. This indicates that the applicant has secondary employment.</p>

<p>The caseworker must also change the applicant’s approval letter to state the primary and secondary sponsors and the employment end dates for each. The caseworker must tell the applicant they must keep the approval letter with their biometric card as proof of their right to work.</p>

<h2>Settlement</h2>

<p>This section explains how to assess settlement (previously known as indefinite leave to remain) applications on the T2 Minister of Religion route. The requirements applicants must meet are split into three parts: validity, suitability and eligibility.</p>

<h3>Validity for settlement applications</h3>

<p>If the caseworker is not satisfied that the application meets all the validity requirements for settlement as specified in paragraphs MOR 11.1. to MOR 11.4., they should consider whether to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">request further information</a>, reject the application, or proceed to consider the application.</p>

<p>When applying for settlement as a T2 Minister of Religion, the applicant must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>apply online on the gov.uk website on the specified form ‘Settle in the UK in various immigration categories: form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-settle-in-the-uk-form-seto">SET(O</a>)’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have paid the relevant application fee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have provided any required biometrics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have provided a passport or other travel document which satisfactorily establishes their identity and nationality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be in the UK on the date of application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have, or have last been granted, permission as a T2 Minister of Religion or Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) migrant</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Suitability for settlement applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about the suitability requirements that an applicant must meet when they apply for settlement as a T2 Minister of Religion.</p>

<p>If the caseworker is not satisfied that the application meets all the suitability requirements for settlement as specified in paragraphs MOR 12.1. to MOR 12.2., they must refuse the application.</p>

<p>The caseworker must check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that the applicant does not fall for refusal under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9: grounds for refusal</a> of the Immigration Rules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that where the applicant is applying for permission to stay, the applicant is not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>in breach of immigration laws, except where <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-1-leave-to-enter-or-stay-in-the-uk">paragraph 39E</a> applies, that period of overstaying will be disregarded</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>on immigration bail</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Overstaying</h3>

<p>The caseworker must check the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except where permitted by the Immigration Rules in respect of periods of overstaying. Full guidance on overstaying is available.</p>

<h3>Immigration bail</h3>

<p>Any applicant who is in the UK on immigration bail is not suitable for the T2 Minister of Religion route. These individuals do not hold permission to be in the UK.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for settlement applications</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about the eligibility requirements that an applicant must meet to be granted settlement as a T2 Minister of Religion.</p>

<p>If the caseworker is not satisfied that the application meets all the eligibility requirements for a T2 Minister of Religion as specified in paragraphs MOR 13.1. to MOR 16.1., they must refuse the application.</p>

<h3>Sponsor requirement</h3>

<p>The sponsor in the applicant’s most recent permission must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>still be approved by the Home Office to sponsor a T2 Minister of Religion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>they still require the applicant to work for them for the foreseeable future</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the applicant is paid, and will be paid for the foreseeable future, a salary at least equal to that paid to settled workers in the same role and compliant with, or exempt from, the national minimum wage</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualifying period requirement</h3>

<p>The applicant must have spent a continuous period of 5 years, before the date of application, in the UK with permission on any (or a combination) of the following routes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>T2 Minister of Religion / Tier 2 (Minister of Religion)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International Sportsperson / T2 Sportsperson / Tier 2 (Sportsperson)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Skilled Worker / Tier 2 (General)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representative of an Overseas Business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovator</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global Talent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)</p>

  <li>
    <p>Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent)</p>

    <p>Tier 1 (General)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tier 1 (Investor)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The most recent permission must have been on either the T2 Minister of Religion or Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) route. An applicant does not need to have switched from Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) to T2 Minister of Religion before applying for settlement as a T2 Minister of Religion, as the definition of a T2 Minister of Religion in the Immigration Rules includes those with permission in the Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) route.</p>

<h3>Continuous residence requirement</h3>

<h3>Knowledge of Life in the UK</h3>

<p>The applicant must meet the Knowledge of Life in the UK requirement as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix KOL UK</a>. They do not need to meet an English language requirement for settlement, as they will have met this in their previous T2 Minister of Religion application.</p>

<p>This page tells caseworkers how to grant or refuse an application for entry clearance on the T2 Minister of Religion route.</p>

<h3>Grant entry clearance</h3>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>falls for refusal under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9: grounds for refusal</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Administrative review</h4>

<h2>Grant or refuse entry at a UK port</h2>

<p>This page tells Border Force officers how to grant or refuse entry at a UK port on the T2 Minister of Religion route.</p>

<h3>Granting permission to enter</h3>

<p>Before the Border Force officer grants permission to enter, they must be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant has valid entry clearance or permission to stay in the UK on the T2 Minister of Religion route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are no reasons to believe the applicant gave false information to obtain the entry clearance or permission to stay in the UK, or that circumstances have changed since it was issued</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>none of the general grounds for refusal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9: Grounds for Refusal</a> apply</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Refusing permission to enter</h3>

<p>The Border Force officer must refuse under paragraph 9.14.1. of the Immigration Rules if someone seeks entry as a T2 Minister of Religion without a valid UK entry clearance for this purpose.</p>

<p>The Border Force officer must take into account the applicant’s continuing permission if they are considering refusing them after their return from a short absence abroad. The Border Force officer must consider the refusal under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9 of</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">the Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<h4>Appeal rights and refusal forms</h4>

<p>An applicant who has valid entry clearance (EC) or a biometric residence permit (BRP) which is cancelled at the border will not have a right of appeal against that decision. Where an EC or a BRP is cancelled the applicant may have a right to administrative review of that decision.</p>

<p>Where there is a right to administrative review at the border, the Border Force officer must serve an IS82 No RD AR in UK port cases and at the juxtaposed controls they must serve an IS82 JUXT AR.</p>

<p>Where the applicant has an EC or BRP and is having their permission cancelled at the border and does not qualify for administrative review, the Border Force officer must serve an IS82 RD no AR in UK port cases and at the juxtaposed controls they must serve the IS82 JUXT No AR.</p>

<p>Where the applicant does not hold an EC or BRP and there is no right to administrative review, the Border Force officer must serve the applicant an IS82 No AR RLE in UK port cases, and an IS82 JUXT No AR RLE at the juxtaposed controls.</p>

<p>If the applicant is the subject of an extant deportation order, they do not have a right of appeal before removal. The Border Force officer must serve them with form IS 82A, which they can find on CID.</p>

<h2>Conditions of permission</h2>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Voluntary work</h3>

<p>A person with permission on the T2 Minister of Religion route can do voluntary work in any sector. They must not be paid or receive other money for the voluntary work, except reasonable expenses as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/39/section/44" rel="external">section 44 of the National Minimum</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/39/section/44" rel="external">Wage Act</a>.</p>

<h3>Absence from employment</h3>

<p>Where a person with permission on the T2 Minister of Religion route has been absent from work without pay, or on reduced pay, for more than 4 weeks during any calendar year, the caseworker may cancel their permission, unless the reason for absence or reduction in salary is one of the following:</p>

<ul>

    <p>statutory maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave or shared parental leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>taking part in legally organised industrial action</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Requesting more information</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers about requesting more information or supporting documents related to T2 Minister of Religion applications.</p>

<p>Applicants and their sponsors should provide all the necessary evidence and information with the application and Certificate of Sponsorship. If, however, there is a clear error or omission with the supporting evidence provided, it may be appropriate for the caseworker to discuss the application with a manager to consider contacting the applicant to invite them to provide additional evidence or information.</p>

<h3>Taking a fair and proportionate approach to the assessment of evidence</h3>

<p>The caseworker must review the information on the application form and other available evidence before deciding whether they are satisfied, on the balance of probabilities (it is more likely than not) that a requirement is met.</p>

<p>If the applicant provides evidence that is meant to show a requirement is met and the caseworker is not satisfied the evidence is genuine, they should discuss whether to make further checks with a manager.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Official sensitive – start of section</p>
</div>

<p>The information on this page has been removed as it is restricted for internal Home Office use.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Official sensitive – end of section</p>
</div>

<p>Where evidence is found not to be genuine, caseworkers should consider the guidance on false representations.</p>

<h3>Format of evidence</h3>

<p>The Immigration Rules no longer set out specific format requirements for most documents. This doesn’t mean that format is irrelevant – it will help the caseworker assess if a piece of evidence is genuine and if it provides the information they need to be satisfied the requirement is met. The caseworker must not refuse an application because the evidence is not in a particular format, but may request alternative or additional evidence if they are not satisfied what the applicant (or their sponsor) has provided shows the requirements of the rules are met.</p>

<p>If evidence, such as a bank letter, does not include the information the caseworker would normally expect they should consider whether to take further action to verify it.</p>

<h3>Where evidence is missing or inadequate</h3>

<p>The applicant will be told what evidence to provide as part of the application process. However, sometimes evidence is missing or is inadequate to enable the caseworker to assess whether a requirement is met.</p>

<p>If evidence is missing or inadequate, the caseworker does not have to offer the applicant an opportunity to provide different evidence. For example, if the applicant provides bank statements and they do not show the required level of funds or the evidence is not sufficient to satisfy the caseworker, they do not need to check whether the applicant has another bank account that might meet the requirement.</p>

<p>However, the caseworker should consider seeking further information or making verification checks when, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence is missing (for example a missing page from a series) that they believe the applicant has, or could obtain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence is inadequate but could be clarified, for example, if a letter from an official financial sponsor does not include all the information the caseworker would expect</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The caseworker should check any discrepancies about information on the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) with the sponsor.</p>

<p>The caseworker may decide to ask for further information from the applicant or sponsor, or make verification checks in other cases if they think it would help assess whether the requirements are met. If the caseworker is not sure whether this would help, they should discuss this with a manager.</p>

<p>When contacting the applicant or sponsor, they should be given 10 UK working days to provide a response.</p>

<p>The caseworker does not need to contact the applicant or sponsor if evidence is missing or inadequate, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they do not need the information because they can get it elsewhere, for example, from the CoS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>receiving it would make no difference to their decision (for example because the applicant would still be refused for other reasons)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Failure to supply requested information</h3>

<p>If the caseworker requests additional information from the applicant or their sponsor, the caseworker should ask them to provide this, or an explanation why they are unable to, within 10 working days of the date of the request.</p>

<p>If the requested information is not received within this timeframe, the caseworker must assess whether the explanation provided is reasonable and if so, they may allow the applicant additional time to respond. If the applicant does not provide a satisfactory explanation, the caseworker may refuse the application.</p>

<h2>Translating documents</h2>

<p>This page tells caseworkers when they can accept translated documents for T2 Minister of Religion applications.</p>

<p>If a document provided is not in English or Welsh, the applicant must provide a fully certified translation from a professional translator or translation company that can be independently verified by the Home Office. The translation must include all of the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmation that it is an accurate translation of the document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the date of translation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the full name and signature of the translator or an official from the translation company</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the translator or translation company’s contact details</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If no translation is provided, the caseworker should request one. If, after this, the applicant does not provide a translation, or the caseworker is unable to verify the translation, the document will not be accepted. The caseworker must continue to process the application as if the applicant had not provided the document.</p>
