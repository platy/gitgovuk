<p>Terms of reference</p>

<p>Client: this is the proposed Permit Holder. The person who must accept these terms and conditions in order to obtain a Permit.</p>

<p>Agent: The Client (Permit Holder) can appoint an agent to act on its behalf to complete and submit the Permit application. The Agent is authorised to represent the Client in discussions with the Coal Authority, and enter into and / or create binding obligations with the Coal Authority.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/permit-process">View the Coal Authority’s permit process</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Condition 1</h2>
<p>The Client shall, for a period of 12 years from the effective date (as defined on the Permit Certificate), indemnify the Coal Authority (“the Authority”) against liability for any claims, losses or damages, including those made under the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991, from any party, arising as a result of any works carried out on the site by the Client, Client’s Agent its Designers, and/or Contractors. This provision applies to all works carried out on the site affecting Coal Authority property. Accordingly, in addition to works authorised by the Permit, the indemnity also applies to any works which go beyond the scope of works permitted in the Permit Certificate (i.e. unauthorised works, whether foreseen or otherwise) and works which would otherwise have been required to have been authorised by the Authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Condition 2</h2>
<p>It is the sole responsibility of the Client to appoint a Designer (if required) for the works and comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements (including, but not limited to, safety) for the works. In issuing a Permit Certificate (or otherwise authorising works), the Authority is not providing any confirmation or approval of the design of the works, and will have no liability for the design and/or safety of the works. All responsibility for suitable and sufficient design and risk assessment ultimately rests with the Client.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Condition 3</h2>
<p>In accepting these terms and conditions, I confirm that my Agent (see Agent Details box at Condition 24 below) is authorised to complete and submit the Permit application form on my behalf, liaise with any other parties, make decisions on my behalf and represent me in all discussions with the Coal Authority and enter into and/or create binding obligations on my behalf with the Coal Authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Condition 4</h2>
<p>It is a material condition of a Permit Certificate being issued that the Client or the Clients Agent completing the application form confirms the details of all contractors to be engaged in works at the site. This information must be provided in the Permit application form. No contractor is to be permitted access to a site affecting Coal Authority property without the prior approval of the Coal Authority. Unless the Client is representing themselves in discussions with the Authority, they must  confirm to the Authority using Condition 24 below, which party (if any) is authorised to act as its Agent with regard to permitting matters with the Authority. A Permit Certificate will not be issued until all of this information is provided to the Authority. If additional contractors are engaged during the course of the works, or the authorised agent is changed, the Client must advise the Authority of any such changes within 5 working days. Until the Coal Authority is notified by the Client to the contrary, the Coal Authority will continue to deal with an Agent as an agent authorised to act on behalf of the Client</p>

<p>The Client will be considered in breach of these terms and conditions if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Client, their Agent or Contractors are in breach of conditions referred to on a Coal Authority Permit Certificate issued to them or in writing thereafter by a Permitting Manager;</li>
  <li>the Client, their Agent or Contractors employ a method of working not declared in writing by the Authority or on a valid Permit Variation Certificate; and/or</li>
  <li>the Client, their Agent or Contractors undertake any works on Authority property that is not within the latest permit boundary plan issued to them by the Authority or on features that are not within the scope of the Permit Certificate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Condition 5</h2>
<p>Any permission granted will cease at any point that the Client no longer has significant control over the site or works being undertaken. The terms and conditions will continue to apply to all works carried out at the site by the Client, its Designers and/or Contractors. This includes but is not limited to, the full provisions in Condition 1 (Indemnity) and Condition 6 (Insurance) which will continue to apply in respect of the works carried out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Condition 6</h2>
<p>It is a material condition of a Permit Certificate being issued that the Client has reliance on suitable and sufficient insurance to cover the full liability of the Client under Condition 1 (Indemnity) above. Such insurance must be maintained for the period of 12 years from the effective date (as defined in the Permit Certificate). Failure to obtain (or maintain) adequate insurance will not affect the liability of the Permit Holder under any of the conditions in these terms and conditions (including but not limited to Condition 1 above). However, the Authority may request evidence that insurance cover is in place at any time during the period of these terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Condition 7</h2>
<p>If at any time the Authority considers the Client, the Client’s Agent Designers or Contractors to be in substantial breach of any of the obligations or conditions of these terms and conditions or the application form, the Authority may terminate the Permit (or authorisation for works) by written notice. Where a Permit Termination Notification is served, all activities interfering with the Authority’s interest must cease with immediate effect. In the event that the Permit (or authorisation) is terminated, the Client will be required to reimburse the Authority for all costs incurred by the Authority in making works at the site which affect the Authority’s property safe and, if deemed required by the Authority, returning the same to the pre-works condition.</p>

<p>These terms and conditions will continue to apply to all works carried out at the site by the Client, its Designers and/or Contractors up to the date of termination of the Permit (or authorisation) for the works. This includes, but is not limited to, the full provisions in Condition 1 (Indemnity) above which will apply in respect of the works. Where such breaches of these terms and conditions or the application form do not, in the opinion of the Authority (acting reasonably), jeopardise public safety, the Client may be given reasonable opportunity (as determined by the Authority) to remedy any such breach prior to the Permit (or authorisation) being terminated. In that event, a Permit Suspension Notification form will be issued to the Client. Where such a notification is served, no further works can be carried out until the Client is notified by the Authority. These terms and conditions will continue to apply for the whole period whilst the Permit is suspended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Condition 8</h2>
<p>The Permit Holder must notify the Authority as soon as reasonably practicable, using the 24 hour Emergency Service on 0800 288 4242, when there is evidence of spontaneous combustion of coal, uncontrolled/ harmful emissions of mine gas or water or other mining related hazards, has occurred during the course of the  permitted activities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Condition 9</h2>
<p>In the event that the Client identifies that any additional works are required beyond the scope of the Permit granted by the Authority, the Client must obtain further permission from the Authority to cover all such works (to enter, disturb or change coal mines or coal owned by the Authority) to be carried out. This permission must be sought before the additional works are carried out. This obligation applies to all additional works beyond the scope of the Permit, with the exception of emergency works required to mitigate against an immediate threat to life or the environment. In that event, the Authority must be notified of the works as soon as reasonably practicable. The Client must also obtain further authorisation from the Authority to change the method for carrying out authorised works or to extend the period for the works beyond the 12 month term authorised in the Permit Certificate. The Authority will review the application and, if approved, will issue a Permit Variation Certificate for the additional works and/or alteration to the method for the works. In no circumstances may the Client, the Client’s Agent or its Designers, and/or Contractors, carry out any works until such time as a Permit Variation Certificate has been issued by the Authority, authorising the works. In the event that unauthorised works are carried out before a Permit Variation Certificate is issued (including emergency works), the provisions of any of the conditions in these terms and conditions (including but not limited Condition 1 (Indemnity) above shall nonetheless apply. The Client will be liable under the indemnity provisions for all works relating to Authority property that have been carried out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Condition 10</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed a Permit shall be valid for 12 months from the effective date, as defined on the Permit Certificate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Condition 11</h2>
<p>All costs incurred in compliance of the terms of this Permit shall be borne by the Client.</p>
