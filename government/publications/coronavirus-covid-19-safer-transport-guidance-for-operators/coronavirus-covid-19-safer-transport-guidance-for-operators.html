<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide will help transport organisations in England understand how to provide safer workplaces and services for themselves, their workers and passengers. It outlines measures to assess and address the risks of coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>).</p>

<p>There is also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">guidance for passengers on how to travel safely</a>. Passengers are advised to check with operators over any policies they may have put in place before travelling.</p>

<p>Transport operators linked to the visitor economy sector, such as coach tour operators and those involved with private aircraft and boat hire, should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/the-visitor-economy#sec-2-1">visitor economy guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-taxis-and-phvs">guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle drivers, operators and owners</a>.</p>

<p>Operators should make themselves aware of the rules that could impact cross-border services and where possible inform passengers.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Check the guidance for other UK nations: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/coronavirus-safer-transport-guidance-operators" rel="external">Northern Ireland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/transport-transition-plan/guidance-for-transport-operators" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/restarting-public-transport-guidance-operators" rel="external">Wales</a>.</p>

<h2>People with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> and their contacts</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement for people with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> infection to self-isolate. However, if you have any of the main symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> or a positive test result, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts/covid-19-people-with-covid-19-and-their-contacts">public health advice is to stay at home and avoid contact with other people</a>.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own conditions of carriage and people should check with the operator of the service they are using before travelling.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales</h3>

<p>There may be rules for wearing face coverings for workers in other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. Check the guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-overview-and-advice" rel="external">Northern Ireland guidance</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings" rel="external">Scotland guidance</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions" rel="external">Wales guidance</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>Under applicable health and safety law, transport operators, as employers, and employers of those who work out of vehicles, must carry out a risk assessment.</p>

<p>This includes risks from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is a workplace hazard. You should manage it in the same way as other workplace hazards.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in the workplace</li>
  <li>identifying control measures to manage that risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment and put in place sufficient control measures to manage the risk may be considered a breach of health and safety law.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything necessary. The Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" rel="external">risk assessment tools to support you</a>.</p>

<p>You should review your risk assessment regularly to ensure it remains relevant and appropriate.</p>

<p>You do not have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment if you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have fewer than 5 workers</li>
  <li>are self-employed</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may still find it useful to do so.</p>

<p>All existing non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> related health and safety requirements continue to apply. For example, where personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is used to protect against non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risks, it should continue to be used. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" rel="external"><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr></a> and other transport regulators can help you comply with health and safety legislation.</p>

<h3>Consult your workers</h3>

<p>You have a duty to consult workers on health and safety. Workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership. You should encourage workers to identify, speak up and provide feedback on risks and control measures.</p>

<p>You can consult workers by listening and talking to them about the work they do and how you will manage the risks from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. You may do this by consulting with any recognised trade union health and safety representatives, or with a representative chosen by workers.</p>

<p>To support workers who are at higher risk of becoming severely unwell, you should discuss any concerns individuals may have around their particular circumstances and reassure them about the protective measures in place. Information from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) can be used to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">identify high risk groups</a>. <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> has further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/protect-people.htm" rel="external">how to protect vulnerable workers</a>.</p>

<h3>Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You should share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, consider publishing the results on your website to show workers, passengers and customers that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>properly assessed their risk</li>
  <li>taken appropriate measures to mitigate this</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessible transport</h2>

<p>Operators running passenger services need to consider accessibility at every stage of the passenger journey and their duties under equality, discrimination and health and safety law. Passenger assistance should be a normal part of the offering that passengers can request at the point of need. You should provide staff with disability, equality and awareness training in line with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-transport-strategy">inclusive transport strategy</a>.</p>

<h3>Workers with protected characteristics</h3>

<p>As for any workplace risk, you must consider specific duties to those with protected characteristics. It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of their age, sex, disability, race or other protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Read the government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights">guidance on discrimination</a></p>

<p>As an employer, you have particular responsibilities towards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>customers and passengers with disabilities</li>
  <li>workers with disabilities</li>
  <li>expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees">See the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> advice for pregnant employees</a>.</p>

<p>Consider providing support for workers around mental health and wellbeing. This could include guidance or telephone support, for example.</p>

<p>See current guidance related to statutory sick pay due to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay">statutory sick pay for employers</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">statutory sick pay for employees</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p>Where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is already being used in work activity to protect against non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risks, it should continue to be used. Any use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be determined by an assessment of risks in the workplace.</p>

<p>Unless the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> spreading is very high, risk assessments should reflect the fact that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has an extremely limited role in providing extra protection.</p>

<p>If a risk assessment does show that personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is required, then it must be provided free of charge to workers who need it. Any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided must fit properly.</p>

<p>Advice for workers and employers in non-clinical settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-strategy-stabilise-and-build-resilience"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> plan</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ventilation</h2>

<p>Good ventilation brings fresh or cleaned air into indoor spaces. The fresher the air that is brought inside, the more diluted any airborne virus will become. In poorly ventilated spaces, residual viruses can remain in the air after an infected person has left and increase the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> spreading.</p>

<p>You should consider how to maximise the supply of fresh air in vehicles, carriages, transport hubs and office buildings.</p>

<p>Further advice on ventilation in vehicles and buildings, including staff areas and enclosed public spaces such as waiting rooms, can be found in <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external">Ventilation and air conditioning during the coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic</a> guidance.</p>

<h2>Workforce planning</h2>

<h3>Protecting workers in the workplace</h3>

<p>Read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working safely during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a> for advice on how to reduce the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> transmission in the workplace.</p>

<h2>Queues and protecting passenger flows</h2>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>For security searches, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> recommends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first asking passengers if they have any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" rel="external">recognised symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>that staff consider wearing gloves for each search and wash their hands as frequently as possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working from or out of vehicles</h2>

<p>This section is relevant to those who work from vehicles or similar environments, where the worker spends most of their daily worktime in the vehicle, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>couriers</li>
  <li>mobile workers who use their vehicle as their base location and travel to fulfil their job role</li>
  <li>lorry drivers</li>
  <li>field forces</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://n-a-s-p.co.uk/coronavirus-advice/" rel="external">Approved driving instructors can obtain further advice from The National Associations Strategic Partnership</a>.</p>

<p>Those operating vehicles in depots warehouses or factories should also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/factories-plants-and-warehouses">follow the working safely during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Under health and safety law employers must carry out a risk assessment.</p>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing the number of people travelling in the same vehicle where possible</li>
  <li>opening windows to improve the flow of fresh air. You could also open windows and doors of vehicles to help clear the air before anyone else gets in</li>
  <li>switching on ventilation systems in vehicles- they should be set to draw in fresh and not to recirculate it.</li>
  <li>ensuring vehicles are regularly cleaned, in particular between different users</li>
  <li>providing guidance to drivers and temporary staff on the steps they can take to reduce risks when travelling in a vehicle</li>
  <li>bearing in mind the needs of those with protected characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>You should follow guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">cleaning and waste disposal</a>.</p>

<h2>Communications and training</h2>

<p>Transport operators should keep workers and passengers informed of the latest <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> related safety procedures. You should share the government’s most recent guidance to all workers and organise training sessions on how to work or interact safely with colleagues and the public. Operators and businesses should carefully consider the best ways to share advice on how to travel safely to passengers.</p>

<p>For workers, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engaging with workers through unions, work councils and other workers’ bodies to quickly explain and agree any changes in working arrangements</li>
  <li>letting workers know in advance if they are required to travel or not</li>
  <li>communicating clearly and regularly to improve understanding and consistency of how ways of working are applied</li>
  <li>providing communication and training materials on new procedures
    <ul>
      <li>training should include disability, equality and awareness training</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>building awareness and focus on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/" rel="external">importance of mental health at times of uncertainty</a>
</li>
  <li>providing guidance for workers assisting people with protected characteristics, for example, people with disabilities, the elderly and pregnant women</li>
</ul>

<p>For passengers, before travel, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advising passengers of how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#travel-safely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">travel safely</a>
</li>
  <li>providing passengers with information on timetables, expected journey times, expected capacity, delays and changes to normal routes</li>
  <li>supplying information on provision and any changes to assistance services for those with protected characteristics – for example, people with disabilities, the elderly and pregnant women – and how they can continue to access transport in a safe way</li>
  <li>making communications available in different formats so they are accessible to all</li>
</ul>

<p>For passengers, during travel, you could consider:</p>

<ul>

<h2>International travel</h2>

<p>You should consider this guidance when operating services arriving into or departing from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and adhere to legal requirements and guidance set by foreign governments when operating in other countries.</p>

<p>Passengers and operators should check the guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travel abroad from England</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travel to England from another country</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When operating in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, consideration should also be given to legislation and any guidance issued by the devolved governments of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Read about:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronovirus-travel" rel="external">travel advice for Wales</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement in England to wear a face covering. The government suggests that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own conditions of carriage and people should check with the operator of the service they are using before travelling.</p>

<h3>Aviation</h3>

<p>All aviation operators should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-aviation-guidance-for-operators">safer aviation guidance for operators</a>.</p>

<h3>Maritime Travel</h3>

<p>Maritime refers to all travel by sea including cruises for the purpose of pleasure, both domestic and international, and commercial shipping.</p>

<p>There is separate guidance relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-cruise-ship-travel">domestic cruises</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-grassroots-sports-guidance-for-the-public-and-sport-providers">recreational boating and other grassroots sports</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Status of this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance must be considered alongside legal duties and other guidance produced by the government and the relevant transport regulator for each mode. It contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying with these existing obligations. Transport providers should remain mindful of their obligations under both health and safety and employment legislation.</p>

<p>Each operator will need to translate this into the specific actions to take depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of business and how it is organised, operated, managed and regulated.</p>

<p>This guidance does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health and safety, employment or equalities, and it is important that as a business or an employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations, including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics. When considering how to apply this guidance, consider agency workers, contractors and other people, as well as your employees.</p>
